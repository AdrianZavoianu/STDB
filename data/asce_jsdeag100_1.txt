AB - Brick, brick prisms, and mortar specimens were impregnated with methyl methacrylate and polymerized by either a thermal-catalytic process or irradiation. Common brick and high-strength brick were used in the investigation. Compressive strength of polymer-impregnated common brick prisms increased 200% to 300% over the strength with a maximum of 18,088 psi, apparently the highest ever reported. Brick compressive strength and moduli of rupture, and mortar compressive and tensile strength also showed significant increases due to polymerization. The mortar-brick bond strength increased by more than 10 times. Thermal-catalytic polymerization produced higher strengths for common brick prisms and mortar specimens while polymerization achieved by irradiation produced higher strengths in the high-strength brick prisms. No significant differences were observed in the strengths of the brick polymerized by the two methods.

AB - This paper describes the development and verification of analysis procedures for predicting the performance of a wood joist floor system at service loads. The analysis procedure incorporates the interaction of the many material and system characteristics including interlayer slip, variable material properties, and composite and two-way action. Parameter studies showing the influence of major variables on floor system behavior are presented. Experimental results obtained from beam and floor tests are compared with predicted values calculated using the developed mathematical model. Floor behavior at overload levels is considered. The rational analysis procedures presented can form the basis for improved design procedures for wood joist structural systems with resulting important implications in housing and other construction.

The model, which was a 1:2.82 scale replica of a prototype, had overall plan dimensions of 72 ft (21.14 m) long by 12 ft (3.66 m) wide. Experimental results are given for reaction, steel and concrete strains, deflections, and moments due to conditioning overloads producing stress values as high as 2.5 times the nominal design stress. The loading to failure and the ultimate strength behavior is examined. The live-load overload capacity of the bridge is evaluated.

The derivation of boundary stiffness coefficients from the Vogt parameters for direct application to three-dimensional finite element analysis is presented. The formulation neither increases the number of degrees-of-freedom above that required for the dam structure, nor creates any additional nonzero coefficients within the assembled structural matrix.

AB - A state-of-the-art review regarding the thermal behavior of bridges and considerations to be given to the resultant thermal effects is presented. The results of studies related to the thermal effects on bridges are reviewed. Studies attempting to relate environmental factors to bridge temperatures, and subsequently to bridge movements and stresses, indicate that the task is extremely complex. Some correlation has been made between equations predicting bridge temperatures and movements based on weather bureau records. However, further research is needed to evaluate the effects of factors other than temperature, such as creep, shrinkage, and humidity, on bridge movements and stresses.

AB - A step-by-step numerical procedure is used to compute the inelastic response of single-bay braced and unbraced steel frame structures. The dynamic response is computed by assuming an elasto-plastic type hysteresis behavior in tension only for the diagonal bracing members, in bending for the girders, and in bending with axial force effect on the plastic moment and the P-Δ effect included for the columns. The N-S component of the 1940 El Centro earthquake with the accelerations multiplied by 1.5 is used. The responses of several 10-story frames having varying arrangements of bracing members are proportioned by two different design philosophies. The first series is designed by using current code procedures, and the second series is a class of period-controlled structures. The results indicate that even light diagonal bracing members can significantly reduce lateral displacement and inelastic activity in the columns and girders. The axial force in the columns and floor accelerations can be substantially increased.

AB - A procedure based on the force method of analysis and using linear programming is presented for a minimum weight optimum design of stress limited indeterminate trusses. The problem is initially cast as a linear optimization problem considering only equilibrium conditions and stress limits. Thereafter, additional approximate linear conditions are annexed to the initial formulation and the solution is repeated yielding a more nearly compatible design. The process is then repeated refining these additional conditions in each iteration until a compatible design is obtained. The simplex method is used to solve the linear programming problem in each iteration cycle. The relatively simple mathematical programming formulation is shown to be efficient as well as having the ability to modify the configuration of the structure by vanishing unnecessary members. A computer program based on this method and the results of some examples are presented.

AB - Case studies of three destructive hurricanes: Carla, Camille, and Celia, as they moved inland, were performed to determine the change in horizontal wind speed distribution. Criteria for determining the storm's intensity were employed to describe storms in sparse data regions, i.e., while over the sea, to conform with their eventual description in relatively data-rich regions while over land. These criteria were considered critically as the storm's winds decreased after landfall. Resulting models of peak gust distribution for each storm are shown. Comparisons are made with Malkin's (1959) factors for wind decrease. Although the storms occurred after Malkin's study, his factors are representative of the synoptic maxima in two storms. For peak gusts other than the synoptic maxima, and for all peak gusts in the third storm, other considerations should be made for engineering estimates.

AB - A method of analysis of eccentrically stiffened plate structures in the elastic-plastic range is presented. The method, which is based on the incremental finite element displacement approach, employs layered beam elements attached to layered plate elements in order to be able to describe the process of plastification. The developed approach allows studying of the entire load-deformation behavior and of the process of plastification of complex shaped and loaded stiffened plate structures and, therefore, will ultimately permit a more rational design of such structures.

The effects of the variations in the length of a uniformly distributed surface load, the relative soil-pipe stiffness, and the presence of a layer of soft material around the pipe with various Poisson's ratios, are examined. It is suggested that the existing laboratory tests do not conform to the actual field conditions and, therefore, full-scale tests must be conducted to verify the results reported herein. Recommendations for future analytical research are also made.

A detailed description of the design philosophy is presented. Inelastic dynamic responses of two 40-story buildings designed with different levels of elastic lateral force resisting capabilities subject to 1.5 times the El Centro (1940) NS accelerogram are compared. It is shown that this framing system has significant energy absorption capacity and ductile deformation capability.

SO - Journal of the Structural Division 1974-01-01 100(1): 195-208
AB - Four prediction equations are developed based on the assumptions that the composite material will behave either orthotropically or isotropically when buckling occurs and that in either case, the tangent modulus theory or the double modulus theory would prevail. The results of these analyses are applied to 24 reinforced concrete plates which were tested in uniaxial compression. The buckling loads obtained for these plates are compared with those predicted by the various formulas. The maximum difference between predictions obtained from these formulas is about 25%. It is concluded that the assumption of isotropic behavior along with the tangent modulus buckling theory yields essentially conservative, yet fairly accurate results. Formulas based on this case and incorporating certain simplifications are developed and proposed for the analysis and design of these plates.

AB - Torsional stiffness of a reinforced concrete spandrel beam is known to decrease drastically after cracking and to cause redistribution of moment between the spandrel beams and the floor beams in building frames. In this study, 10 T-shape specimens representing a floor beam framing monolithically into a spandrel beam were tested. Test results show that large angles of twist under constant torque can be obtained after cracking and that the limit design method is desirable for designing spandrel beams. In using the limit design concept a specified torsional stress is sufficient to ensure ductility and crack control. In addition, methods are suggested for the design of joint stirrups to prevent joint failure, stirrups in the floor beam to prevent shear failure, and negative steel in the floor beam.

Experiments are described and it is shown that the curved beam approximation is more accurate in predicting hole edge stresses for high ratios of hole diameter to beam depth and under high shear-to-moment ratio.

AB - In the present AISC specification, two formulas govern the requirements for stiffening the compression region of an interior steel beam-to-column connection. The first formula gives the strength a column web will develop in resisting the compression forces delivered by beam flanges. The second formula concerns the limiting ratio. This formula and the instability effect have not been completely examined. A total of nine tests using dial gages to monitor the deflection of the applied load and another gage to monitor the lateral deflection of column web were performed to accomplish this. The results showed that the present AISC specifications are conservative for all grades of steel.

AB - This technical note presents the finite element solution for the St. Venant's torsion of nonhomogeneous and anisotropic sections. The mathematical formulation is based on the stress function. In this analysis, the curved, isoperimetric, quadrilateral element with cubic displacement variation has been used instead of simple triangular or quadrilateral elements. The use of the higher order elements has several advantages, including its versatility in mapping the difficult but real configurations involving curved boundaries, better accuracy, and less effort in the preparation of data for the computer program due to the use of fewer elements. Several examples are presented to show the advantages.
