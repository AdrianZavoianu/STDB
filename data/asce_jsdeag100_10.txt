AB - The earthquake responses of a spirally reinforced concrete column carrying a concentrated mass and subjected to the simultaneous action (biaxial response) of both horizontal components of normalized 1940 El Centro, 1962 Taft, and 1971 Pacoima Dam accelerograms were studied. Two different masses, corresponding to initial elastic periods of 0.65 and 1.5 sec, were considered. The column force-displacement characteristics were synthesized from idealized stress-strain properties for steel and confined and unconfined concrete, using a discretization of the column cross section combined with finite element techniques. Maximum displacements were significantly larger in biaxial response when excitation was sufficiently intense in relation to the column strength to cause appreciable inelastic deformation. If planar analysis indicates inelastic response in a column resisting earthquake effects in both horizontal directions, the effects of the axial load (P-Δ effect) may be more critical and the required ductility may be larger than that based on planar analysis.

AB - The combined effects of local buckling, overall column buckling, and nonuniform material properties in compression members are studied. The results are given for 34 tests on two types of columns, one with local buckling occurring in elements supported along both longitudinal edges, and one with local buckling occurring in elements along only one longitudinal edge. Based on these tests, an analytical approach is presented for predicting the ultimate strength of columns subject to the factors just mentioned. Column buckling is accounted for by means of the tangent modulus concept and post-buckling behavior of plate elements by utilizing the effective width expression developed by the third writer. A simpler approximation of the analytical approach is also given for routine design.

AB - The bending effects in the shell arise from two primary sources: (1) the radial forces applied through the ring stiffeners; and (2) the geometrical discontinuity at the cylindrical-conical shell junction. These bending effects are largely uncoupled and exhibit some interdependence only when the lower ring stiffener is very close to the cylindrical-conical junction. When the lower ring stiffener is located close to the junction, there appears to be a beneficial coupling of the two sources of bending with reduced values of the hoop stress and junction bending moment. The bending moment at the vicinity of the lower ring stiffener is increased slightly, with the increase being less for larger values of the ring cross-sectional area. The effect of the bending rigidity of the vertical stiffeners, as reflected by the equivalent ring thickness, was minimal; thus, the primary benefit derived from such stiffeners is their action, in conjunction with the ring stiffeners, to form a circular ring girder capable of distributing the column reactions uniformly around the circumference.

AB - The results of the program are derived from 80 tests on specimens in the form of planks measuring 36 in. x 6 in. x 1 in. (914 mm x 152 mm x 25 mm) subjected to third point loading in flexure. Variables include the type, amount, strength, and orientation of the reinforcement and the strength and density of the mortar. Comparisons of the performance of systems reinforced with expanded metal, welded mesh, woven mesh, parallel strand wire, and standard bars show that there are major differences with respect to both absolute strength and degree of conformity to the predictions of ultimate load analysis. Moreover, the order of superiority of the different systems depends on whether the application involves uniaxial or biaxial bending. Generally, these differences are associated with factors not taken into account in the standard load analysis-the geometry, orientation, and interlayer spacing of the reinforcement.

AB - A method of analysis of the global behavior of long curved or straight single-cell girders with or without initial stress is presented. It is based on thin-wall beam elements that include the modes of longitudinal warping and of transverse distortion of cross section. Deformations due to shear forces and transverse bimoment are included, and it is found that the well-known spurious shear stiffness in very slender beams is eliminated by virtue of the fact that the interpolation polynomials for transverse displacements and for longitudinal displacements (due to rotations and warping) are linear and quadratic, respectively, and an interior mode is used. The element is treated as a mapped image of one parent unit element and the stiffness matrix is in integration in three dimensions, which is numerical in general, but could be carried out explicitly in special cases. Numerical examples of deformation of horizontally curved bridge girders, and of lateral buckling of box arches, as well as straight girders, validate the formulation and indicate good agreement with solutions by other methods.

AB - A method is presented for calculating the nonlinear dynamic response of three-dimensional cable networks. Large changes in geometry are considered in the analysis. The method is applied to three typical cable networks, a planar network, a hyperbolic roof net, and a general three-dimensional layered system. Static response, mode shapes and frequencies, and the development of frequency-amplitude curves are all examined. Agreement, where available, with experimental data appears to be quite good.

AB - A method of analysis of time-dependent behavior has been developed for composite prestressed concrete beams under dead load and superimposed dead loads. This method takes into account the shrinkage and creep of web concrete, relaxation of prestressing steel, presence of untensioned reinforcing steel, differential shrinkage, and differential creep. The analysis is similar to the stiffness method of analysis of structures, except that the stiffness of the cross section varies in each interval of time; thus, it is called varying stiffness method. The results obtained by this analysis are found to be in good agreement with experimental values. Above all, it involves only two unknowns compared to a maximum of seven in the conventional method. Thus, this method is recommended for analysis of composite beams.

AB - A computerized finite difference method is presented for the analysis of slender reinforced concrete columns. The method is developed in detail for the particular case of columns fixed at the base and prevented from deflecting laterally at the top as compressive loading is applied. Columns may have variations of cross section along their lengths. A longitudinal plane of symmetry is assumed in which buckling takes place. Allowance is made for the effects of cracking of the concrete, initial lack of straightness, and initial deflection of the top of the column by cantilever action. Reduction in the capacity of the column arising from the creep of the concrete is examined.

Numerical methods are available for analysis of such footings. Charts to aid in the design of the footings are presented. These charts are based on equations of equilibrium. Linear and parabolic stress-strain distributions of soil are considered. The use of charts is illustrated by two examples.

The connection of the column to the shell wall is often eccentric with respect to the middle surface of the shell. The purpose of this note is to present a method whereby the equilibrated moment in the connection is evaluated by considering the relative stiffness of the columns and the shell wall. A case study of a steel tank filled with water is considered.

AB - Programmable calculators are being used for many civil engineering applications. From a programming standpoint, a major difficulty is the limited number of program steps and data storage locations available with programmable calculators. This note presents a procedure for determining an approximation to the fundamental frequency of a shear flexible structure using a programmable calculator with as few as 14 data storage locations and 225 program steps. A number of structures was investigated to determine the accuracy of the approximate method. The approximation involved is shown to yield results within 2% of exact values.
