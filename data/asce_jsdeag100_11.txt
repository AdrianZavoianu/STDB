AB - A gradient method is formulated for the least-weight design of structural systems, represented by finite element assemblages, that must sustain prescribed buckling loads. An approach applied previously to free vibration problems is extended to stability problems. Included are the effects of nonlinear weight-stiffness relationships and a lower-bound constraint on the design parameter. Results are compared with existing analytical solutions for single-span columns involving nonlinear weight-stiffness relations and the method is applied to cases of continuous columns and frameworks. A further practical use of the method incorporates an averaging technique whereby design parameters over prescribed segments are constrained to vary uniformly.

AB - A study was made on the use of the Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) for the design of steel members cold-formed from thick sheets and plates. Experiments were conducted to study the increase in yield point caused by the cold work of forming. The investigation indicates that the design formulas for determining the effective design width of stiffened elements and the allowable stress for unstiffened compression elements currently included in the AISI Specification can be conservatively used for sections cold-formed from thick sheets and plates. It was also found that the AISI design provision for computing corner yield point provides good results for thick steel sheets and plates having a sharp yielding stress-strain curve with a small plateau and for cold-rolled sheets and strip.

AB - Local flange buckling and lateral buckling are studied theoretically and experimentally to determine the ultimate strength of composite beams in negative moment regions. The effect of the strain-hardening of steel on ultimate strength is included in the analysis. Based on analysis and results of tests, the ultimate moment capacity of composite beams with compact wide-flange sections is determined by local flange buckling, unless the compression flange is stiffened by cover plates. Local flange buckling and lateral buckling analysis based on tangent modulus theory provides good agreement with experimental results.

AB - A general method based on the equilibrium of the deflected structure is presented for finding the loads causing lateral instability of open-web structures of any geometry and support conditions. The stiffness matrix is generated for the deflected position of each of the elements and the condition for buckling is that the determinant of the matrix vanishes. As each element of the matrix is an intrinsic function of the axial force in the member, this forms a nonlinear eigenvalue problem and thus the buckling loads are found out by iteration. Experiments were conducted on three open-web girders and the results are compared with the computed results. A number of examples solved for open-web girders brings out the general behavior of such girders.

AB - A numerical method for computing the deflections and rotations up to the point of instability of elastically restrained inelastic beam columns is described. The cross section considered is open, thin-walled, and arbitrary in shape. The external forces, applied at ends of the beam column, could include a normal force, two bending moments, two shear forces, or a torsional moment or a combination of these. The restraints are represented by elastic rotational or directional springs, or both, at each end of the beam column. The material considered is ideally elastic-plastic and residual stresses are included in the analysis. The equilibrium equations are written with respect to an arbitrary system of orthogonal coordinate axes. The influence of the shift in the shear center and the shift and rotation of the principal axes of partially plastified sections are thus taken care of automatically in the analysis. The resulting fourth-order nonlinear differential equations are solved using finite differences and the tangent stiffness method.

AB - Analyses are presented for determining the collapse load of a beam curved in a circular arc and subtending a central angle less than 180°. The analyses are for the case of two concentrated loads placed at any point on the beam and are an extension of existing analyses that have been developed for single concentrated loads or distributed loads. The modes of failure considered are valid for beams with constant plastic moment and torque capacities at any section of the beam. In the case of reinforced concrete, the analyses are thus restricted to prismatic beams having constant reinforcement. Tests were conducted on four curved reinforced concrete beams and it was found that the plastic theory gave a satisfactory prediction of the mode of failure, i.e., location and type of plastic hinges. The predicted value of the ultimate load was conservative for modes of failure containing pure bending and combined bending-torsion hinges, and slightly higher for modes of failure containing free hinges.

The present knowledge of member behavior and diaphragm action is assessed and the additional requirements for asymmetric structures are outlined. The factors that should be included in the analyses of asymmetric structures are described and the translation of the results of these analyses to design is summarized.

AB - The value of mathematical optimization tools for the cold-formed steel industry is investigated by using a particular technique to redesign a building systems product already being successfully marketed. The optimization technique employed is a variation of the cutting-plane method wherein a sequence of linear programming problems is solved to obtain the solution of the nonlinear problem. Twenty-four design parameters and 64 constraints, mostly nonlinear and drawn unchanged from the Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (AISI), form the nonlinear programming problem that is solved for the design. Most of the constraints involve buckling behavior of some form. An example using a member of the class of components that was redesigned is employed to demonstrate how the problem is set up for solution.

AB - Plexiglass cylindrical shell models with nearly perfect geometry and constant thickness were tested under various combinations of membrane stresses. In cylinders under axial compression alone and axial compression with internal pressure, the buckling procedure was initiated by means of a small dynamic disturbance which reduced the dispersion of the test results. The normal forces and bending moments in the middle of the model were measured. The number of buckling waves observed in the tests agreed quite well with the result of the classical theory for the laterally loaded cylindrical shell. Only the shape, the length, and the depth of the buckling waves changed with the stress state. A buckling criterion and an interaction curve realistic for civil engineering purposes are proposed for checking the stability of cylindrical shells with fixed ends under combined membrane stress states.

AB - This paper presents a numerical procedure to calculate the loss of prestress, the strain at centroid, and the curvature in concrete beams prestressed in a number of stages. The loss calculated is caused by instantaneous deformations, relaxation of steel, shrinkage, and creep of concrete. Account is made of the elastic and creep recoveries of concrete and the effect of variation of stress level on the relaxation of steel. Included is an application to find the losses and deflections of a prestressed concrete bridge built by the cantilever method (consecutive segments cast and prestressed in multistages).

AB - Experimentally-determined transient wind pressures on a rigid model of a circular concave roof are presented. The loadings are then used in an analytical investigation of the dynamic response of a cable network. Most of the energy of the turbulent pressure fluctuations appears to be concentrated at low frequencies and is somewhat dependent on the height to diameter ratio of the structure; however, no dominant periodicity in the pressure fluctuations is apparent. Correlation coefficients for pressures are approximately equal over the entire roof, indicating that the eddy size is fairly uniform throughout the separation bubble. Using a discrete element formulation, the lower natural frequencies of a concave cable network are found to be dependent only on the sag and diameter and are independent of the mass and stiffness of the system. The results of the dynamic statistical analysis indicate that the mean transverse displacements are relatively small compared with static values incurred under time-averaged pressures.

AB - In this technical note, an inverse problem of structural optimization is considered. The problem is motivated by many real-world situations and is stated as: Given a structure, how much load can this structure support safely? A mathematical programming problem that answers this question is presented for general trusses and is applied to a damaged 25-member transmission tower. The problem considered is how to maximize the loads that a given truss may support, subject to the requirements that it satisfy equations of equilibrium and compatibility, stress, displacement, and buckling constraints. The mathematical program shows how to redistribute the loads of a damaged structure so that it may be put to some other use.

Analysis shows that if the load history is regarded as a random sample from the probability distribution of the load magnitude, the probability distribution of the maximum load sustained by the floor during its life cycle can be calculated using standard results from probability theory.
