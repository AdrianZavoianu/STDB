AB - The behavior of reinforced concrete cooling shells is investigated under the effect of axisymmetric operating thermal loads and nonaxisymmetric solar thermal loads. Analytical and finite element techniques are applied, and stress and displacement results are compared to field measurements on the 420-ft high Martins Creek cooling tower. High flexural stresses due to operating thermal gradients are found to be relieved by meridional cracking of the shell, and the effect of this cracking is examined in relation to cooling-tower design.

AB - The bending strength and stiffness of both homogeneous and hybrid I-shaped beams vary with two geometric properties of the cross section: the web slenderness and the area ratio (ratio of web area to total area). Equations and charts defining the variation strength and stiffness with these two geometric properties are developed for beams with different combinations of flange and web steels. For both homogeneous and hybrid beams, the maximum bending strength and stiffness for a given cost are achieved by using the maximum permissible web slenderness (as limited by buckling or fabrication requirements) and an optimum area ratio is 1/2 for elastic strength and 2/3 for plastic strength. For hybrid beams, the optimum area ratios are higher, and increase as the web/flange yield-strength ratio decreases. For both homogeneous and hybrid beams, the optimum area ratio for stiffness is 3/4.

AB - In prestressed concrete beams with dapped ends, inclined shear cracks appear frequently at early stages of loading. A theoretical solution based on elasticity methods was formulated to represent the onset of failure at the dapped regions. The solution gave a quantitative prediction of the critical tensile stresses at a point close to and very near the dap root. Experiments were conducted on six prototype prestressed concrete T-beams. The beams were pretensioned longitudinally and were provided with post-tensioned, high-strength, steel web reinforcement. The variables included: (1) geometry of the dapped ends; (2) type of web reinforcement in dapped regions; (3) ratio of shear span to depth of beam; and (4) prestress level. The results indicated that shear strength of prestressed concrete beams can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, and that dapped regions can be prestressed with inclined high-strength steel bars to control shear cracking at the working load.

AB - Two finite element procedures which utilize the constant and the variable stiffness methods are presented. A combination of isoperimetric elements and bar elements is used for the representation of reinforced concrete plane elements. The analysis includes the effects of the propagation of cracking as well as the yielding of both steel and concrete. The analytical results of both methods are compared to the experimental results of others. The constant stiffness method is found to be inaccurate for the problems involving the prediction of cracking. Direct use of corner nodes is made in the computation of stiffness of the cracked element and the unbalanced nodal forces due to cracking or yielding.

AB - A summary of recent box-girder failures, a discussion of the design problems associated with box-girder bridges, and a review of the basis for current American design specifications are presented. The applicability of existing information to the formulation of an ultimate strength approach to box-girder design is considered. Design problems requiring additional study as well as research needs are discussed. It is concluded that considerable analytical and experimental work dealing with stiffened compression flange behavior, web behavior and their effects on the overall behaviors of box girders is required prior to the formulation of an ultimate strength approach to design.

AB - The increased use of steel poles for transmission lines has been closely related to the need for larger capacity electrical circuits in highly developed urban areas. Considerations in the design and fabrication of these structures differ greatly from those for laced type towers, particularly in respect to secondary moments due to pole deflection, design loadings, allowable stresses, and precautions in material selection and manufacturing procedures. The importance of quality control, as exercised by the manufacturer, and quality assurance, as required by the purchaser, are outlined. Special considerations in load testing and erection provisions are included and suggestions for foundation design are discussed. An extensive bibliography and appendix contain related material for additional guidance.

AB - The Task Committee on Structural Connections decided to survey the current state of research and research needs in the general area of structural connections in metal. The information was gathered from responses to a short questionnaire published in the July 1973 Newsletter of the Structural Division. Responses were received covering 13 projects either recently completed or currently underway. The projects fall into six broad categories: 1) fatigue behavior of connections, 2) fastener characteristics, 3) seismically loaded connections, 4) end plate connections, 5) beam-to-column connections, and 6) general analysis.
