AB - It has previously been shown that the stresses in beams in the region of circular holes without reinforcement can be satisfactorily obtained by either a theory of elasticity solution or a method in which parts of the beam near the hole are treated by curved beam theory. The appropriate method depends upon the ratio of hole diameter to beam depth and the shear-to-moment ratio. Design aids in the form of moment-shear interaction curves and based on the aforementioned theories are presented. These curves are given for hole diameter-to-beam depth ratios of 0.20 to 0.75, and for eccentricities of the hole center line from the mid-depth of the beam up to 0.25 of the beam depth.

AB - The natural frequencies of translational motion for the first two modes in each direction have been experimentally measured and computed analytically for two tall reinforced concrete shear wall buildings. For the first building, the frequencies were measured from ambient as well as man-excited data. The critical damping ratios were also estimated from the decay of the man-excited accelerograms. For the second building, the frequencies were estimated from ambient response data. The computer generated analytical models yielded reasonably satisfactory estimates for the fundamental frequencies for Building 1, but for Building 2, the estimated frequency in the longitudinal direction did not agree with its measured value.

AB - In the paper the results of an analytical study of the behavior of braced and unbraced frames and subassemblages is presented. The analysis assumes elastic perfectly plastic member response and includes the effects of axial loads on frame deformations, axial loads on member stiffness, axial shortening of columns, finite column width, and hinge reversal. The results of the analysis show that the lateral stiffness of braced and unbraced frames designed under similar conditions were approximately the same. The analysis shows that the PΔ effects significantly reduce the load carrying capacity of both types of structures, especially when these units are required to provide lateral support to more flexible frame units.

AB - An investigation into the failure of an off-ramp structure is described. A straight post-tensioned portal frame with drop-in spans failed during an intermediate stage of construction due to a torsional load applied at one end by a curved drop-in span. The mode of failure, as well as the analytical approach that explained the failure, is described. The analyses consisted of solving three models through the center, centroid, and column line of the main girder. The results indicated that failure was due to the low torsional stiffness and strength of the open-box girder section.

AB - The connections were loaded so that the bolts received tension. The effects of bolt load-deformation characteristics (ASTM A325 and A490), the tee geometry and the connection detailing were considered in the investigation. A two-dimensional finite element technique was used to model the flange of the connection and a typical nonlinear bolt load deformation curve accounted for the bolt behavior. The load distribution on the flange, the stresses in the flange, the bolt load, and the bolt deformation were computed at zero applied load in increments to ultimate. Failure was either by bolt rupture or formation of a plastic hinge in the flange. The prying forces which develop as a result of flange deformation are shown to cause substantial reduction in both the ultimate load capacity and the fatigue strength for certain connections. Empirical equations are presented for the prediction of the ultimate strength of tee connections.

AB - Simple expressions are given for the calculation of lower-bound yield moments for rectangular, orthotropically-reinforced concrete slabs under uniform load. Using these results, a limit states design method is developed. In this method, the areas of tension reinforcement required per unit width of the slab are designed for the calculated yield moments, using ultimate strength design provisions given in the codes. The positive reinforcement is provided throughout the slab; and the negative reinforcement must extend at least over the regions suggested in the paper. The serviceability requirements of the slab are satisfied by choosing the thickness of the slab to fulfill deflection requirements specified in the codes and by selecting the diameter of the reinforcing bar to satisfy the crack-control criterion developed in the paper. Simple expressions are also given for the calculation of edge-beam forces. The design method is illustrated by a numerical example.

AB - Damage to continuous framing caused by the lateral forces resulting from seismic tremors or cyclonic winds can be catastrophically severe. Cross sections forced early into plastic hinging may enter a failing stage prior to the development of ductile properties of remaining sections, or the formation of a collapse mechanism may occur with uncontrolled increases in strain at hinging sections. Analog computer studies are presented which lead to the conclusion that increases in strains should be accompanied by stress increases in order to minimize structural damage. Inhibiting the development of purely plastic conditions would also reduce the vulnerability of continuous framing to off center shifts of the axis of oscillation and the crawling effect of distortions in one direction. Steel without a yield plateau, low steel ratios, and confined compression reinforcement in all sections of a frame would reduce the susceptibility of a reinforced concrete framework to severe damage from severe natural phenomena such as earthquakes and cyclonic winds.

AB - It is shown that plastic analysis is a suitable method for analyzing structures composed of precast concrete panel walls mounted on a steel frame. The panels are bolted on the frame using connecting bolts embedded in the panels. These bolts are assumed to be elastic perfectly plastic. A yield locus for the panel-bolt-frame system is developed. With the aid of the yield locus the collapse load and mode of collapse for a panel frame system can be determined. Of particular interest is the use of panel walls as wind bracing and as partial bearing walls. Two illustrative examples of this type are described. With this method of analysis, full advantage can be taken of the panel's ability to transmit forces between points in the frame.

AB - Ductility is essential for the fabrication and adequate performance of cold-formed steel structures. For defining safe minimum values of ductility, it is first necessary to develop reliable ductility measurements. It is shown that the usual percent elongation in a 2-in. gage length of a standard rectangular coupon is not a consistent measure of ductility and that reduction in area is difficult to measure for sheet and strip steel specimens. Distinction is made between uniform elongation observed in a specimen over a length outside the fracture zone, and local elongation measured over a short length across the fracture. The separate and complementary roles of uniform and local ductility are presented. Several measures for these two distinct properties are described. Two methods for separately measuring uniform and local ductility by minor modifications of the standard ASTM tension test are proposed.

AB - Test evidence is presented on the performance under tension of perforated plates, bolted connections and formability of corners, supplemented by an elastic-plastic analysis of perforated and notched plates, in order to arrive at suggested lower limits of structurally satisfactory ductility. For a crude identification of adequately ductile steels, it is suggested that a minimum conventional elongation in 2 minimum tensile 7% and a minimum tensile to yield strength ratio of 1.05 may serve as criteria. It is not maintained that steels with even lower ductility cannot be used structurally for particular applications and under adequate controls.

AB - This note concerns the seismic behavior of single-bay, single-story, x-braced steel frames. The purpose of this study is to revise design criteria for these structures. Fifty systems are studied. Each structure is analyzed under the action of 10 simulated earthquakes. The most interesting measure of response is the maximum numerical values of the system's deformation. The maximum deformation can be estimated by assuming that it is equal to that of the corresponding equivalent elastic systems. This criterion is slightly conservative when viscous damping is negligible or when the frame stiffness amounts to not less than 25% of the total.

AB - If an eccentrically loaded column is stressed beyond the proportional limit, the stress-strain relation varies in a complex manner from point to point in the member. Since a rigorous analysis is extremely difficult, an approximate solution of the load-deflection curve is presented. It is based on two assumptions: 1) the column axis deflects in a half sine wave, and 2) the stress varies linearly across the section. This method is best suited for wide flange shapes bent about the major axis of symmetry.

AB - In a 1971 paper by Yokel, he presented an analysis for the ultimate load of eccentrically loaded compression members of rectangular cross section with no tensile strength. This paper extends the range of the analysis and gives general expressions for a load-slenderness ratio relationship for the entire range of eccentricity-depth ratio e/t.

AB - This technical note describes the feasibility of using precast concrete deck slabs in bridges. The laboratory tests consisted of the static testing of two T-beams—one cast-in-place and the other precast. The loading condition for each specimen is the same. Equal static loads are applied from each end of the long specimens. The testing of these specimens indicated that their behavior was essentially the same. While the load-deformation response shows that the cast-in-place T-beam is slightly stiffer, the tests indicate the feasibility of using precast elements in bridge construction.
