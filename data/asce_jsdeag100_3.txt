AB - The experimental results of tests on five models of one- and two-story flat plate structures subjected to uniformly distributed loads are presented. Included are the effects of the number of load points, static loads, and cyclic loads on deflection, cracking, and distribution of slab bending moments. The design and experimental load capacities of the models are compared.

AB - A mixed method and a computational procedure are presented for the analysis of pin-jointed trusses in the presence of both geometric and material nonlinearities. The problem is formulated in terms of both internal forces and joint displacements and the governing equations consist of the two sets of joint equilibrium equations and member force-displacement (constitutive) relations. Analysis is focused on the advantages of the mixed method over the traditional force and displacement methods, as well as on means of further improving the computational efficiency of the mixed method. The paper concludes with numerical examples showing application of the mixed method to nonlinear problems of plane as well as space trusses subjected to proportional loading. The constitutive relations in these examples are assumed, for convenience, to be represented by the Ramberg-Osgood polynomials.

AB - The warping and distortion at the ends of members of doubly symmetric I-sections are studied theoretically and experimentally, and the increases in the resistances to warping and distortion caused by web stiffeners or by additional webs are investigated. Analytical expressions are given for the warping and distortion restraint stiffnesses of single members. The behavior of rigid angle joints between I-section members is then studied, and it is deduced that the warping and distortion at a joint are interdependent. A finite element model is proposed, and this is used to determine the effects of member length, joint angle, and stiffener arrangement on the restraint against end warping. Simple approximations are obtained for estimating the warping restraints, and these are shown to be conservative.

AB - The behavior of tightly strung cables under uniformly distributed loading is considered. It is found that the relevant literature is not very extensive in view of the previous lack of practical applications. An expression is derived relating the cable deflection to the change in loading based on a parabolic approximation to the cable shape. Stresses in the cable are shown to be readily calculated. Equations for the unextended length of the cable lead to the consideration of the effect of temperature changes on deflected shape. The form of the analysis is shown to be suitable for the direct design of taut cables and this is demonstrated with an example.

AB - Several design criteria for isolated, simply supported steel H-columns subjected to compression and combined with biaxial bending are examined. The load carrying capacity of the columns is presented in terms of interaction surfaces. Three classes of problems are considered: short columns, long columns under symmetrical loading, and long columns under unsymmetrical loading conditions. The interaction surfaces are given in forms of tables suitable for analysis and design. Simple approximate formulas are also developed as an alternative method for the designer. The results are compared with the current Column Research Council design formulas.

AB - An 84-in. (2.14-m)-diam., reinforced concrete, dummy pipe culvert, with a 1,000-D load rating, was buried under 136 ft (41.5 m) of highway embankment. Six 40-ft (12.2-m)-long zones were subjected to the following bedding and backfill parameters: (1) pipe in trench, shaped bedding; (2) pipe in trench, unshaped, fine aggregate bedding; (3) positive projection, shaped bedding; (4) positive projection, 60° concrete bedding; (5) positive projection, pipe bedded on two 3 in. x 24 in. (7.6 cm x 61.0 cm) polystyrene planks; and (6) positive projection, line bearing on hard earth. Qualitative observations were made of progressive changes in cracking patterns, and measurements were made of pipe shape in each zone at intervals of fill height. Results indicated that placement of a pipe in a trench was of much greater importance than shaping the bedding. The 60° concrete bedding failed most dramatically. The polystyrene plank bedding showed some promise.

Soil stresses acting at the periphery and displacements at the intrados were measured in each zone at intervals of embankment depth. Revisions recommended for California culvert design specifications include the use of 2 bands of loading, with the actual embankment density acting vertically, and 30% and 100% of that density acting laterally.

AB - A yield criterion for reinforced concrete slabs is expressed considering the equality of the normal applied and ultimate resisting moments at the yield line. All orientations of the yield line at the point in question are examined. Experiments on small-scale reinforced concrete slabs are described. The experimental results provide support for the aforementioned yield criterion. Effect of kinking of the steel reinforcements across the yield line and the effect of change of the moment arm with the rotation of the yield line are examined.

AB - Strain reversal is taken into account in terms of generalized stress and generalized strain. The stiffness matrix is so derived that it is applicable to any piecewise elastic regime in the elastic-plastic deformation of a member, the effect of the axial force being taken into account by means of approximate stability functions. Numerical computation for the smallest critical load can be executed by following the standard matrix procedure for calculating eigenvalues. The proposed analysis facilitates the study of not only the stability limit, but also those states beyond and remote from this point. The proposed analysis can be applied to the practical design of such structures and is demonstrated in detail by means of simple numerical examples. A comparison of the result with that obtained by means of the exact stability functions is made and found to be in good agreement. The influence of unloaded plastic hinges on the ultimate load is illustrated.

AB - A finite element procedure for determining the critical buckling load for three-dimensional structures idealized by planar two-dimensional elements is presented. This procedure is applicable to structures whose instabilities involve small displacements and elastic behavior, i.e., linear elastic buckling. Local and overall structural instabilities may be treated together with complex loading and support conditions. The smallest eigenvalue corresponding to the smallest buckling load is determined by an inverse iteration procedure. The accuracy of this finite element procedure is evaluated by comparison with a number of problems for which classical solutions are available. A simply supported wide-flange beam with a stiffener, lateral restraints, and various rotational restraints is presented to illustrate the versatility of the procedure as well as the effect of the restraints on the buckling load. In addition, a comparison between the subject procedure and recent experimental results on a continuous wide-flange beam is presented.

AB - The inelastic response of reinforced concrete multistory frames was investigated by subjecting small-scale one-bay three-story reinforced concrete frames to a series of strong base motions simulating one horizontal component of representative earthquake acceleration records. The test results were evaluated from the perspective of analytical methods routinely and economically available to structural-design office: linear dynamic response analysis and static limit analysis based on elasto-plastic response. Linear dynamic analyses provided a good qualitative understanding of the observed inelastic behavior. The observed maximum base shears and overturning moments were much higher than the values predicted by the limit analysis due to strain-hardening of the steel. It is concluded that strain-hardening characteristics of the reinforcing steel must be explicitly considered in the earthquake-resistant design of reinforced concrete structures, especially in relation to design of web reinforcement, foundations, and columns.
