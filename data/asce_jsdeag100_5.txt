AB - On the basis of 299 tests on plate girders, reported in the literature, some very simple formulas are given for the prediction of the ultimate static strength under pure shear, pure bending, and combined shear and bending, and of the web crippling load in case of very thin webs. The agreement between calculation and measurement is sufficient for average design purposes. All formulas can be evaluated using only a slide rule.

AB - Optimization of topology, geometry, and cross-sectional properties from a discrete table of sections employing code allowable stresses is demonstrated on plane truss structures. A modified Complex Method of box for nonlinear constrained optimization is employed. The method does not require linearizing approximations or computation of derivatives. It is general in nature and can be applied to a variety of optimization problems. The computer program can be easily modified for space trusses or frame structures; for any table of cross sections; and to employ any code to calculate allowable stresses.

AB - Analyses are presented for predicting the cracking and ultimate strengths of prestressed concrete beams subjected to torsion. The experimental cracking strengths of 177 specimens are compared to the theoretical values and the experimental ultimate strengths of 348 specimens are compared to the theoretical values. Agreement is good, especially considering the many different types of sections analyzed. In the ultimate strength analysis, a torsion mode failure and a bending mode failure are considered. In the analysis of a torsion mode failure of a beam with stirrups, two types of beams are defined, i.e., completely underreinforced beams and beams that are underreinforced transversely but not longitudinally. To define these two types of beams, limits on the amount of reinforcement applicable to each type are determined empirically.

AB - Specimens of paste, mortar, and concrete were tested to failure when subjected to different amounts of lateral confining pressure. Two distinct modes of behavior were observed. Under low confining pressures, failure was accompanied by splitting, by large axial compressive and lateral tensile strains, significant internal microcracking and by a reduction in pulse velocity. For high lateral pressures, the axial strains at failure were smaller, lateral strains were compressive, and very little cracking and reduction in pulse velocity occurred at failure. This transition in behavior is explained in terms of the relative values of maximum deviatoric and hydrostatic components of failure stress, and the strengths of porous matrix and sliding interfaces. A stress-strain relationship includes two basic material constraints: bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio. These material properties are considered functions of invariants of stresses; the appropriate functions are derived from test results.

AB - Both bending and torsion generally occur, which cannot be solved together. The approach is based independently as they are coupled on the exact solution of differential equations of bending and of torsion for all intervals in which the length of the girder is divided. Boundary conditions at the ends of the structure and at the connections of intervals are formulated and constants of general solutions are found. Diaphragms may be deformable, made in plate or truss bracing form and they are assumed to be connected to the box girder at their corners. Forces of interaction between diaphragm and box girder are calculated as well as the resulting internal forces and moments in the box girder due to bending, torsion, and distortion effects.

AB - Reported are test results of 32 rectangular prestressed, with and without eccentricity, concrete beams under various combinations of torsion, bending, and shear. The general behavior, torsional and flexural stiffness, and ductility of the beams are examined. The ultimate strength and interactions between torque-moment and torque-shear are presented in nondimensional form. Circular and linear relationships are proposed, respectively, for torque-moment and torque-shear interactions. Compared with the test results of other investigators, it was noted that the presence of shear reduced the ultimate torsional capacity of the beams by 10 to 20%. Further, the torsional capacity was increased with decreasing shear span-depth ratio. The flexure and shear capacities of the beams were not affected in the presence of torsion up to 50% of the pure torsion capacity.

AB - A numerical method is described for the determination of the critical lengths of homogeneous steel beam columns, the critical length being defined as the length for which the applied axial force becomes the maximum force the member can sustain. In this method, prediction is made of the distribution of the bending moments along the compression members by the use of analytical expressions which describe their slopes. To obtain these analytical expressions, the moment-curvature-thrust relationships of the cross section must be represented by algebraic functions in which the curvatures are expressed explicitly in terms of the moments. The method is general and can be used whenever the moment-curvature-thrust relationships are available. Several examples of columns under the action of end-moments and symmetrical lateral loads have been solved by the proposed approach and comparison with available solutions has shown excellent agreement.

AB - A method is presented for computing the nonlinear dynamic response of planar cable-stiffened structures. The nonlinear dynamic equations are reduced to a smaller system by expanding the unknown variables as a series of mode shapes which were found by an eigenvalue analysis of the linear dynamic equations. The method is applied to two types of cable-stayed bridges. Results are presented for the static, linear dynamic, and nonlinear dynamic responses of these structures. The effect of damping is also indicated in the computations. It is found that for the structures under investigation a linear dynamic analysis is suitable.

AB - In designing lower strength steel structures (up to 50 ksi [345 N/mm²] yield strength) subject to low temperatures (down to -60°F [220°K]) information is needed to help define the fracture load of any member with a given crack as a function of temperature. Based on the basic assumption that even after inspection cracks of finite size will exist in a welded structure, an experimental procedure is presented by which the designer can estimate the fracture load of the member. The need for this procedure is apparent from the inadequacies or inapplicability of impact studies and linear elastic fracture mechanics for the grades of steels and range of temperatures of concern. The proposed procedure is substantiated by the results of a previous experimental study. It is shown to be consistent, discriminative, and rational.

AB - Investigations on the collapse load of reinforced concrete footings subject to central or eccentric loads are presented. Limit analysis solutions are developed for several limiting distributions of contact pressure and the influence of contact pressure distribution on the collapse load is brought out. Results of experimental investigations on square footings resting on sand, clay, or rigid base are presented together with some typical distributions of contact pressure measured at the failure of the footings. On the basis of theoretical collapse load from limit analysis and soil failure load from bearing capacity theory, an interpolation technique is suggested to predict the collapse loads for eccentrically loaded footings on soil. Collapse load curve of eccentrically loaded footing on rigid base is shown to follow the theoretical collapse load curve and the punching failure curve.

The out-of-plane stiffness of the floor side is taken into account by means of connecting beams. The problem is described in terms of three generalized displacement functions of the structure. No restriction is placed on the complexity of the floor plan layout. An example is worked out to show the importance of floor slab stiffness and comparisons are made with the results based on the finite element approach.

AB - The paper outlines a general procedure to predict the dynamic response, including resonance of hyperbolic cooling towers to turbulent winds. Pressure spectra on the tower surface were measured in a boundary layer wind tunnel. Simplifying assumptions have led to the description of pressure spectra and response spectra by means of compact formulation. Application to full-scale towers, including Ferrybridge, is examined. It is concluded that the windward and wake regions are not correlated; the quasi-steady response resides mainly in the coupled harmonics m=1, 2, 3; and the resonant response resides mainly in the harmonics m=4, 5, 6. It is also concluded that while the quasi-steady response increases as wind velocity squared, the resonant response increases faster than wind velocity cubed.

AB - A membrane analogy is given for free vibration analysis of rectangular orthogonal and nonorthogonal, isotropic/anisotropic networks using energy formulation. The analogy is applicable for all modes, except those when all joints become node points and modes are unsymmetric. In that case, frequencies are determined from the frequencies of the cable. The proposed theory is evaluated by comparing results of the finite element analysis of cable networks with those of the proposed membrane. The results are also compared with earlier theories. It is observed that the proposed theory is based on rational approach and gives better results.

AB - A rational approach to the modeling of reinforced concrete finite elements for plane stress applications is presented. Both the nonhomogeneity and anisotropy due to the reinforcement and the effect of tension cracks in the concrete are considered. It is assumed that the reinforced concrete is an elastic material and the strain energy of the body exists only for the uncracked portion of the concrete and the steel embedded in the body. Since initially the extent of cracking in the concrete body is not known, an iterative solution scheme is employed. The general formulation of the procedure is outlined and a detailed development for both a constant strain triangular element and an arbitrarily reinforced rectangular element with a linear edge displacement variation is presented. A variation of the initial stress procedure is followed to predict the extent and location of the tension cracks. Several applications are included using the nonconstant strain rectangular element in order to confirm the validity of the method.

AB - The continuous connection technique is now established as a quick and accurate method for the analysis of uniform pierced shear walls, which are commonly used as the primary structural element for high-rise buildings. While the Hetenyi method has been used to account for the variable wall thickness of tall buildings, it has the disadvantage that a series of terms must be summed until convergence for each discontinuity. This note illustrates how a system of Macaulay's brackets may be used to incorporate directly the discontinuity effects in the general solution for uniformly distributed loads. An analysis of load distribution for pierced shear walls consisting of three segments of uniform thickness is presented.

AB - The cellular flat plate construction extends the advantages of flat slabs to roofs and floors of large spans. In the ultimate load design of such plates, the applicability of yield line theory has been studied. Two cellular plates are tested under uniform distributed loading. The first cellular plate model is tested as a one-way slab, simply supported on rollers at the two short sides. The second plate is supported on all four sides on rollers. This study shows that the yield line theory may be applied for the design of cellular flat plates by treating them as uniform slabs of the same overall dimension having a moment of resistance per unit width equal to the average moment of resistance of cellular plates. It also determined that for underreinforced cellular plates failure is gradual.
