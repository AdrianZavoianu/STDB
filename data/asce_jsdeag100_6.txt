AB - A numerical method is presented for predicting the post-buckling response of thin-walled continuous beams. The proposed method includes a numerical integration procedure in conjunction with the flexibility matrix method of analysis. Nonlinearities due to local buckling and nonlinear material characteristics are accounted for by the nonlinear moment-curvature relations derived with the aid of the effective width concept. Using the moment distribution of an elastic prismatic beam based on the nonbuckling analysis, with an appropriate selection of the correction factor, the numerical iterative procedure converges rapidly. Typical beam sections and loading and support conditions are investigated. The difference between the computed moment distribution and that of an elastic prismatic beam is not appreciable for symmetrical sections with ordinary loading conditions. Simplified design methods with acceptable accuracy for predicting deflections in the post-buckling domain are developed.

AB - Frozen stress photoelastic model techniques were used to determine the validity of using a Vierendeel truss analysis for analyzing wide flange beams having off-center unreinforced rectangular openings in their webs. Excellent correlation exists between experimental results and theoretical calculations. Results of this analysis were used with the von Mises yield theory to obtain interaction curves for use in design of such structural members.

AB - It was determined in this research that a Portland cement concrete surface could be treated with methyl-methacrylate in monomer form and then polymerized in situ by natural sunlight. The penetration of the methyl-methacrylate was 0.4 in. nominally with about 50% of the initial loading being polymerized in the concrete surface. The following conclusions were made: (1) it is feasible to use methyl-methacrylate as a surface treatment for Portland cement concrete; (2) such treatment will not significantly increase the strength characteristics of the concrete; (3) such treatment will significantly reduce the amount of water absorbed through the surface of the concrete; (4) such treatment will improve the durability of the surface; and (5) such treatment will reduce the skid-resistance of the surface.

AB - The frequency response functions with or without hydrodynamic interaction, including or neglecting compressibility of water, and numerical results for the increase in periods of vibration of the dam due to water in the reservoir are presented. Also presented are responses of a typical concrete gravity dam, Pine Flat Dam, to Koyna 1967 and Taft 1952 ground motions. Hydrodynamic interaction as well as compressibility of water have very significant effects on the periods of vibration as well as frequency response functions of concrete gravity dams. A full reservoir causes a significant increase in the lateral displacements of the dam due to earthquake ground motion. Whether this increase in displacements is accompanied by an increase in the stresses or not depends on the frequency characteristics of the ground motion. Because of the hydrodynamic effects, the vertical component of ground motion is more important in the response of gravity dams in comparison with other classes of structures.

AB - The seismic response characteristics of the 11-story Charaima apartment building, which partially collapsed during the 1967 Venezuelan earthquake, are examined. The influences of higher modes, nonstructural partitions, soil-foundation interaction, slab stiffness, and ground motion characteristics on the dynamic response of the entire building were investigated assuming linear elastic behavior. More realistic inelastic analyses of the critical frame of the building were also conducted to investigate the effects of slab stiffness and ground-motion characteristics on the dynamic response. Both elastic and inelastic analyses identified failure mechanisms compatible with the actual damage to the building. The results clearly indicate that estimates of possible inelastic deformation based on elastic analyses can err significantly in magnitude and distribution. The investigation emphasizes the importance of explicitly accounting for both strength and ductility in design, analysis, and construction.

AB - Sandwich construction, when subjected to bending, experiences appreciable deflection due to transverse shear strains in the core. This paper presents a rectangular sandwich finite element. The bending and membrane stiffness matrices are derived by using the assumed-stress-distribution approach. Quadratic functions are assumed for the moments and linear functions for the transverse shear forces and edge displacements. At each corner node, three and two degrees-of-freedom are associated with bending and membrane actions, respectively. Full compatibility of displacements along interelement boundaries are insured even for cases where connected elements are not coplanar. The element is applicable to any three-dimensional structures made up of rectangular sandwich panels.

AB - An efficient computational method for predicting the moment variation along inelastic compression members is extended to deal with more general loading cases of laterally-loaded steel beam columns. In order to facilitate the analysis of such beam columns, it is necessary to develop one important feature which is a property of moment diagrams for compression members. It is shown that continuous moment diagrams exhibit symmetry about their maximums whether or not the maximums occur at the center of the column. Knowledge of this characteristic not only provides a systematic way for developing moment diagrams, but also increases the scope for their applications.

AB - Results are presented from tests and analyses of bolted connections in half-hard type 301 stainless steel, butt weldments, and transverse and longitudinal fillet welded connections in quarter and half-hard type 301 stainless steel. Material thickness ranged from 0.021 to 0.62 in. (0.53 to 1.57 mm). Expressions are given for the average failure loads or stresses for the connections as a function of the appropriate material properties and geometric parameters. These failure loads or stresses can be reduced by appropriate safety factors to arrive at allowable design stresses for connections in cold rolled stainless steel. The welded specimen test results indicate that the use of annealed material yield strength values for the design of welded connections in cold rolled stainless steel is overly conservative.

AB - Rectilinear plane and space frame with elastic connections occur in building frames; and with diagonal bracings, they also occur in scaffolding. The matrix stiffness analysis of the general space frame is developed for linear elastic connections related to every possible displacement at the end of each member. Correction matrices are also derived for modifying the usual rigid joint analysis. Examples are given of the elastic analysis of a plane framework and a simple space portal allowing for various elastic connections at the ends of some or all of the members.

Influence line ordinates for beams having up to four spans can be hand calculated. The procedure requires the inversion of a matrix of order equal to the number of interior supports.
