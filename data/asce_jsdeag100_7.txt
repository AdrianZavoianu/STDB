AB - Fracture toughness Kc values were determined for structural steels in thickness and at loading rates and temperatures representative of service conditions for many civil structures, with particular interest centered on bridges. The measurements were made using notched-bend tests with specimens 3-in. deep, 12-in. long, the full plate thickness, and with notches fatigue precracked to a depth of 1 in. The Kc values were computed using the observed maximum load and a crack size plasticity adjustment. A cushioned drop-weight loading technique provided loading times of 0.5 x 10-³ sec to 2 x 10-³ sec. Strain gages on the loading tup of the free-falling weight permitted load-time recordings for the tests. The limitation on useful Kc determinations due to specimen size was approximately 1.25 (in.)1,2 in. times the applicable yield strength of the steel. The test results presented are for temperatures ranging from –120° to 60°F and include, for comparison, results obtained with loading times of 1 – 3 sec.

AB - Fractiles of office building live load effects deduced from a combination of recent statistical data and probabilistic models are compared with popular code recommendations for design loads and areal reduction factors. The effects of loaded area, shape of influence surface, and division into independently acting tenants are studied systematically. The conventional definition of tributary area is not the most satisfactory one available. Several alternative forms of code presentation of design loads are compared, including a naive but accurate probabilistic model.

AB - A probability-based structural design method is introduced. The reliability criterion is replaced by a deterministic design equation, in which all random variables are substituted by appropriate design values. A design value depends upon: (1) the mean value and standard deviation of the corresponding random variable; (2) the reliability factor that reflects the acquired level of reliability; and (3) the sensitivity factor that measures the effect of the individual random variable upon the total system. Methods of application are considered.

AB - The live load behavior of curved girder bridge systems has been predicted by various analytical techniques. These techniques, however, are generally limited to radially-supported bridges with constant elevation. However, many curved bridges have: (1) skew supports; and (2) elevated supports. The influence of these effects relative to the radial and constant elevation support bridges has therefore been examined. The results are presented in tables and charts for use by the designer. A typical design example is also presented.

AB - The interaction of bending and torsion in laterally unsupported beams of I or WF sections was studied and the results were presented in a series of curves for practical use. The beams were subjected to vertical loads applied at the top flange and parallel to the major axis with a constant eccentricity, e, from the major axis. The cases studied were: (1) simply supported beams with a concentrated load at midspan; (2) simply supported beams uniformly loaded; (3) cantilever beams uniformly loaded; and (4) cantilever beams with a concentrated load at the free end. An example of application of the curves presented is shown.

AB - A approximate analysis of rigid frames using a new concept, called the stiffness center, is presented. It has been shown that when a skeletal elastic system is idealized as a configuration of elastic springs, about such a center the stiffness of the system is balanced. The concept of elastic center in closed-ring types of structures, the instantaneous center of rotation in a group of fasteners, the center of gravity in the cantilever method, the neutral axis in solid as well as in composite cross sections are all special interpretations of the stiffness center. The method is compared with the existing approximate methods.

AB - An inelastic dynamic analysis method was developed for reinforced concrete frame structures. The analytical model was able to account for stiffness characteristics related to cracking of the concrete, yielding and strain hardening of the reinforcement, bond slip of tensile reinforcement in a joint core, and stiffness degradation due to load reversals. The location of point of contraflexure in a member was taken into consideration to account for the distribution of inelastic deformation. The analysis method was tested by comparing calculated response waveforms with observed response waveforms of a small-scale three-story one-bay reinforced concrete frame structure, which was subjected to an intense base motion on the University of Illinois Earthquake Simulator. The observed waveforms at large amplitudes were favorably simulated by the analytical model based on the material properties and geometry of the test structure.

AB - A general curvature expression for beams and frames subjected to arbitrary rotations is developed and employed in the matrix displacement method of analysis. This formulation is compared with three other formulations utilizing: (1) linear curvature; (2) nonlinear curvature as used in elementary mechanics; and (3) small strain large displacement curvature. This study shows that for moderate rotations the formulation utilizing linear curvature is a reasonable approximation of the more sophisticated nonlinear expression.

AB - In this method polynomials are assumed in terms of the dimensions of a general triangle to form an element stiffness matrix. To begin with, the number of coefficients in these functions is reduced by considering the geometric and static properties of a triangle. A particular plate solution is then used to evaluate the remaining coefficients in the element stiffness matrix. The resulting explicit matrix can be represented as two submatrices of numerical coefficients. A considerable amount of computer time (about 90%) is saved by using this explicit matrix, compared with the usual procedure. Results obtained from the analysis of simple plate problems were satisfactory. This method of deriving the stiffness matrix is quite general and can therefore be applied to any type of finite element.

AB - This paper presents a set of concepts to systematize the structural design of tall buildings: (1) the decomposition of the structural system into subsystems; (2) the identification of key overall characteristics of these subsystems; (3) the use of these key parameters to analyze the systems; and (4) the manipulation of these parameters to optimize the system design. These four concepts may be used separately or in combination to simplify and systematize the design of multistory structures. They are approximate techniques and are intended for the selection of structural form and as a guide for more detailed design. A fifth concept concerns the use of a criterion for the initial selection of structural form. This provides a starting point for the analysis and manipulation of the preceding.

AB - For dynamic soil-structure interaction problems, the soil resistance is often represented through a combination of springs and dashpots that assumes the soil is homogeneous. Often, however, the supporting medium is inhomogeneous, comprising layers of varying strengths and stiffness. An approximate method is presented to determine stiffness coefficients for layered media. The basic assumption made in the analysis is that the stress distribution in a given layer is a function only of the distribution of the applied load and is independent of the relative stiffness of the other layers. Therefore, all the layers can be determined by assuming that the material in one layer is identical to that in the other levels and the stiffness coefficients are computed accordingly.
