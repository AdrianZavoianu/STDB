AB - Available methods of analysis (1973) are discussed in Section 5.2 and contrasted in Section 5.3 with the current understanding of the mechanisms of failure and the limitations imposed on those mechanisms by general principles governing the behavior of slabs. Section 5.4 deals with major factors affecting the shear strength and behavior of normal-weight, perforated and prestressed concrete slabs without shear reinforcements while Section 5.6 deals with the analyses, strength, and behavior of slab-column connections transferring moment as well as shear. Sections 5.7 and 5.8 examine the limitations of customary slab-column test specimens and the correlation between slab-column test results and slab system test results. Section 5.9 summarizes the findings of interest to designers. One hundred and two references are listed.

AB - Experimentally determined time-smoothed wind pressure distributions on a rigid model of a circular concave roof are presented. The loadings are then used in an analytical investigation of the static response of a cable network. It is observed that the flow separates from the leading edge of the structure and may or may not reattach, depending on the height-to-diameter ratio of the building and on the relative boundary layer thickness. Also, ground roughness has a significant effect on the velocity profile of the approaching flow and on the resulting pressure distribution. For a circular concave cable roof subjected to the experimentally determined asymmetric wind loading, nonlinear effects are important in determining the load-deformation behavior. As the magnitude of the loading increases, nonlinear effects become more pronounced.

AB - A subassemblage for use in the calculation of collapse loads for tall unbraced frames is described, and its features investigated. The subassemblage consists of one or more stories of the building. At the uppermost and lowermost floors of the subassemblage, only one-half of each beam is assumed to contribute to the subassemblage strength and stiffness. The loading and support conditions for the subassemblage closely simulate the boundary conditions present in the actual structure. The PΔ effect, the effects of hinge formation within the span of any beam, panel zone deformations, and column shortening effects may be taken into account. A computer program to calculate subassemblage behavior up to and beyond the ultimate load has been developed. The paper includes a detailed analysis of the PΔ effect.

AB - The design of prestressed cable trusses using a nonlinear computer analysis is investigated. An approximate method is used to select a trial design. Both concave and convex trusses with rigid and flexible supports are examined; symmetrical and unsymmetrical loads are considered. Other parameters investigated are cable rise and sag, area of top and bottom cable, initial prestress force, and number and pattern of web members. The results are compared to approximate solutions where possible.

AB - Load displacement relationships of large plane multistory steel rigid frames have not been investigated extensively. A numerical technique for the elasticplastic analysis of rigid frames was developed and programmed. The obtained computer program was used to analyze five 10-story, two-bay and five 32-story, three-bay frames which had been designed for realistic office building loading in accordance with current allowable stress design procedures. The analyses, which accounted for the effects of joint displacements, spreading of yielded zones, and residual cooling stresses, showed that frames became unstable before the formation of a mechanism and that frame stability was mainly a function of frame girders rather than columns. For these frames use of Julian-Lawrence Alignment Chart for column design was shown not to offer any advantages over the use of K=one, while the assumption regarding fixity at the base was shown to be an important design consideration.

AB - A rational, simple method is presented for analysis of the torsion-bending-shear interaction at failure for reinforced concrete beams. Equilibrium equations are studied for observed failure mechanisms. Three mechanisms can occur depending on where the concrete compression zone is formed: in the top (mode t), in the bottom (mode b), or in one vertical side (mode s). In modes t and b, the torsion-bending and the shear-bending interaction are governed by second-degree parabolas, whereas the torsion-shear interaction is governed by an ellipse. In mode s, the interaction surface is a cylinder with an elliptic base in the torsion-shear plane. The interaction in this mode is not influenced by the value of the bending moment, M. Approximations regarding the lengths of the moment lever arms and regarding the shear-carrying capacity are examined. Some test results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the method. The main feature of the method is that the vertical shear forces are considered in a simple but rational way.

AB - The flexibility method for structural analysis requires the inversion of the structural flexibility matrix. The accuracy of the inversion in a computer solution is affected by the error generated by computational round-off. Several general and related guidelines have been suggested as to how the final form of the matrix to be inverted should appear. Following these guidelines an algorithm is developed to minimize the number of off-diagonal terms and maximize the magnitude of the diagonal terms by appropriately selecting the redundants using only the associated topology.

AB - Although the problem of large forces acting over limited contact areas of concrete is often encountered in engineering design, a theoretical rendering of the behavior and ultimate bearing strength of concrete is extremely difficult because of the overall complexity of the problem. Experimental studies are, therefore, imperative. The bearing strength of concrete is affected by several diverse factors. In this paper, the nature of bed (rigid or yielding) supporting the specimen, supported area of specimen, concrete properties, and size of specimen are considered as the principal variables, and their effect on the bearing strength ratio, i.e., the ration of ultimate local bearing stress to the concrete cube strength is presented on the basis of comprehensive tests.

AB - Recent failures suggest a reexamination should be made of the codes for wind loading on buildings. The 1972 Building Code requirements for minimum design loads in buildings and other structures as published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) prescribe an average external pressure coefficient of 0.8 on windward walls, –0.6 on leeward walls, and –0.7 on side walls. Recent experimental work suggests that the average and local pressure coefficients prescribed by the code may be inadequate if the wind is turbulent and approaches the building at a small angle of attack. A series of pressure distribution measurements on rectangular rods in a cross flow was taken with the rods oriented at small angles with respect to the wind direction. The results reveal that the most critical pressures on the side walls occur with angles of attack between 6 and 10°. Furthermore, these measurements yield values of external pressure coefficients that are much more severe than indicated by the building code. These results suggest a weakness of the ANSI Building Code.

AB - The problems associated with rail as it interacts with the aerial structure and special trackwork have been further complicated in recent years by the use of continuous welded rail and direct fixation of the track to the concrete structure. The engineering consulting firm of De Leuw, Cather and Co. develops a method of designing continuous welded rail for placement on aerial structures. To handle the high stress produced by continuous welded rail the continuous turnout unit is developed. The use of continuous turnout units should reduce maintenance needs and noise levels.
