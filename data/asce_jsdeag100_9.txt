AB - Principal probability concepts are presented and developed for the proper modeling and analysis of uncertainty, and for evaluating the associated effects on safety and design. Under conditions of uncertainty, safety and serviceability of structures can be assured only in terms of the probability of survival (or conversely of failure); accordingly, the level of safety is expressed explicitly as a function of the degree of uncertainty. The assumptions necessary to implement probability concepts in the development of practical design criteria and code provisions are explained and delineated. Uncertainty (including uncertainty associated with errors in estimation and imperfection in mathematical models) is expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation; in this term, its effect on safety and design can be assessed systematically and logically through first-order statistical analysis. Specific proposals for evaluating safety level and for developing safety and load factors for design are developed.

AB - The development of risk-based structural design criteria is described. The analysis of design uncertainties arising from the statistical nature of some variables and incomplete information regarding others is examined. The risk of unfavorable performance commensurate with the level of uncertainty is shown to provide a consistent measure of design safety and thus furnish a systematic means for comparing design alternatives. Current design provisions for reinforced concrete beams are appraised in terms of their underlying uncertainties and risks. It is shown that practical risk-based design criteria can be prescribed without unreasonable increase in design code complexity.

AB - First-order probabilistic selection of safety factors is illustrated with practical examples of design of reinforced concrete beams, structural steel columns, and cold-formed steel beam elements. The example on deflection in concrete beams indicates how performance criteria can be formulated using the proposed design methods. The examples also show that it is possible to reconcile design methods by proper selection of code parameters and to calibrate design in one technology against another.

AB - A description is presented for extending reliability analysis concepts from structural elements to structural systems. The aim is to develop techniques for calculating the reliability or probability of failure of complete structures. From a practical design standpoint one solution analyzed is the determination of partial safety factors. These are quantities by which the element safety factor should be changed to account for its presence in a structural assemblage so that the overall failure probability remains roughly equal to what is desired for the element. Consequences of failure must also be considered. Fundamental models of structural reliability of systems are described including determinate structures (weakest-link), indeterminate structures (fail-safe), and brittle members. Examples of solutions for reliability analysis and design are presented.

AB - This paper describes that portion of the current effort by the researchers interested in structural dynamics which has direct bearing on the safety analysis from the viewpoint of a probabilistic approach. Otherwise, the entire field of research dealing with structural dynamics has to be reviewed since any research effort in this field is or is supposed to be done for the ultimate goal of attaining a better understanding of structural behavior in reference to its safety. In what follows, a particular emphasis is place upon the safety analysis of those structures subject to natural forces, e.g., strong-motion earthquakes, stormy winds, and severe wind-induced waves.

AB - At present, the fatigue provision in most design specifications in this country is based upon test data presented in the form of modified Goodman diagrams. The recent AISC specification is based upon a constant-range criterion. In any event, neither the randomness of fatigue lives nor that of applied loads is being considered. In this paper, a simple and reliability-based procedure is presented for the fatigue design of structures. The probability distribution for repeated loads can be obtained from dynamic analysis or field measurements. In addition, the stress-life-probability relations are available from single-stress-level laboratory tests. With an initial configuration of the structure, the distribution of repeated stresses can be computed. Then, the life of the structure can be predicted using a cumulative-damage criterion and an acceptable probability of failure. The computed life is compared with the design life, and the design can be modified in an iterative manner.

AB - An automated procedure for the preliminary plastic design of tall steel buildings is presented. The procedure is based on linear programming to minimize the beam weights, followed by selection of column sizes to provide a strong column-weak beam design. The procedure is computer oriented, but in one of its variations can be applied quite easily by hand. Several parameters may be selected by the designer, permitting him to exercise substantial control over the design procedure and to produce a variety of different designs for any given structure. Constraints to limit the lateral drift under working load may be included if desired. The assumptions and limitations of the procedure are listed, and the equations on which it is based are presented. A series of seven different designs for a typical frame are reviewed and compared with designs obtained for the same frame by other workers.

AB - Plane elements based on assumed displacement fields are reviewed. A plane element based on the assumed-stress hybrid principle is found to model bending action as well as any of the displacement-based elements. Contrary to many displacement-based elements, the hybrid is valid for arbitrary quadrilateral shape. A modification is introduced to remove the orientation-dependence of the element and improve its stress prediction. The element formulation is detailed so that it may be easily adopted by interested users. Numerical examples suggest that among plane quadrilaterals having four nodes and eight degrees-of-freedom, the modified hybrid is the most effective element currently available.

AB - Four two-span continuous beams loaded at their midspan by equal concentrated loads were tested to failure. The inelastic hinge rotation seems to be slightly reduced by the increase in the degree of prestressing as represented by the ratio of the prestressing steel reinforcement index, while flexural rigidity and cracking characteristics under service loads are clearly improved. A method is suggested for calculating the total inelastic hinge rotation. Test results illustrate the beneficial effect of incorporating nonprestressed steel on ductility of prestressed flexural members.

AB - Current methods for determining dynamic alongwind response are based on the assumption that turbulence spectra are independent of height. The adequacy of this assumption is assessed in the light of recent theoretical and experimental results of boundary layer meteorology. Expressions for the alongwind response, including deflections and accelerations, are proposed. It is shown that, in the case of tall, flexible, lightly damped structures (i.e., of structures for which the resonant response, as defined by Davenport and Vickery, is high), expressions of the spectrum which reflect its dependence upon height yield lower values of the alongwind fluctuating response than the expression currently used in building codes and standards in which this dependence is ignored. Results of numerical calculations show that the values of the fluctuating deflections and of the gust factors obtained if the latter expression is used may be higher by as much as 50 and 25%, respectively, than those obtained if the variation of spectra with height is taken into account.

AB - A finite element analysis to determine time-dependent deflections of reinforced concrete slabs, including the effects of cracking, creep, and shrinkage, is presented. The analysis employs a 16-degree-of-freedom layered rectangular plate bending element, and uses a numerical time integration scheme to evaluate creep and shrinkage strains determined from CEB parameters. The initial strain technique is used in the solution procedure. Predicted results are compared with the limited experimental results in the literature.

AB - The imposed rotation method for the inelastic analysis of frames rests on the interpretation of the actual bending moment distribution as the superposition of linear elastic moment responses to loads and to unknown plastic rotations regarded as imposed strains. The method given herein is a generalized formulation, covering second-order geometric effects and moment-axial force interaction. Finite element models of frames and piecewise linear moment-rotation laws for critical sections are assumed. Recent algorithms for solving quadratic programming and linear complementarity problems are shown to be efficiently applicable to the analysis of multistory frames. The safety factor with respect to local failure because of brittle flexural behavior turns out to be attainable by a suitably modified linear programming procedure.

AB - The effects of continuity on torsional-flexural buckling have been studied. In 1953, an approximate treatment by Salvadori proposed calculating the critical load for each component under the correct loading and minimum restraint conditions, the lowest value then being a lower bound on the frame's buckling load. This note suggests that, where normal bracing is provided, sufficiently accurate torsional-flexural buckling loads may be obtained for a modification of this early approach. Following normal finite element procedures, each member in the frame is divided into a number of line-elements joined only at the nodes. The stiffness matrix for the structure is then assembled from the stiffness matrices of all the elements. A numerical study shows that the careful use of results for isolated members leads to acceptable estimates of the frame buckling loads.

AB - This note presents an analysis by which the cracking strength may be evaluated independent of the location of the critical section. The approach is essentially statistical. The diagonal cracking load is a function of the following variables: 1) the total diagonal cracking load on the beam; 2) the effective depth of the beam; 3) length of span; 4) width of beam; and 5) tensile reinforcement. The analysis suggests that the reinforced concrete beams under uniform load exhibit the same behavior up to diagonal cracking.

AB - Recent study in the field of optimum design of frame and truss-type structures has shown that changes in geometry can have a pronounced effect on weight reduction. This technical note presents a simple approximate reanalysis technique for variable configuration. The technique is based on the mixed method of analysis in which the fundamental unknowns consist of both member forces and joint displacements. To test and evaluate this technique, a large number of space truss problems were solved, and the results for a typical problem are presented. The examples demonstrated the high accuracy of the predictions of the proposed reanalysis technique.
