AB - The United States is faced with the tremendous task of replacing and upgrading bridge structures on the secondary and county highway systems. Properly designed and constructed timber bridges offer one possible solution to this problem. Recognizing the fact that many engineers are unfamiliar with timber design, a comprehensive reference list of design literature on timber highway bridges has been compiled. For each referenced document, a brief abstract is provided to aid the designer in selecting appropriate reference information for a specific timber bridge design problem. With the increasing awareness by the engineering profession of the need to place greater emphasis on both energy and resource conservation in the selection of construction materials, timber has taken on renewed importance as a basic structural material for the design and construction of highway bridges. It requires less energy to process timber to a usable construction material than other conventional structural materials and timber is our only naturally renewable construction material resources.

AB - A Fourier spectra analysis of the recorded February 9, 1971, San Fernando earthquake response of 12 southern California high-rise buildings was conducted and damping in building normal modes of vibration was estimated. Obtained damping values were correlated with building basement 0% damped pseudovelocity response spectrum and empirical equations were derived for damping estimation. A procedure utilizing these equations was developed for the selection of damping values for use in building design.

AB - Low-Temperature (−30? F or colder) impulse (impact) tests were performed on six simulated bridge girders after they had been previously subjected to room-temperature cyclic loading corresponding to the AASHO allowable fatique stress. All girders contained cover-plate-end details; three were of A36 steel and three were of A572 Grade 50 steel. The fracture stress for simulated bridge members containing the most critical common structural detail was determined for the worst combination of temperature, strain rate, and prior fatigue loading. In the impulse tests, the specimens were able to reach nominal bending stresses close to the specified minimum yield point of the steel even though they contained severe fatigue cracks that would have caused a fatigue failure in a relatively short time in service. The simulated bridge members had sufficient fracture toughness to prevent premature failure in service.

AB - Values of natural frequencies and critical damping ratios are estimated for eight tall structures from statistical analysis of their ambient accelerograms. These structures include six reinforced concrete buildings, one steel building, and one steel flagpole. Frequencies are computed from spectral density estimates and damping from autocorrelograms of filtered data. At least four frequencies are estimated for each of the seven buildings. Damping percentages calculated range from 0.4% to 2.9% of critical. A comparison is also made for one of the buildings of its computed response parameters with results obtained from an independent investigation.

AB - An analysis to predict the yield strength of corners in cold-formed steel structural members was presented by Karren in 1967. It is based on plastic theory, using isotropic power-law strain hardening with von Mises' yield condition and plastic potential. The analysis and consequent design formulas are quite complicated. This paper presents an alterative elementary analysis; specific assumptions of isotropy, von Mises' yield condition, and isotropic power-law strain hardening has been relaxed. The solution is specialized for the case of linear strain hardening, leading a simple and perspicuous design formula. The proposed formula gives practically the same result as existing code procedures.

Three sample networks are analyzed and comparisions with the solutions obtained by the dynamic form of the displacement method of structural analysis are made. It is found that for many cable networks the modal response method is a satisfactory analysis procedure; however, there are structures for which its use will not lead to any efficient use of computer time.

AB - The effects of soil-structure interaction on the seismic response of simple structures are analyzed considering the foundation medium to behave as a linear viscoelastic solid. Two forms of viscoelastic action are investigated-the standard Voigt model and the constant hysteric model-and a procedure is recommended for interrelating the properties of the two models so that maximum deformation of the structure is approximately the same in the two cases. Comprehensive response spectra are presented for a range of the parameters defining the problem, and the results are used to access the accuracy of a simple approximate method of analysis in which the system is represented by a viscously damped simple oscillator. Simple expressions of high accuracy and numerical data are included for evaluating the characteristics of the replacement oscillator. It is shown that hysteretic action in the supporting medium may affect significantly the response of flexibly mounted structures.

AB - The influence of adhesive rigidity on the stress distribution in a prefabricated plywood wall panel subject to a racking load has been investigated. A typical low-cost housing wall panel, joined by means of a thick-layer adhesive, was studied analytically and experimentally. The results of stress analyses of the panel were performed with two different adhesive rigidities-a rigid adhesive and a relatively flexible adhesive. For each analysis, the stresses in the plane of the sheathing were compared. The analytically predicted critcal rolling shear stress between framing and sheathing was found to be three times greater in the panel joined by the rigid adhesive than in the panel joined by a flexible adhesive. The flexible adhesive serves to reduce stress concentrations by distributing loads uniformly throughout the structural system. The results of a limited testing program partially substantiate the results of the analytical study. A wall panel was fabricated and constructed with a material similar to a flexible thick-layer adhesive. The agreement was good which in part substantiates the conclusions drawn from the finite element analysis.

This system of coefficients is an efficient method of presentation of the influence surfaces for moments or deflections at any point on a particular slab due to an arbitrarily placed concentrated load. The load-distribution characteristic predicted by the theory is evaluated from available experimental results.

AB - A mathematical model is developed to study tornadic wind loading on tall buildings. Based on a theoretical solution, a wind field model is constructed, in which the variation of wind velocity within the tornado vortex boundary layer is considered. The dynamic wind loading and response of a tall building is investigated. A method of evaluating the probability of maximum response due to tornado is also presented. It is found that: (1) the inertia force component, usually neglected in conventional wind force formula, plays an important role; (2) Dynamic effect is important and the response level can be extremely high if the building is close to the tornado path; and (3) dynamic tornado effect dominates, as compared with ordinary winds, in the risk range where structural failure is of primary concern.

AB - Previous investigations of the effects of cold-forming on light gage steel have dealt primarily with so-called corners, where the effect of plastic straining is large and that of strain aging negligible. However, in cases where cold work is less severe, e.g. in cold-formed electric-welded tubing, the influence of strain aging becomes significant. A method for predicting increases in yield strength in members formed with moderate amounts of plastic deformation is presented. The results of this method are compared with experimental results.

AB - This paper develops an elastic-post elastic anlaysis for the response of reinforced plates of a tension-weak material such as concrete under small deflection theory limitations. The finite element displacement method of discretization is utilized, and a layered model is chosen to allow for different arrangements of reinforcing. As the load is progressively increased, cracking or crushing of the concrete layers and yielding of the steel layer can occur. New constitutive relations are derived to represent this behavior. Concrete is assumed to follow a maximum normal stress criterion in tension, and a von Mises criterion in compression. The steel is assumed to follow the von Mises criterion. Loading is applied incrementally as cracking and crushing occur progressively through the thickness and across the surface of the plate.

AB - Sixteen important controllable variables in the strength of conventional brick masonry are related in 10 equations for strength in compression, flexure, and shear. Axial compressive strength of standard brick masonry prisms is a function of the compressive strengths of brick and mortar and quality of workmanship. The compressive strength of brick is a function of unit size and shape, raw material, manufacturing process and degree of burning. Compressive strength of mortar is a function of cement, lime, water and air content, curing condition and batch life. Flexural strength of brick masonry is a function of brick-mortar bond, joint thickness, and mortar cement content. Bond strength of brick to mortar is a function of mortar flow, air content, and exposure time, and brick suction and surface condition. Shear strength of brick masonry is a function of brick-mortar bond strength, compressive stress and coefficient of internal friction.

Loading cases considered for the model included both gravity loading and longitudinal prestress. The in-plane and bending stresses resulting from these loading cases were obtained. The observed data were compared with a finite element analysis. Longitudinal moments are generally predictable using elementary beam theory. A two-dimensional finite element analysis is required for transverse moment prediction and support moment prediction. Close agreement was found between the observed and computed data.

AB - The buckling solutions, which were derived only for a pin-ended single-crossarm stayed column, were applied to a numerical example to demonstrate the influence of various stayed column parameters on the mode of instability and the buckling strength. The results indicated that the critical load associated with the symmetrical mode of instability (single curvature) was significantly altered by small changes in either the crossarm member length or the stay diameter. The results also indicated that very large strength increases can be expected when the crossarm members are rigidly connected to the column. The study substantiated the need for buckling solutions to predict the behavior and strength of multiple crossarm stayed columns where strength increases ranging from 20 to 45 times that of the unstayed column have already been experimentally achieved.

Theoretical methods are derived to predict the cracking and ultimate capacities of reinforced concrete L-beams containing symmetrically and unsymmetrically placed longitudinal steel with stirrups and subject to combined loading. The principal tensile stress criterion with the assumptions of plastic behavior for torsion and elastic behavior for flexure and transverse shear may be used to predict the cracking torque of a section. The provisions of the ACI Building Code and the National Building Code of Canada are conservative for predicting the ultimate capacity of L-beams and require numerous repetitive calculations to analyze a given section.

AB - The minimum weight optimum design of planar frame structures subject to frequency (or buckling) constraints, stress constraints, and member sizing constraints is covered by the finite element displacement method. Two design variables define the cross section of each planar frame element. The total number of design variables for a problem can be reduced by employing the design variable linking option. The mathematical programming problem is solved using a Sequence of Unconstrained Minimizations Technique (SUMT). In particular, the interior extended penalty function formulation is used in conjunction with the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell minimization algorithm. Potential difficulties in formulating the frequency (or buckling) constraints and gradients are reviewed. Results for small example problems are presented and evaluated. In addition, various recently developed structural synthesis approximation concepts which may be used to extend the approach to larger and more complex structural systems are mentioned.

AB - A method of analysis of the reliability for structures with resistance deterioration is developed. Random resistance of structures is assumed to deteriorate in proportion to the deterioration factor which is a function of the intensity of applied loads. In describing the survival of deteriorating structures, the nonfailure effect is also taken into consideration. Probability distribution of the residual resistance, failure rate, and reliability function for future loads are obtained for deteriorating structures with or without experiences of past loads of known intensities. Special cases of these results coincide with the classical reliability theory for repeated loads. Numerical results are obtained for the mean residual resistance, the failure rate, and the reliability function, from which it is concluded that the deterioration effect is important in the reliability theory for repeated loads and that the form of the deterioration factor has a great influence upon the analytical results.

Twelve tests, four static and eight dynamic, were conducted on slabs with totally fixed edges and a clear span of 29 in. (737 mm) and a thickness of 0.89 in. (22.6 mm). Two series of slabs (I and II) corresponding to two different percentages of steel reinforcement (0.78% and 1.17%) were used. The slabs were subjected to uniformly distributed static loads up to 36.5 psi (252 kN/m2) using water pressure and to dynamic airblast overpressures ranging from 26.5 psi (183 kN/m2) to 56.8 psi (392 mm kN/m2) using explosives. Measurements of pressure, deflection, and reinforcement strains were made, and results are presented herein. The primary mode of failure studied was the response of the slabs in the area beyond yield. This included the effects of tensile membrane action.
