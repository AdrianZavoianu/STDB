AB - An experimental study of the behavior of a model on an orthotropic steel bridge deck is reported. The orthotropic plate was acted upon by static repeated loads capable of stressing the structure beyond the elastic range. The tests performed showed alternate yielding in the ribs which were directly loaded, for a P value quite lower than the static collapse; the latter was found to be very high compared to the elastic limit, confirming a well-known fact. The behavior of the model tested is finally reproduced by means of two theoretical schemes: (1) For the lower values of P the loaded ribs were considered to be an elastic-plastic beam with strain hardening. This beam is considered to be continuous on elastic supports, i.e., on transverse beams. (2) for the higher values of P, up to collapse, the orthotropic plate was considered to be a rigid-plastic grid connected to an elastic-plastic membrane, i.e., the deck plate.

AB - Previous studies of the effectiveness of corrugated steel sheeting acting as shear diaphragms in stabilising slender I-beams have been reviewed in addition to the two criteria that govern the effectiveness of such bracing; diaphragm stiffness, which controls beam strength, and diaphragm strength have been identified. While an existing method of calculating the elastic critical moment of a diaphragm-braced beam is satisfactory, the calculations required in the subsequent check of the diaphragm strength are too involved for routine design. A new method, requiring far simpler calculations, has been derived. The whole process of beam and bracing design has then been cast in a form that is in keeping with accepted design methods for unbraced beams. Inspection of the bracing requirements of hot-rolled sections together with the results of shear tests on diaphragm assemblies suggests that in many cases lateral buckling will be prevented, in which case the beam may be designed elastically for its full in-plane capacity.

AB - This paper presents an application of state space optimization techniques to the optimal design of plane steel frames. AISC Code requirements are imposed, along with displacement, natural frequency, and member size constraints. A general structural design problem is defined and is then specialized to the case of plane frames. Results for three example problems are obtained with a computer program developed for the purpose. Results are compared with solutions available in the literature. New results are presented for cases in which multiple failure modes are imposed on the structure.

AB - A modified Rayleigh Ritz energy method is presented for the calculation of the critical load of a plate under complex loadings. The method is then used for the calculation of the critical load of a plate under partial edge loading, and also under bending and shear stresses. Calculations for the interaction curves have been carried out for aspect ratios from 1/3 to 2 and for partial edge ratios of 1/4 to 1 with respect to the shorter side. The plates are assumed to be simply supported on all sides. The results are presented in the form of interaction curves which show that the presence of the partial edge load reduces the interaction curve for the bending and shear stresses. The critical coefficients under positive bending or shear stress decrease in the presence of a partial edge load. However, for negative bending stress there is very little interaction with the partial edge load. It is also indicated how these curves can be utilized for the calculation of the critical strength of the web of a plate girder.

AB - A need exists for representation of the interlock strength of steel sheet piling as a distribution for two main reasons. First, this strength is highly variable, and second, this aspect of design of a sheet pile system depends on the strength of the weakest interlock. In this investigation a total of 220 interlock tension tests were run on PS28 steel sheet piling from two different sources. From these tests frequency distribution diagrams were developed. A considerable difference in the results demonstrated a sensitivity of one of the two products to initial alignment. The study of the failure mechanism further suggested that relative alignment angle of adjacent webs, not considered in this program, may have a considerable influence on interlock strength. Consequently, while this study provides for an improved concept of representation of interlock strength it demonstrates a possible need for improved testing techniques.

AB - A method is presented to analyze the behavior and evaluate the safety of a rib-type anchorage system used in attaching the steel liner plate to the concrete wall in a prestressed or reinforced concrete containment vessel. The method presented is consistent with that of Doyle and Chu and utilizes the stress fall-off concepts examined by Young and Tate. A mathematical model is defined, and the analysis procedure is developed in step-by-step fashion up to the final determination of anchor displacements and factor of safety. A computer program was written to perform the calculations described. The method, as presented and programmed, requires that the load-deflection curve be idealized as either bilinear or trilinear. One linear panel is assumed to be buckled. The initial deflection of this panel plus the thicknesses and yield strengths of this and other panels are then specified.

AB - The nonuniformity of creep and shrinkage caused by drying, and to a lesser extent by temperature gradients, causes significant self-straining in containment shells. This condition can be of two types: (1) Local, within the cross section of the wall, or (2) global, due to differences in the deformation of the cylindrical shell and foundation slab, or the dome, the ring, and the hoop tendon buttresses. By approximate calculations, in which cracking is neglected, these effects are shown to be quite significant as compared with other loads in service conditions, whose effect is also normally evaluated without consideration of cracking. For quantitative design predictions, the stress relief due to cracking must be considered. By means of a numerical example, it is demonstrated that the age-adjusted effective modulus method permits a very simple analysis of these effects.

AB - The analysis of mats as in nuclear power plants may become difficult when the large number of features are intended to be accounted for. Circular mats and arbitrary loadings are only a few of these that are considered in this paper. If the subgrade reaction can be represented as the function of subgrade displacement as given by Winkler's, Boussinesq's, or two elastic characteristic approaches, the general numerical method is then possible. Boussinesq's approach was treated in more detail when applied on circular mat with arbitrary loadings. Full polar grid formation that must be used when liftoff occurs is compared to harmonic formulation. The possibility of taking into account the superstructure restraint is indicated.

AB - Three 10-story three-bay structures having K-braced framing systems are designed for seismic loads according to building code requirements. Members are proportioned by standard allowable stress procedures. The frames are subjected to strong ground motion and the inelastic response of the three systems is evaluated and compared. Results show that increased ductility requirements occur in regions adjacent to discontinuities in lateral stiffness. The addition of an outrigger truss at the top of the frame tends to force more of the inelastic deformation into the girders and bracing rather than the columns. The fully braced systems are very effective in controlling lateral displacement.

AB - A finite difference procedure is used to determine the response of a single span curved single box beam bridge with any number of interior diaphragms. The bending and torsional distortions as well as cross-sectional distortions can then be determined throughout the curved box girder. The forces that are determined include bending moment and shear, pure torsion, warping torsion, and bimoment. These forces, in addition to distortional functions, yield resulting normal bending, normal warping, and normal distortional stresses. The technique is then used to determine the dead-load and live-load response of a series of typical curved box beams. A study of the data has resulted in a series of empirical design equations.

AB - An approximate displacement method for three-dimensional analysis of tall reinforced concrete buildings is described in Ref. 2. Floors, subsequently called nodal floors, are selected between which only minor changes in the formwork are to occur. Only nodal floors are described in the computer input. However, at every floor level constraints are imposed that permit columns and walls to be treated in the same general manner. A building stiffness matrix with a fraction of the natural degrees-of-freedom is assembled using one component matrix for each member-group of vertically adjacent similar members. For preliminary analysis, sufficient nodal floors are selected to model the major irregularities in stiffness; average member properties are used within each member-group. For final analysis, more detail and accuracy are obtained by adding nodal floors in the preliminary mathematical model. In the previous paper, natural modes and periods for approximate models are compared to those of the detailed model for which the building is idealized as a system of individual members. Herein, the results of approximate and detailed static analyses will be compared.
