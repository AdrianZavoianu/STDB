AB - The inelastic reserve strength of cold-formed steel beams whose compression flanges are stiffened a long both longitudinal edges by webs is the subject of this paper. On the basis of an experimental and analytical study, it has been shown that the inelastic reserve strength of cold-formed steel beams due to partial plastification of the cross section can be significant for many practical shapes. With proper care this reserve strength can be utilized to achieve more economical design of such members. Beams whose compression flanges are stiffened along both longitudinal edges by webs is the subject of this paper. Current work at Cornell University includes the extension of this study to beams with compression flanges, with unstiffened outer edges as well as the utilization of reserve strength due to inelastic moment redistribution.

AB - Theoretical numerical data are presented for: (1) The in-plane shear stiffness of corrugated plates with discrete attachments to framing members at the ends of the corrugations; and (2) the maximum transverse flexural strains due to the cross-sectional deformations that accompany the shearing of such plates. The corrugation cross section is curvilinear with crests and troughs composed of identical circular arcs. Four kinds of discrete attachments are considered at the ends of the corrugations, i.e.: (1) Point attachments in the troughs; (2) point attachments in the troughs and at the crests; (3) point attachments at midheight; and (4) point attachments in the troughs, at the crests, and at midheight. The material is taken to be linearly elastic and isotropic.

AB - A simplified method is presented for the analysis of framed-tube structures subjected to lateral loads. The rigidly jointed perimeter frame panels are replaced by equivalent orthotropic plates, whose properties are chosen to represent both the axial and shearing deformation characteristics of the frames. The force and stress distributions in the panels are assumed to be represented with sufficient accuracy by polynomial series in the horizontal coordinates, the coefficients of the series being functions of the height only. The unknown functions are determined from the principle of least work. The influence of stiffer corner columns is included in the analysis. Closed-form solutions are presented for three standard load cases, a uniformly and a triangularly distributed load, and a point load at the top. Design curves are presented to enable solutions to be obtained rapidly.

AB - A knowledge of the inherent problems associated with latticed structures, particularly those problems that are interrelated between office design and field execution, and the field remedial measures undertaken, can be of valuable assistance to the design profession and can result in a wider use of latticed structures. Four case histories of recently designed latticed structures are presented. The first section examines the planning of details and construction operations that resulted in economies and facilitated the construction of the Niagara Falls Convention Center in Niagara Falls, New York. The second section describes the design of the massive space frame sculpture for the Southeast Loop Park in Rochester, N. Y. The third section illustrates the adaptability of a latticed structure to various geometrical constraints, as applied to the RCA Management Conference Center in New York, N. Y. The fourth section looks at the field problems, investigations, remedial measures, and load testing of the space truss roof of a large sports complex.

AB - Natural frequencies and modes of vibration for suspension cables are determined using a discretized system composed of a linkage of straight bars connected by frictionless pins with concentrated masses at the connection points. The governing equations are linearized which limits the applicability to small oscillations. The frequencies are determined by a generalized Holzer method coupled with the solution of the associated boundary value problem as a set of initial-value problems. The method is applied to sample numerical problems and the results are compared with the results obtained by alternate approaches. The sensitivity of the results to the nature of the discretization is studied. Also, several parameter studies are conducted to determine how the natural vibrations are altered in response to dimensional variations in the suspension cable. The results of the parameter studies are summarized in a nondimensional form.

AB - The behavior of reinforced concrete beams in the range of behavior in which moment is decreasing while deformation continues to increase, the post-crushing range, was studied. Tests on six beams without compressive or transverse steel were reported. A theoretical model of the failure mechanism in the crushing zone was presented and theoretical rotations and deflections were computed based on that model. Theoretical values were compared with experimental results. Good correlation for deflections was obtained up to three times those corresponding to the maximum moment.

AB - The load-deformational response of beam-column joints in moment resisting steel frames subjected to severe lateral actions has been studied experimentally and analytically. The investigation showed that joints per se are elements with large energy dissipation capacity, exhibiting a high reserve strength beyond first yielding, large ductility, and stable hysteretic behavior. A tri-linear mathematical model is proposed for the joint response that compares well with the experimental results. Design recommendations are given based on strength and stiffness considerations. The effects of axial loads on the columns and shear stiffeners are investigated and included in the mathematical models and design recommendations. It is hoped that the results of the reported investigation will contribute to a better prediction of the static and dynamic characteristics of frames. These characteristics are strongly affected by the joint response, and joints need to be included as finite deformable elements in a realistic frame analysis.

AB - Results obtained from a research project dealing with the structural behavior of cold-formed members of cold-rolled stainless steel are presented. The distinctive mechanical properties include anisotropy, nonlinear and unsymmetrical stress-strain relationships in tension and compression, and the pronounced effect of cold working. The post-buckling behavior of thin compression elements stiffened along one or both unloaded edges by thin webs has been found to agree with Koiter's theory, with von Karman's relationship on effective width, as modified by Winter for carbon steel, as the lower bound. Using an iterative numerical procedure, the flexural strength and deflection of thin-walled cold-rolled stainless steel beams can be predicted accurately. A brief analysis on column behavior is also presented. Design methods taking into account the material characteristics and the post-buckling strength of the thin compression elements of these structural members are recommended.

AB - A special finite element technique is described which permits interconnection of line elements in flexure and first-order plane stress elements. Continuity of displacements and rotations at the junction of the two types of elements is satisfied by imposing certain constraint conditions through use of Lagrange multipliers. The method can be employed to analyze coupled shear walls as well as frame-shear wall systems. Accuracy is checked by analyzing a coupled shear wall system with three degrees of mesh refinement. Results are further compared with those from a conventional finite element scheme, which idealizes the coupling beams by plane stress elements. The proposed method is shown to be more accurate and more efficient than the conventional method.

Emphasis is placed on the warping behavior of the open section shear walls and interaction provided by bending and warping interconnecting floor slabs. Comparisons are made between the analytical results of the present method and those of a three-dimensional analysis in which warping is ignored. The order of magnitude of warping effects are such that to neglect them in the analysis of open section shear wall system might lead to serious errors in the calculated stresses and consequent design of structures.

AB - Varying dimensional instability of juxtaposed building materials in the presence of changing heat, moisture, and stress cause differential strains, inducing stresses that frequently exceed the ultimate strength of materials. Differential strains in masonry building elements are typically of such magnitude that stress relief is more practical than resistance. Bond breaks and expansion joints are used to prevent excessive stress. Methods are presented for determining moisture and thermal movements in brick masonry, allowable deflections in brick masonry walls, and the magnitude of differential strains between brick masonry and concrete. Design of expansion joints is examined. Details are given for flexible anchorage of slabs to walls and walls to frames. Failures resulting from inadequate design for differential movement are illustrated.

AB - A numerical step-by-step procedure is presented for the analysis of transversely loaded multilayer plates supported on regularly spaced elastic pillars. The layers are permitted to slide over each other at locations where the interface shear strength or friction is less than the horizontal shear stress, and individual layers are permitted to fracture at locations where the flexural stresses exceed flexural strength. The various strengths, as well as the other material properties, may be different for each layer and interface, and may also vary from point to point in each layer and interface. A detailed algorithm is given for the solution of the problem, and calculated strengths are compared with laboratory test results for three models.

AB - Since wood is becoming more important in structural design, and since many engineers are not familiar with its design, this bibliography was primarily prepared to assist the practicing engineer. Secondly, since the practice of diaphragm design is still developing, it also includes background and supplementary data for use by engineers and researchers. Abstracts are included to illustrate coverage and importance of the literature listed. A structural shear diaphragm is defined as a relatively thin building element in which the covering resists shear stresses, like the web of a deep beam, with perimeter members performing the function of flanges and stiffeners. Wood is becoming more important as a structural material for several reasons: (1) It is economical; (2) it is often more readily available than steel and concrete; (3) it requires less energy than either concrete or steel to convert it to usable form; and (4) it is our only naturally renewable construction material.

AB - A method is derived whereby warping shear stresses due to restraints or the variation of torque along a bar can be computed using finite elements. For completeness, it is also indicated how the restrained warping longitudinal stresses are calculated. In this paper, the effects of nonuniform torsion are incorporated into Herrmann.s solution for the case of thin-walled open sections.

AB - The behavior of structures that exhibit large displacements under loading must be predicted through a nonlinear analysis in which terms higher than first order are included in the strain-displacement relationship. To predict snap-through instabilities, the displacement method, using a finite element formulation, incorporates such a relationship. Although displacements may be large, often strains may be considered small in relation to unity, and therefore certain higher order terms are usually neglected. However, in some cases, doing so may lead to anomalous and inaccurate results. The present paper deals with this problem.

AB - After recent construction failures, several west European countries have decided to review their national standards. At the same time, on an European level, Task Group VIII-3 of the ECCS was formed to develop and codify design rules for ultimate strength design for large plate and box girder bridges. This technical note presents a synopsis of the problems encountered by the task group, with a special mention of the design of the compressed flanges of box-girder bridges.

AB - In a second moment format for a probabilistic structural design code, it is often necessary to estimate the mean and standard deviation of stress and strength, which in turn may be complicated functions of several random variables. In a broader sense, probabilistic analyses in many disciplines require knowledge of the first and second moments of complicated functions of random variables. This study attempts to describe, under special conditions, the errors introduced in the most widely used approximate method for making this calculation.
