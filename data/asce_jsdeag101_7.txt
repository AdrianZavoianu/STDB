AB - When subjected to severe ground shaking, a slender building may begin to tip about the edge of its foundation. Methods have been presented which allow the influence of tipping to be considered in the dynamic analysis of single-mass models of structures. Solutions have been obtained for the response of tipping systems subjected to simple transient ground motion. Two main effects of tipping on dynamic response have been identified. First, in comparison to fixed-base behavior, tipping leads to a favorable reduction in the maximum transverse deformation suffered by a structure. By contrast, the second effect is potentially dangerous. After a period of tipping when the foundation slams into renewed contact with the ground, collision impulses are generated in the superstructure and the supporting soil. These short duration high intensity normal forces could conceivably endanger the stability of the structure's compression members or lead to foundation failure.

AB - Prestressed concrete box beams are studied under combined loadings of torsion, bending, and shear. Thirty-seven eccentrically prestressed beams were tested—three under pure torsion, 10 under varying ratios of torsion and bending, and 24 under varying ratios of torsion, bending and shear. All beams had a 12-in. (305-mm) square cross section with an 8-1/2-in. (220-mm) diam hollow for the full length. Most of the beams contained web reinforcement in either of two stirrup spacings, but five beams without web reinforcement were also tested. Two shear span-to-depth ratios were utilized. Tests results include cracking patterns and strengths, ultimate failure modes and strengths, torque-twist, and flexural deformations. Analytical theories are developed for the initial cracking torque based upon elastic theory and for the ultimate strength based upon the skewed bending failure mechanism for prestressed concrete beams. Comparisons of the theoretical and experimental results are presented, and these generally correlated well.

AB - The problem of designing reinforced concrete intake-outlet towers, partially submerged in water, to withstand earthquake ground motion is examined in general terms. It is shown that water, surrounding as well as inside, significantly affects the response to ground motion and these hydrodynamic effects should be considered in the design of towers. A rational method for elastic design including the hydrodynamic effects is proposed. It is recommended that towers be designed to elastically resist ground motions which they may experience several times during their useful life. The ductility requirements that would be imposed on code-designed towers by the intense ground motions expected near the causative fault during high magnitude earthquakes are evaluated; they appear to be rather large. It is recommended that forces for elastic design be increased so that the lateral displacement ductility requirements imposed by the most intense ground motion that can occur at the site would be no larger than a ductility factor of two.

AB - The behavior of bolted connections without washers in light-gage steel is studied by extensive testing. Influence of pertinent parameters such as bolt diameter, edge distance, bolt spacing, etc., on the strength of the bolted connections are explored. Empirical formulas are presented and compared against those for bolted connections with washers. Warping of free edges, which occurs towards the end of testing, has negligible effect on the load carrying capacity of the connection. Tensile stress on net section at failure is a function of r, Fut, and d/s. By intuition the allowable shear stress on the gross cross-sectional area of bolts is the same for bolts with and without washers. The 23 confirmatory tests with washers compared favorably (within ±20%) with those of Winter's. The slip loads were generally raised with higher torques.

AB - The shear stresses arising in the region around a change in depth of a beam are studied. The discontinuities considered include changes with and without fillets. It is well known that such discontinuities produce high local shear stresses and various forms of analyses have been applied to this problem. However, despite the many analyses, it is difficult for a designer to obtain a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of shear stress in a particular situation without resorting to analysis. To overcome this difficulty the finite element method has been used to generate parametric solutions, presented in the form of graphs, which allow an estimate to be made of the maximum shear stress occuring over a range of geometry at the discontinuity. The accuracy of the finite element solutions has been gaged against photoelastic analyses of model beams.

Buckling experiments on precision small-scale diaphragm specimens are also described, which show, along with the comparative analysis of the different buckling formulas, that the simplified formula accurately predicts shear diaphragm buckling.

The theoretical results obtained in these methods were compared with experiments on two model staircases and it is found that the plate interaction method compares favorably with the experimental results.

AB - Iterative design is considered for the case in which the node locations are not fixed and an optimality condition is developed that involves the geometric stiffness matrix. It extends somewhat existing work on optimal design for trusses when node locations are allowed to vary. It uses an extremely simple truss model that does not consider questions of buckling, multiple loading, deflection constraints, etc., sacrificing realism in favor of simplicity. The member forces and node locations are determined subject to joint equilibrium. The Kuhn-Tucker conditions are derived in the usual manner and are solved to obtain an optimal solution using Newton's method for nonlinear systems. It would appear that the assumption of constant allowable stresses would correspond to a linearization of a more realistic truss model, but that remains to be shown.

AB - A computer program for the design and analysis of steel transmission towers or general trusses is presented. Successive iterations between analysis and design, with a tolerance controlled by the designer, are performed within the program to achieve convergence to the final solution. The program capabilities consist of: (1) Generating symmetric portions of geometry; (2) identifying and stabilizing planar (unbraced) nodes; (3) handling tension only members; (4) accounting for the buckling of members by using a bilinear force-displacement relationship; and (5) varying some key nodes to optimize the tower geometry. The redistribution of force due to buckling is achieved by modifying the force matrix only. The buckling and post-buckling behavior is similar to the actual behavior of such members in the transmission towers. The frontal equation solver with an automatic numbering skill has made the program more efficient.

AB - Tests were performed to determine load-deflection relationships for rib-type liner anchorages similar to those used in the primary containments for the Tennessee Valley Authority's Bellefonte Nuclear Plant. The anchors used included both structural angles and tees, and various lengths of 3/16-in. (4.6-mm) fillet welds were used to attach the anchors to the liner. Two different concrete strengths were tested. The tests were pull-out tests rather than the more common push-out variety. The reason for performing this type test was to: (1)Avoid plate stability problems; and (2) obviate the use of angle stiffeners generally employed to solve these problems. A complete set of results is presented in tabular form, and selected load-deflection curves are presented. It is concluded that the results of the testing program give a conservative representation of the load-deflection behavior of an anchor.

AB - A particular code is obtained after selecting a code format when its code parameters (e.g., load and performance factors in load factor design format) are assigned particular values. The proposed calibration scheme obtains a code such that predetermined levels of safety are maintained with respect to the limit states defined in the code. A reference design data set, which may vary for each limit state, is used to satisfy the calibrating objective. A second-moment safety index has been adopted as the measure of safety in the calibration procedure. The method is illustrated in the structural design section of the National Building Code of Canada proposed for 1975 as an example, involving four of the technologies and 11 limit states.

AB - The purpose of this research was to establish a more realistic lateral load distribution factor, in conjunction with the ASSHTO Load Factor Design Method. The distribution factor at ultimate load is designated as Dp, which is Dp = 3.45 — 1.809γ + 0.315γ², in which γ = number of girders/number of lanes. This equation gives approximately a value of S/7.0, as compared to the present value of S/5.5. The analytical method, which permitted development of this equation, considered the elastoplastic behavior of loaded composite girder slab bridge systems. The method involved solution of elastic plate equations with modifications to include inelastic action. Several design examples are presented in order to illustrate the use of the equations.

AB - A general and systematic method of analyzing the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of rigid-jointed plane frames with I-section members and subjected to in-plane loads is developed. The in-plane equations are solved first, and these solutions are used to linearize the flexural-torsional differential equations. The buckling equations, which consist of the bending and torsion differential equations, and the boundary, compatibility, warping, and joint equilibrium equations are solved numerically by the method of finite integrals, and the critical load factor is obtained iteratively. A computer program is developed in which most of the equations are progressively eliminated. This leads to significant reductions in the storage requirements and the computing time.

AB - The overall buckling of half-barrel shells made of corrugated steel sheets is studied in this paper. This type of buckling is recognized as a prime factor in defining ultimate load carrying capacity of such shells. The mathematical formulations are based on the linear theory or orthotropic cylindrical shells. The stability conditions are governed by two linear simultaneous differential equations in the deflection and a stress function. The series presentation of the deflection and the stress function yield a set of homogeneous linear simultaneous algebraic equations in the unknown deflection coefficients. The eigenvalues of this system are calculated with different load distributions representing the cases of snow and wind loads, as well as combined loading. Note that the magnitude of critical load as well as the mode of buckling are dependent on the ratio of length to radius of shell and the ratios between the rigidities in the longitudinal and circumferential directions.

The study is limited to the published information available and no attempt has been made to evaluate current design principles or to establish a rational basis of design for the safe use of structural members for elevated temperature applications. The paper concludes with an extensive list of references dealing with various aspects of the problem.

AB - This paper presents features of implementation of a transfer algorithm for solving linear ordinary differential equations using a digital computer. It shows results of applications to simple problems. Tests show the algorithm requires less computer time per step than other representative direct methods. It does not need adaptive error control. Variable time step logic is not required for integration to be efficient and effective. The consequences of these advantages are evidence in reducing computer times for Runge-Kutta integration by a factor of 4,000 while obtaining answers of improved accuracy. The examination shows that the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm dictate use of an integration step size of the order of one-fifth the time of the shortest system period represented. The relation between the period and the number of calculations to generate the transfer matrix provides a reliable means of insuring that the appropriate time step is being used.

It is shown that inclusion of plastic central regions of finite extent in addition to yield lines results in improved upper bounds for the collapse loading. It is also shown that the effect of finite displacement is to increase the calculated carrying capacity of intermediate length folded plate structures to close approximation with actual test results.

Sander's thin shell equations were used in conjunction with the finite element method to determine the bifurcation buckling load of the shell. The experimental program yielded data on the instability behavior of hyperboloidal shells subjected to combined loadings. Molded PVC specimens were used in the experiments. Shell specimens were: (1) Clamped on both ends; and (20 clamped on one end and free on the other end. The experimental data were found to be in good agreement with the analysis for all types of loading conditions.

AB - This note reports on the possibility of allowing some extra movement in a tower-like structure. This movement would activate a damper and thus dissipate energy and hopefully reduce response. Examination of a simple single degree-of-freedom bar and spring mechanism showed that it was actually possible, under certain circumstances, to reduce dynamic response by the introduction of an additional degree-of-freedom, e.g., a hinge, equipped with finite stiffness and viscous damping. The idea is not obvious, but is attractive, since no extra weight is added, and passive viscous dampers, being unsophisticated, seem reliable enough.

AB - To determine the deflected line of a beam, it is necessary to know the relationship between the bending moment and the curvature. It the cross section is defined, the desire relationship can be found using the stress-strain curve of the material. A number of approximations of the latter plot have been proposed and a few simpler ones have been investigated.
