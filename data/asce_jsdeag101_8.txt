AB - This paper presents a theory for the behavior of prestressed and reinforced concrete beams of rectangular section subjected to combined bending and torsion. The theory will predict the strains in the longitudinal and transverse steel and in the concrete at all levels of loading up to failure. It applies to underreinforced, partially overreinforced, and fully overreinforced beams. Theoretical predictions for torque-stress relations are compared with published test data.

AB - The simultaneous differential equations for bending out of the plane of symmetry and for torsion of tapered monosymmetric I-beams are derived by considering the flange displacements. It is found that these equations are not independent because the shear center and the longitudinal centroidal axes are not parallel, and it is concluded that torsion is always accompanied by bending out of the plane of symmetry. The bending and torsion equations simplify considerably for the particular case of tapered monosymmetric I-beams of constant depth. The elastic stability of tapered monosymmetric simply supported I-beams of constant depth with central concentrated loads acting in the plane of the webs is also investigated both theoretically and experimentally. The governing differential equations for bending and torsion are solved numerically by the method of finite integrals.

AB - Concrete submerged for 67-yr in seawater has shown that low permeability concrete is highly durable to sulfate attack; however, more permeable concrete is susceptible to sulfate attack. Large concrete blocks were retrieved off the Los Angeles Harbor breakwater. Concrete blocks of size 69 in. x 69 in. x 42 in. which were retrieved were part of a test program initiated by the Corps of Engineers in 1905. Cores were tested for compressive strength and material deterioration to determine if the concrete was attacked by seawater. Results from other reports of sulfate attack on concrete are summarized. It is concluded that for long-time durability of concrete exposed to seawater, a reduced permeability and reduced alkalinity of concrete appear to be as important as low 3 Ca.Al2O3 content of cement.

AB - A simple approximate reanalysis technique is presented for use in the automated (optimum) design of large and complex structures. The technique is based on the use of the reduced basis method in conjunction with substructuring approach. The displacement vector of the modified structure is approximated by a linear combination of a normalized set of s first-order sensitivity analysis vectors, where s is the number of design variables. Consideration is focused on the potential advantages of the reduced basis - substructuring technique for use in automated design systems. The high accuracy of the proposed technique for sizable changes in the design variables is demonstrated by means of a numerical example of a large transmission tower. Also, comparison is made with Taylor expansion method based on the reciprocal variables.

AB - A freestanding stair with slabless tread-risers could be architecturally attractive. The analysis of freestanding stairs has been studied by Fuchssteiner, Szabo, Leibenberg, Siev, Sauter, Taleb, Susens and Kuang, Gould, and others. A staircase, with slabless tread-risers is one that creates architectural attractive effects. The analysis of this latter type of stairs has been studied by Saenz and Martin, Benjamin, Cusens, and others. This paper presents the analysis of a stair type that combines the two foregoing features. The case of symmetrical load of fixed ends is illustrated. This type of stair consists of an upper and lower flight and a landing slab with uniform thickness. The entire structure is an ordinary reinforced construction.
