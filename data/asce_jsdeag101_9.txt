AB - Civil engineers are now required by law to consider esthetics in structural design. Although new disciplines of psychophysical and sociophysical technology are developing, present design principles in tectonic art have developed by the process of natural selection, the survival of the fittest. They provide a highly useful method for the arrangement of visual elements in the continuum of forms from smooth planes, through texture, relief, and mass to space. Style is defined as an expression of the design ideal; character as clarity of the statement; and unity as consistency in the symbol system. The ordered reoccurrence of elements is called rhythm. The relationship between parts of the design is termed proportion. The scale of space and its boundaries is related to appropriate size. A chronological ordering of the observer's exposure to space is defined as sequence.

AB - Laboratory experiments were conducted to observe and measure the response amplitude and frequency of a simply supported column. The column was excited by axial forces generated from sinusoidal and random (bandwidths of 3 Hz, l0 Hz, 30 Hz, and l00 Hz) signals. The column will vibrate near its natural frequency if the excitation contains a sufficiently high level power spectral density within the parametric resonance zone of the column. The variance of the response amplitude decreases with increasing bandwidth of excitation. A zero amplitude of response is found during a considerable portion of the excitation time; this indicates there is a discrete component in the probability distribution at zero amplitude.

AB - A straightforward method is shown for calculating thermal stresses in bridges. Unsteady temperature distributions are obtained from numerical solutions of the one-dimensional unsteady heat equation, and comparison with experiment seems to validate the simplifying assumption that horizontal heat movements are small enough to be ignored. Stresses are calculated by solving a two-dimensional thermoelastic problem, and a design example shows that stresses calculated in this way can be significantly larger than stresses calculated by ignoring the coupling effect between longitudinal and lateral stresses.

AB - A method of estimating the load carrying capacity of steel W-shape beams with reinforced eccentric web openings is developed. The analysis is limited to single rectangular openings and to reinforcing bars positioned above and below the opening and oriented parallel to the edges of the opening. Computer solutions in the form of interaction diagrams relating the shear and moment at the center of the opening can be generated using an iterative process. The coordinates of points defining an approximate interaction diagram suitable for design are also derived. Examples of interaction diagrams for a specified yield stress and selected beam and opening dimensions are presented to illustrate the effects of varying reinforcing area, opening length, and opening eccentricity on the strength of a beam with a web opening. For the range of opening eccentricity considered in the examples, the eccentricity could be neglected for design purposes.

AB - A single element panel (SEP) has been developed in this paper for use in the analysis of slab-column type structures; a slab panel being defined by column center lines or boundary of the floor system, or both. The generated SEP stiffness matrix takes into account the influence of parameters related to the slab and column dimensions. In the case of a multistory flat plate building, the proposed technique would permit the analysis of a structural system consisting of columns and single element panels as connecting members. The analysis of two multistory flat plate buildings under lateral loading shows that the proposed technique can predict the distribution of lateral loads among columns and story drifts as accurately as a finite element solution (FES). The former involves a considerably smaller number of stiffness equations than the latter, thus producing significant savings in computation costs. The proposed technique is also shown to be far superior in accuracy and reliability to the equivalent frame technique (EQF).

AB - Supreme court decisions, Federal law, and governmental regulations now require civil engineering design to give appropriate consideration to environmental amenities. Anthropology clearly demonstrates that art is a fundamental characteristic of human society. The philosophies of esthetics have ranged broadly from the relative to the absolute, but eminent philosophers since Plato have urged a rational approach. For the past two centuries, civil engineering has been rooted in the physical sciences. The behavioral sciences can now be added as a source for the formulation of design principles. Recent psychological research has provided a promising means for the development of a rational design methodology. There is hope of quantifying esthetics, developing an esthetic modulus, and establishing truth about beauty.

AB - Described in this paper is a method to obtain equivalent modal viscous damping ratios from stiffness and energy dissipation properties of structural components. Specifically, modal viscous damping ratios are computed as the weighted sum of component energy ratios (ratio of energy dissipated to peak potential energy per cycle of motion) weighted by the ratios of component to total peak potential energies. Component energy ratios may be estimated from vibration studies of the individual components or similar structures made exclusively of the component materials. Component potential energies may be computed from component stiffness matrices and modal deflections. A great simplification is that total peak potential energy may be computed as half the natural circular frequency squared for mode shapes normalized such that the generalized mass equals unity. Modal viscous damping ratios are computed for four example structures all having reinforced concrete frames with gypsum wallboard partitions. Damping ratios predicted and measured vary from 2% to 5%.

AB - The punching shear strength of restrained concrete slabs is investigated. A rational idealized model of a restrained slab at punching failure is developed. This model is an extension of one previously developed by Kinnunen and Nylander for simply supported slabs. The influence of boundary restraints on punching load is demonstrated and the model is shown to yield accurate estimates of the punching strength of slabs with known boundary restraints. An empirical factor, termed the restraint factor, is introduced to estimate the influence of boundary restraints and can be used in the design of slabs for which the actual restraints are not exactly known. The restraint factors for a number of restrained slab systems are reported.

AB - Vibrations induced into rail rapid transit structures may be radiated from the structure as airborne noise that disturbs the rider and the wayside community, or as ground-borne vibrations that propagate into the foundations of wayside structures setting walls, floors, and common household items into annoying vibration. This report describes the results of field measurements on existing steel elevated structures presented to aid civil engineers concerned with design, performance, repair, and evaluation of steel elevated transportation structures. These measurements showed that peak acceleration levels are generated in decreasing order of magnitude on the rail, on the top and bottom girder flanges, on the girder web, on cross-bracing, on the column, and at the footing base. In addition, peak acceleration levels of 70 g are little attentuated as they are transmitted from the rail through the structure, and peak acceleration levels significantly increase for increasing train speeds.

AB - Color is the subjective response to the objective stimulus of radiant energy of particular wavelength and intensity. Wavelengths determine hue; intensity determines brightness. Color is identified by three methods: (1) verbal description; (2) sample comparison; and (3) physical measurement. The Munsell method of notation accurately describes color in three terms of hue, value (lightness), and chroma (saturation or vividness). The ASTM Standards provide methods for precise identification of color by the Munsell system. The National Bureau of Standards has adopted a standard color terminology used by many industries. Psychological research has provided useful data on color preference and a rational method for color selection. From the behavioral sciences has come the developing technology of psychophysics, which permits measurement of color differences and establishes color tolerances for stated levels of consumer acceptance.

It implements theoretical velocity profiles to convert reported damage width data at low velocity thresholds to damage widths for velocities that might cause structural damage. A stationary uniform arrival process with geographically dependent rate is used along with joint statistical properties for damage width, damage length, peak wind velocity, and direction of travel. Design curves for evaluating the damage likelihood and examples of their application are included. A critical analysis of the procedure is also presented.

AB - The finite element technique is used for the forced vibration analysis of horizontally curved box girder bridges. Annular plates and cylindrical shell elements are used to discretize the slab, bottom flanges and webs. Rectangular plate elements and pin-jointed bar elements are used for diaphragms discretization. A vehicle, as the applied time varying forcing function, is simulated by two sets of concentrated forces, having component in the radial and transverse directions and moving with constant angular velocities on circumferential paths of the bridge. The effect of centrifugal forces is considered and the effect of damping of the bridge is neglected in the analysis. The mass condensation technique is used to reduce the number of coupled differential equations obtained from the finite element method. The resulting differential equations are solved by the linear acceleration method. A number of bridges with practical geometries are analyzed and impact factors are calculated.

AB - An analytical study of the phenomenon of rainwater ponding on beam-girder roof systems has been performed. For roof systems with nondeforming boundaries and no interior columns, formulas are presented for determining maximum moments in the system due to both live and dead loads and ponding loads. These formulas are in a form suitable for design office use and offer the advantage of enabling the designer to directly check stresses instead of the awkward procedure of comparing stress index parameters as now commonly done in practice. The consideration of a dish deflected shape in many cases will more accurately model the actual configuration and is treated for the first time in this paper. The use of the formulas presented herein will generally lead to more economical designs than heretofore available for ponding of two-way roof systems.

AB - The research on steel box girders in the United Kingdom which followed the recent bridge disasters is reviewed. The feature special to box girders rather than plate girders is the wider use of thin stiffened plate in the former. Because of this many of the design procedures developed for plate girders are not directly applicable to box girders. Among the aspects examined are the role of imperfections in reducing the strength of compression flanges, the difficulties in applying available tension field theories to box-girder web design, and the stress systems and other parameters affecting the design of load-bearing diaphragms. The key points of the research results which helped form the basis of the Merrison Design Rules are presented. These rules, which are based on limit state design philosophy, are the most comprehensive available to date for box-girder design. Those areas needing further investigation are also identified.

AB - The random generation of a small fire in a building, and its random growth into a large fire, which consumes the combustible contents of a compartment, are described by a new unified stochastic model, based upon the theory of the Poisson process. This model assumes unequal compartments and heterogeneity of risk of fire among them. The random failure of the building from fire is then described by a stochastic model based upon both the fire generation model and the lognormal distribution. The second mathematical model improves upon its predecessor by avoiding the underestimation of the probability of failure from fire, for fixed nonstructural parameters.

AB - An experimental study is presented of the behavior of reinforced concrete inverted umbrella hypar shell models loaded with uniform load to failure. Reinforced microconcrete model shells with three different edge member geometries were tested. The shell strength was controlled by the tensile edge members around the periphery of the shell, and was independent of position of edge members with respect to shell midthickness. Ultimate load capacity was about l50 psf (7,l80 N/m2). Shells without compressive ribs had the same strength and only slightly more flexibility than similar shells with compressive ribs. The edge members and a substantial portion of adjacent shell act together in resisting the accumulated membrane shears from the shell. This interaction is defined with an effective width concept based on PVC model results. Direct stresses in the shell differ substantially from membrane theory predictions; the tensile principal stress exceeds the compressive principal stress in all cases. The ratio of bending stress to direct stress is on the order of 1 in the edge members and considerably higher in the shell.

AB - Inclusion of shear deformations allows the bending theory to be extended to relatively thick beams and shells and, at the same time, simplifies the finite element formulation for both thick and thin beams because monotonic convergence may be achieved without ensuring continuity of displacement derivatives between adjacent elements. Consequently, on may use low order interpolation polynomials, including linear ones. This is particularly useful in the case of curved beams because with higher order interpolation polynomials it is very difficult to satisfy exactly the conditions of no self-staining at rigid body rotations and of availability of all constant strain states, while with linear displacement interpolation polynomials and a straight shape of the element these requirements are easily met.

AB - This paper is to report on an investigation of shakedown response where the initial load was equal to the fully plastic load. Thus, no preceding yield history was present. A previous theoretical investigation indicated that shakedown deflections where the first load was slightly higher than the fully plastic load were approximately equal to the shakedown deflections where yielding occurred gradually due to a long history of prior cyclic loading. The theoretical deflections of the two types of loading history agreed exactly at the first load level above the fully plastic load. This next load level was in excess of the fully plastic load by 7%. Physical testing to corroborate the theoretical evidence is reported in this paper. A total of three beams were tested.

AB - Numerical integration techniques are most convenient for accounting for the in-plane inelastic behavior of restrained steel columns permitted to sway. The Column Deflection Curve approach, for example, is one such method. It is also possible to utilize the Column Curvature Curve method in the analysis of these compression members. However, herein, the column integration technique recently developed by the writer is used. The advantage of this procedure is that because bending moments are employed as the main variable, both equilibrium and compatibility can be satisfied simultaneously so that direct convergence to a unique solution is ensured at the end of each integration cycle. A computer program based upon this concept tends to be less time-consuming and does not encounter convergence difficulties even in the unstable portion of the load-deformation curve of such members.
