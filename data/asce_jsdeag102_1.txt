AB - A method is proposed to determine design forces for earthquake-resistant design of reinforced concrete structures. The method uses a modified linear model of the structure and recognizes the effect of energy dissipation in the nonlinear range of response. Thus, the designer is provided with a procedure, at the level of linear spectral response analysis, with explicit options about the levels of inelastic response in different elements of a multistory reinforced concrete structure. The paper contains analytical tests of two-story to 10-story frames designed according to the proposed method.

AB - The forest roads of British Columbia provide examples of large and complex single-lane industrial bridges for logging trucks up to 150 tons. A common element is the large pressure-creosoted glued laminated wood (glulam) structural member. Configurations include: (1) Simple beams up to 86 in. deep, rectangular or with I shapes having typically about 16-in.-square flanges and 11-in. thick webs; (2) cantilevers with suspended spans; (3) trussed glulam girders with one, two or three hanging bents and bottom chords of cable, bars, or rolled sections. The girders can have erection splices and carry erection loads before trussing; and (4) cable-suspended spans with straight cables from one or more points to each tower. Simple beams span up to 150ft; complex configurations from 120 ft to well over 200 ft. Decks are transverse wood ties with longitudinal planks, or transverse nail-laminated. Substructures often use wood or steel pipe piles up to superstructure level.

AB - Top-braced open thin-walled steel box girders under combined bending and torsion were studied. Two model box girders were tested in the elastic range. Analytically, the top bracing of open box sections was converted to an equivalent plate thus forming an equivalent closed box. Experimental results on top-braced open boxes and computed stresses for the equivalent closed boxes agreed fairly well. Rotations calculated from deflections without adjustment of support rotations were higher than the values computed for the equivalent closed boxes. Deformation of cross section was neglected in the analysis. The stresses in the bracing members were estimated using stresses in the equivalent top plate as loads on a bracing frame. The estimated stresses also compared well with experimental results. Based on the concept of equivalent closed box, a procedure was recommended for the selection of bracing member sizes.

AB - A method is presented for calculating the structural fire endurance of concrete members under various conditions of axial and bending restraints. Included is the calculated temperature distribution during a fire within concrete sections. Practical illustrative examples are given. Conclusions were: (1) Temperature distributions can be calculated for various cross sections and aggregate types, and from these data and information on temperature-strength relations, the material strength can be obtained at any time during a fire; (2) equilibrium conditions at collapse, considering bending and axial restraint simultaneously, were obtained and show that time of collapse depends on the axial restraining force, its line of action, and member deflections; (3) axial restraining forces increase fire resistance; (4) for interior bays, fire resistance is independent of the restraining force location; (5) equilibrium conditions are independent of deflections whenever axial restraining forces are neglected; and (6) members in concrete structures can develop substantial restraining forces.

AB - Although it is essential to ensure that unbraced multistory steel frames are stable under fully factored gravity loads alone, only few techniques are available for analyzing them under these ultimate conditions. This paper presents one such method using the concept that frame instability occurs when one story becomes unstable. The effects of plastic hinge formation are considered, and the mechanisms which can lead to instability are described. The proposed technique has been successfully compared with experimental results and a more sophisticated approach.

AB - Cold-formed steel wall studs generally are I, Z, or channel shaped with or without stiffening lips and with webs perpendicular to the plane of the wall. Because of their configuration and dimensions, these sections are quite unstable by themselves. However, the stability and, thus, the load-carrying capacity of such studs are increased substantially once they are connected to the wall board material. In this paper the general behavior is formulated and a design procedure is presented. The analytical results are verified on the basis of an experimental investigation.

AB - The behavior of two quarter full-size seven-story reinforced concrete coupled shear walls, with conventionally and diagonally reinforced coupling beams, subjected to static reversed cyclic loading to simulate seismic effects, is compared in terms of stiffness degradation, ductilities attained, and energy absorption capacity. In the walls coupled by conventionally reinforced coupling beams, the sliding shear failure of the beams limits the energy absorption capacity of the structure. In every respect the superior performance of the structure containing diagonally reinforced beams is established. The use of ductile diagonally reinforced coupling beams enabled a considerable portion of the total energy to be dissipated by the coupling system thereby relieving plastic hinges in the walls. The results show that with careful detailing, coupled shear wall structures can be made to possess all the desirable features of an effective earthquake-resistant structure.

The advantages and disadvantages of both the equilibrium and energy approaches are examined and recommendations are given as to when each approach should be used. Design examples include both irregular and regular slab systems. For flat slabs consideration is given to flexural yield fans in the vicinity of columns and to exterior panels with or without edge beams. Designs are compared with the ACI 318-71 code requirements for slabs.

AB - A beam-analog to continuously attached elements has been established as a method for the analysis of a continuum. Although the analog grid is composed only of orthogonally connected beams, it takes the Poisson's effect into consideration. This effect is introduced by considering that the principal axes of the beam cross sections lie in planes inclined to the plane of the element. The discretization of the element is made by lumping its stiffness properties and loads uniformly in two orthogonal directions along the length of the beams. Different examples are chosen to represent different boundary conditions, including the free edge and the free corner, under the action of different types of loads. There is agreement between the results obtained by applying the proposed analog, and those calculated by the available exact solutions as well as the experimental results.

AB - Documentations of windstorm induced damage to buildings have revealed patterns of failures in glass which suggest that two phenomena are at work: local wind pressures and windborne missiles. Analysis of damage to glass indicate that these two phenomena account for a large portion of the recorded damage. Phenomena associated with wind flow around multistory buildings produce relatively large surface pressure fluctuations on building surfaces. The mean pressures produced by these fluctuations may reach values which are twice as large as windward wall stagnation pressures. Air flow over gravel surfaced roofs in urban areas has been shown to produce windborne missiles which can break windows in adjacent buildings. This phenomenon is a significant factor in many window breakage incidents. Both local wind pressures and hazards associated with windborne missiles must be recognized by the building designer if the increasing window failure rate is to be mitigated.

AB - A theory is developed that permits determination of the resulting bolt forces in bolted T-stub and end plate connections, subject to prying action. The theory includes both the case in which separation in the bolt lines occurs before and the case in which it occurs after the reduced yield moment of the T-stub flange or end plate is reached. Tests show that, due to strain hardening in the T-stub flange or end plate, a strength reserve exists beyond the yield load as defined in the theory. A comparison of the results of the tests with the results of previously proposed semi-empirical formulas shows that these yield rather conservative estimates of the prying forces. The difference between the test results and the results of the formulas given in the current AISC Manual of Steel Contruction is considerable.

AB - A method has been developed to predict the ultimate strength of concrete beams reinforced with a combination of steel bars and randomly distributed steel fibers. Strengths of three full-size beams were obtained experimentally to verify the analytical method. The method, which applies to beams using a cement-rich mortar mix with the steel fibers, shows good correlation with experimental results. A dynamic bond stress of 333 psi was assumed for the fibers. Fiber lengths were from 1-1/2 in. to 2-1/4 in. and the fiber amount was varied from 1.22% to 1.51% by volume. The test programs showed that: (1) Steel fibrous concrete increased the flexural load capacity of the reinforced beams by about 25%; (2) crack width and crack spacing were less than in a conventional reinforced beam; and (3) the post-cracking stiffness of the fibrous beams was greater than a conventional beam.

AB - This paper reviews the results of three full-size symmetrically-loaded moment-resisting beam-to-column connections: (1) A fully-welded connection where the beam flanges and web are groove welded to the column flange; (2) a seated connection where the beam flanges again are groove welded to the column flange but beam shear is carried by a beam seat which is fillet welded to the column flange; and (3) a connection in which only the flanges of the beam are groove welded to the column flange, leaving the beam flanges to carry both shear and moment. Results show that test 1 performed well, achieving good stiffness, strength and ductility at maximum load. Test 2 also displayed good strength and stiffness but had little ductility at maximum load due to buckling of the beam web. With the use of bearing stiffeners on the beam, the ductility of test 2 was increased to a value close to that of test 1. Test 3 attained only a low strength level but exhibited ductility nearly equal to test 1.

Railroad bridge loadings and stress histories of the primary and the secondary members are examined. Formulas based on Miner's cumulative damage hypothesis are proposed for equivalent number of design stress cycles to be used in the design of main members and of secondary members subject to superposition of overall and local stresses. Numerical examples are included. It is concluded that present AREA fatigue design provisions may be too conservative.

AB - The bond strengths were determined for 23 epoxy-coated (10 different epoxy coatings), six polyvinyl chloride-coated (three different coating materials), and five uncoated reinforcing bars. The length of embedment of the reinforcing bar in the concrete was 12 in. (305 mm). The loads or bond stresses corresponding to a loaded-end slip of 0.01 in. (0.25 mm) or a free-end slip of 0.002 in. (0.051 mm) were considered as critical values in determining the bond strength, depending on which of these values of slip developed first. For coating film thicknesses ranging from 0.001 in. to 0.011 in., the epoxy-coated bars developed bond strengths essentially equal to the bond strengths for uncoated bars. Experimental values were higher than minimum acceptable values in building code and highway bridge requirements. Bond strengths of the polyvinyl chloride-coated bars and bars with thick epoxy coatings were unacceptable.

AB - This paper describes the design of a large 500-ft × 40-ft (15-m × 12-m) paper machine mat foundation, several complex loaded and supported mat segments were analyzed using the finite element displacement approach. Possible sinkhole activity was simulated in the analysis by totally removing the soil support tributary to certain heavily loaded columns or walls. It is shown that this approach is well suited for the analysis of the structural response of complex loaded and shaped raft foundations on nonuniform soil support, especially if the performance criteria is specified in terms of deflections, both short-term and long-term. The analytical procedure outlined in this paper made selection of a constant mat thickness of 3 ft (0.9-m) possible, thus providing the basis for an economical solution. Some comparisons with other approaches are also presented.

This is achieved by assuming the same displacement field for the foundation as that used for the beam. The foundation is assumed to be of the Winkler type but it offers resistance not only to normal forces but to shear and torsional ones. The new foundation stiffness matrix is easily incorporated into existing structural analysis computer programs. Numerical examples are given. They include single members on or in an elastic medium and general skeletal structures partially or fully buried underground. Accurate and efficient solutions are obtained.

AB - A number of multistory buildings, containing concrete shear cores to house vertical services, have sustained major damage in recent earthquakes. Simplified analytical models for the shear cores cannot account for the relative stiffness of intersecting walls and for the influence of openings on the wall stiffness. Wall stress calculations are also beyond the capabilities of many of these continuum models. To remedy this, a three-dimensional shear core analytical model composed of two-dimensional rectangular plane stress and plate bending finite elements was developed. A subassemblage of finite elements forms a superelement and a stack of superelements is assembled in series elimination fashion to model the core tower. Determination of vibration frequencies, mode shapes, and nodal displacements for several isolated shear cores demonstrates the capabilities of the model. This general purpose analytical model can be readily incorporated into existing multistory-building frame models, and can serve as a basis for evaluation of simpler continuum models.

AB - It has previously been shown that savings in material coasts of up to 25% can be obtained due to prestressing in the design of simply supported composite beams for buildings and deck type highway bridges. The objective of this technical note is to demonstrate that prestressing leads to similar cost savings also in the design of two-span continuous composite highway bridge girders utilizing the available rolled steel sections.

AB - Theoretical investigations in the area of optimum structural design have increased dramatically during the past decade. The idea of finding a structure of minimum weight has long intrigued the designer. The present work is concerned with minimum weight cantilever beams subjected to either a concentrated tip load or a uniformly distributed load. The problem in itself has some interesting practical significance in that the weight penalties for certain structures such as transmission poles and chimneys can be approximately deduced from the cantilever beam results.
