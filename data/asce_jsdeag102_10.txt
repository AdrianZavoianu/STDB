AB - The use of a reduced width of flange as a means of allowing for shear lag effects in wide shallow composite box girders with an overhanging top flange is examined. Equivalent widths with beam theory leads to a gross underestimation of the maximum stresses and deflections for girders with short spans and gives no significant improvement over the results obtained by beam theory alone for girders with long spans. Thus, equivalent widths do not provide an acceptable method of dealing with shear lag effects in wide-flange shallow box girders; simple beam theory without equivalent widths gives a satisfactory estimate of maximum longitudinal stresses and deflections for girders in which the span-to-width ratio is greater than 12 for the overhanging portion and greater than 5 for the central portion of a flange between two webs; and a more rigorous theory such as folded plate analysis should be used for girders in which the foregoing span-width ratios are not satisfied.

AB - A simplified method for obtaining the load associated with the onset of local buckling in certain types of long-span end-supported concrete folded plate structures is presented. The method is applicable to structures with length to depth ratios greater than fifteen to one. The method considers the nonlinear material behavior of concrete and is based upon an application of the tangent modulus theory. Numerical examples are given which show that the proposed method yields conservative results when compared with elastic buckling analyses. The question of an appropriate factor of safety against buckling is mentioned and a tentative recommendation made that this be 2.2 when plate width to thickness ratios are less than 64 and the proposed method of analysis is used.

AB - In stayed girder bridges with two or three spans the horizontal displacement of pylon tops is prevented by the so-called fix-cables, i.e., upper end span cables. If stayed girder bridges are constructed with several equal main spans the intermediate pylons will tend to move horizontally under one-sided loading. This induces a rotation of the entire cable system giving unacceptable vertical deflections of the stiffening girder. To obtain the necessary stiffness two measures might be taken, either application of triangular pylon structures with sufficient horizontal rigidity at the top, or introduction of a horizontal fix-cable (tie) connecting all pylon tops.

AB - Araldite hyperboloidal shell models with nearly perfect geometry and constant thickness were tested under various axisymmetric combinations of membrane stresses. During the tests the normal forces and bending moments in the middle of the model were measured and the initiation of the buckling process was studied. The experimental results are compared with calculated values using the classical linear buckling theory. The experimental values fitted an empirical law. A new approach, based on the theoretical results and the tests carried out, is proposed to determine the buckling safety of hyperboloidal shells.

AB - Vibration absorbers are used in machine design to transfer fatigue-producing stresses from valuable equipment to relatively inexpensive replaceable devices. That is, the absorber becomes highly stressed over a certain frequency range while relieving the stress from the equipment. A similar phenomenon can occur in buildings to the detriment of the part of the building that behaves like an absorber. A seismic analysis of a building that exhibited this phenomenon is presented. A theoretical development for such behavior in this building is described.

AB - The basic structural components of the shells are doubly corrugated steel panels fabricated of thin sheet steel that is first deformed into a U-shaped big corrugation. Then, to obtain the proper curvature, small corrugations are rolled into the bottom and into the sides of the big corrugation. The proposed finite element model consists of an assemblage of curved rectangular elements with boundaries parallel to lines of principal curvature of the shell. Sanders' linearized strain-displacement equations are chosen for the description of the kinematics of deformation of the middle surface of a finite element. The small corrugations are replaced by an equivalent orthotropic material of uniform thickness. Suitable constitutive equations are developed. Static analyses are performed for two different doubly corrugated shells. Some of the predictions of the analysis are compared with experimental results.

AB - Dynamic response quantities, treated parametrically in time, are included in the problem for the first time. The method is made efficient by the use of the following approximation concepts: (1)Design variable linking; (2)time parametric constraint deletion; and (3)use of the first-order Taylor series expansions of the dynamic response functions with respect to the design variables. It is found that the feasible design space in an optimum structural design problem in the dynamic response regime is usually disjoint. The Davidon-Fletcher-Powell algorithm is used for the unconstrained minimizations. To successfully implement the exterior penalty function with approximate constraints, dummy boundaries and a new concept of move limits are introduced. It is found that the sinusoidal contributions in the relation between design variables and dynamic response functions can cause infeasible minima of the exterior penalty function.

AB - In relation to the wind loading on structures, the frequency, size, maximum wind speed, and duration time of the severe typhoons in Japan are reviewed. The distributions of the damages caused by the typhoons and the expected maximum wind speed are presented. Based on previous typhoons, the Structural Standards for wind resistant design of buildings was recently proposed by the Architectural Institute of Japan. The Standards is introduced with some comments. The importance of the wind load on tall buildings is emphasized in comparison with earthquake forces. Special attention paid to the wind resistant design of cladding is mentioned. Wind load problems on towers and stacks are also briefly considered.
