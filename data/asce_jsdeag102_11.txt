AB - The effect of periodic overloads on enhancement or delay of fatigue crack initiation and propagation at a transverse stiffener detail is investigated. A total of 73 specimens fabricated from A588 steel were tested. The overloading conditions were: (1)No overloads; (2)one overload applied at the beginning; and (3)six cases in which overloads were applied every 106 to 10 constant amplitude cycles. The ratio of overload to the loads applied during constant cycling was 1.67. Overloads applied every 103 cycles or farther apart extended life with the longest delay occuring at a spacing of about 105 cycles. The transition from delay to enhancement of fatigue cracking occurred at 102 cycles. Reasons for delay effects on fatigue crack initiation and propagation are presented.

AB - The recommendations are based on the steel deck serving as the structural load-carrying element during the construction phase and the composite steel-deck concrete floor slab serving as the load-carrying element for the service-load phases. The recommendations focus on application of strength principles based upon data obtained from performance tests for the shear-bond and flexural failure modes. The design equations for the shear-bond capacity are derived from data obtained by means of a performance test series. A separate regression is necessary for each steel deck profile; and, in addition, a separate regression is suggested for each steel gage thickness, steel surface coating, and concrete type. Additional recommendations presented consider construction, shoring, deflections, and span-to-depth ratios.

AB - Titanium and its alloys have favorably high strength, good fatigue life, and excellent corrosion resistance. Also, they are lightweight and nonmagnetic. Because of these attractive properties, the Navy had several titanium wire ropes fabricated for testing purposes. The first one about 10 yr ago, the last one about 5 yr ago. These wire ropes were tensile and fatigue tested by several Navy laboratories. On the basis of fatigue test performance, however, they all were deemed unacceptable for their intended use. In this paper, the titanium wire ropes and their tests are briefly described. In addition, the test results are summarized and examined in terms of the problems that plague any future development of a marine titanium wire rope. One such problem concerns the inherently poor resistance of titanium alloys to wear and galling in the presence of high-abrasion-causing loads. Another concerns the use of good quality titanium wire to fabricate rope.

AB - The behavior of hipped hypar shells is significantly different from that assumed in the membrane. The concept of equal arch and catenary actions is no longer valid. A finite element analysis of a typical shell indicates that the loads are carried by dominant arch actions, spanning across diagonally opposite supports. The investigation of forces and bending moments in the membrane and edge members lead to a method for the preliminary design of such shells. The method includes procedures for local membrane thickening necessitated by stress concentration or by bending effects.

AB - An analytical method using finite differences, has been developed by which the elastic and elastoplastic deformations of simply supported composite bridges can be predicted. At ultimate load (factored AASHTO Live Load), the effective width of the slab can then be determined. Using the developed computed program, many composite bridges were then analyzed. The effective widths at ultimate load were then determined, resulting in two empirical equations.

AB - A series of tests on 10-3/4in. (270-mm) tubes was conducted to determine the plastic rotation capacity of tubular beams. Six different D/t values ranging from 18-102 were used in the tests. Cantilever and fixed-ended beams, with moment gradients (shears) and restraints against ovalizing at the end, are compared with the behavior of the constant moment region of simple beams. Tubes with D/t greater than about 50 do not have sufficient plastic hinge rotation capacity to develop the classical ultimate strength. In the absence of a small moment gradient or stiffening, the plastic moment is not quite reached in tubes with D/t of 35. For inelastic buckling in the range of D/t of 18-80, critical strains appear to be proportional to (t/D)2, as opposed to the conventionallinear relationship. Information concerning the complex post-buckling behavior is also presented.

AB - A comprehensive review is presented of current practice regarding shell-like structures composed of a network of elements in the form of grids, domes, hypars, and other shapes. The review provides a general overview of all the important aspects of a latticed structure and emphasizes the characteristics common to all latticed structures rather than treating each form as a unique topic. The report begins with a background history and architectural form. Several shapes and member arrangements are illustrated by existing structures. The report continues with examination of various methods of analysis and stability determination. In addition to general descriptions, tables are included which catalogue the existing methods and show where they are applicable. References are made to an extensive bibliography where more detailed information on specific topics can be obtained. The report concludes with two sections on design and construction. Several important factors, which are unique to latticed structures, are considered.
