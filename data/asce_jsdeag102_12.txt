AB - A brief review of steel-deck-reinforced floor systems and resulting failure modes is presented, followed by the development and evaluation of design equations for one-way shear-bond capacity. A linear regression of pertinent strength parameters was utilized to fit potential design equations to experimental data. Results of three of several possible equations are given; these are based on parameter grouping from 353 specimens of various types tested at Iowa State University and 151 proprietary tests conducted by steel-deck manufacturers. Example regression plots pertaining to slab elements for six different steel deck configurations were developed. Effects of shoring and gage thickness are considered. The preferred design equation was obtained from a relationship for shear design in the 1971 ACI Building Code.

AB - Live-load data obtained from a survey of 23 office buildings located in various regions throughout the United States are presented. The buildings ranged in height from two stories to 49 stories. Data for government and private office buildings are included. Statistical summaries of the data are presented and the effects of various factors such as building height, building age, geographic location, room use, and room size are considered. A mathematical model expressing the relationship between the live load in offices and the significant factors affecting the load magnitude is also presented. The data presented may be used to evaluate current requirements for design loads for buildings and also for research studies of load effects in buildings.

AB - With the construction of the Saylorville Dam and Reservoir on the Des Moines River in Iowa, six highway bridges were scheduled for removal. Two of these were incorporated into a comprehensive test program to study the behavior of old pin-connected high-truss single-lane bridges. The test program consisted of ultimate load tests, service load tests, and a supplementary static and fatigue testing program of selected members. The results reported in this paper cover the service load tests on the two bridges as well as the supplementary tests, both static and fatigue, of eyebar members taken from the two bridges at the time of removal. The field test results of the service loading are compared with theoretical results of the truss analysis.

AB - An earthquake design criteria developed for bridges in California is presented. The criteria considers the proximity of maximum credible seismic events, local soil conditions, dynamic structural characteristics, ductility, and risk. The rationale for development of a flexible criteria which permits future revisions is given. The development of a map of maximum bedrock accelerations for California is examined. The development of response spectra at the bedrock level based on actual recorded events is presented. A method for considering the effects of soils at a site is developed and incorporated into the criteria. Four sets of soil curves are shown to represent the majority of bridge sites in California. The rationale behind the ductility and risk reductions for modern California bridges is described. Recent dynamic analysis applications and approximate methods of analysis are presented, as well as future directions of seismic bridge design.

AB - Results are reported of a model study conducted on the shear strength of two-way bridge slabs. The models represented, to varying scale, a hypothetical 80-ft (24.4-m) long two-lane two-girder bridge, consisting of three square slabs in the longitudinal direction. It is shown that model scale has no effect on shear strength, provided that appropriate nondimensional slab parameters and actual slab dimensions are used. A reliable method is presented for predicting the shear strength of two-way slabs. This method takes into account the enhancement of slab strength due to in-plane (compressive membrane) stresses. Rules for assessing this enhancement are given. Effects on slab shear strength due to dead load stresses, boundary conditions, and reinforcement and concrete properties, are presented.

AB - The procedure appropriate for regions where available wind data are representative of the strong wind climate, as is in regions where extreme winds are due mainly to large-scale weather systems. Recently a study of a major building proposed for New Orleans prompted an extension of the methods to consider effects of rare events such as hurricanes. A Monte Carlo simulation of tropical cyclones was used to generate a series of storms having statistically representative values of intensity, size, and translational motion. In a case study of the building planned for New Orleans, the time history of the wind speed and direction obtained at the structure during the simulations was translated into pressure using measured aerodynamic data. Statistics of extreme pressures were examined and compared to those obtained from predictions based on available local wind observations. The study indicates that hurricane winds generally dominate the forecast for long recurrence intervals.

AB - In an earlier paper, a method was presented for the simplified analysis of frame-tube structures under bending actions. By replacing the discrete structure by an equivalent orthotropic tube, and by making simplifying assumptions regarding the stress distributions in the structure, design curves were derived for rapid approximate analysis of the dominant behavior. A similar analysis is presented in this paper for the torsional analysis of frame-tube structures. Closed-form solutions are obtained and design curves are developed for three standard torsional loading cases, corresponding to those considered in the bending analysis, i.e., a point torque at the top, and uniformly and triangularly distributed twisting moments, Design curves are found to be identical in form to those derived for the bending case.
