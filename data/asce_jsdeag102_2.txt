AB - Standards should optimize for society. This is approximately accomplished by minimizing the sum of expected present values of initial cost and losses due to failure (entrance into limit states), maintenance, and disutility caused by reduction in users' well-being. On this basis a general theory of standards optimization is developed, applicable to any kind of products, assuming that the least expensive variant satisfying the standards will be purchased (or the contract awarded to the lowest bidder) and recognizing random price fluctuations. A simpler version is applied to rolled steel shapes, especially I-beams. Initial cost is taken as containing a term proportional to cross-sectional area and one due to wear of rollers. Expected failure loss is computed for different safety factors. This leads to computation of optimum tolerances on cross-sectional area. Results indicate that present practice may be too conservative. A more refined analysis is suggested.

AB - A basis for fracture safe bridge design is examined. The relative roles that fatigue and fracture play in overall bridge design are examined from a fracture mechanics viewpoint. The methods available for measuring the fracture toughness of bridge steels are indicated with their potential as quality control tests for adequate steel toughness examined. It is generally concluded that current steels provide adequate fracture toughness in most design situations.

AB - A nonlinear constitutive model for plain concrete subjected to cyclic biaxial stresses is described in brief. The model takes account of the compressive softening of concrete prior to reaching maximum compressive stress. Two reinforced concrete shear wall structures, one loaded monotonically and the second subjected to large cyclic load reversals are analyzed and compared with test data. Simulation of cyclic loading response is greatly improved compared to previous elastoplastic models. In addition to the improved material characterization in compression, the treatment of tensile cracking is felt to be a significant factor in the good match obtained with experimental data.

AB - The wind pressure distribution and dynamic behavior of hyperbolic cooling towers are significantly different from those of simple slender structures. Therefore, the gust response factors developed for design of these simple structures may not be applicable to cooling towers. A method which considers the dynamic interaction of the wind and tower is presented to obtain the gust factors for cooling tower design. Wind pressure distribution measurements made on model towers in wind tunnels are used. Simplifying assumptions are made concerning the correlation characteristics of wind pressure on a tower surface. Effect of change in wind and tower parameters on gust factors is examined.

AB - The purpose of the research in this paper was to determine material behavior and strength characteristics of concrete materials, by studying stochastically the random-type acoustic emission patterns and intensities that emanate from concrete during loading. The concrete specimens used for this purpose are standard concrete cylinders made up from specific concrete mixtures with definite material properties and strength characteristics. The first objective in this research was to develop an experimental setup and recording system that is capable of recording the waveform patterns and intensities of these acoustic emissions. The second objective was to develop a methodology that will establish the relationship of these emissions with general material behavior of concrete mixtures, as well as their relationship to specific concrete properties. Suggestions are also included here about the types of concrete problems that can be approached by using this method.

AB - The purpose of this paper is to present a theory and procedure for the optimization of unstiffened hybrid and homogeneous I-beams considering shear and moment at the same time. Using a correction factor in the web contribution to the section modulus, a simple unreduced flange stress can be used without iterating with respect to the ratio of web area versus flange area. The end result consists of a uniform I-beam, with all the dimensions uniquely determined, fully stressed in bending and shear, also achieving minimum cost in materials. Applications of the theory are presented and several examples showing the savings are included.

AB - Generally, the analyses used to determine the distribution of bending moments and internal forces in a structure are first-order analyses. Such analyses neglect the so called P-Δ effects: (the effects produced by the vertical forces acting through the laterally deflected position of the structure). Thus, the stiffness and strength of the structure is overestimated. In an attempt to compensate for these shortcomings, the present design procedure requires increases in the column sizes in a sway permitted structure. As an alternative, a method for directly including the P-Δ moments in the analysis of the structure is presented. It is shown that if such an analysis is used, the members in both braced and unbraced structures may be designed as sway prevented.

AB - A finite element analysis of a tank supported on columns attached to the shell wall is conducted based on an analytical model of the system. The effectiveness of a radial stiffener on reducing the design forces is demonstrated and the mechanism of axial load transfer between the columns and the shell is investigated. Also the distribution of the important design forces away from the column center line is considered.

AB - In design, earthquakes are often idealized as having a single horizontal component which can act in two orthogonal directions. The present note examines the influence of other components. Free-field motion is taken as having two horizontal translational and three rotational components and is averaged over the building.s base. Soil-structure interaction is otherwise ignored. Vertical translation is not dealt with because the present building idealization does not lend itself. In the absence of adequate records, ground motion is assumed to coincide with theoretical solutions for regular homogeneous formations. The building is idealized as linear, uniform, and admitting shearing and torsional deformations.
