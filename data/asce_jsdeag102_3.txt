AB - Allowance is made in the analysis for the effects of the residual stresses produced by welding and sections fabricated from both Universal Mill (UM) plates and flame cut (FC) plates are considered. Early yielding of the beam's web is shown to have little effects upon lateral stability, the stiffness of the compression flange being the most important factor. For a constant weld size, hybrid sections and sections fabricated from the flange material throughout are found to have very similar lateral buckling strengths. Plotting the results on an equivalent lateral-torsional slenderness ratio basis actually causes the hybrid sections' curve to be the highest. Use of this technique also minimizes the effect of variations in cross-sectional shape although the level of residual stresses in the sections remains an important parameter. Sections fabricated from FC plates are found to possess slightly differently shaped lateral buckling curves to sections fabricated from UM plates.

AB - Limit states design (in a load factor-performance format) is an option in the 1975 National Building Code of Canada. The code specifies one set of load factors common to all technologies: steel, wood, reinforced concrete, etc. The paper describes the method used to determine the appropriate performance factors (α-factors) for use in cold-formed steel design and embodied in the CSA Standard 8136-1974. Two methods were used independently. The deterministic method was designed to yield the same weighted average safety factor as the given working stress version of the standard. The probabilistic method was designed to minimize the weighted mean square error in the safety index vector from a target vector of safety indices. The results agree for the basic case of yielding limit states.

AB - In the P? method of design, the secondary forces, produced by the vertical loads acting through the laterally displaced shape of the structure, are included directly in the analysis. This approach removes the artificial distinction between a braced and an unbraced structure, which is implied by the present K factor design approach to columns, and leads to a more rational technique for the design of columns and bracing systems. The PΔ technique does imply, however, that the maximum strength of a beam-column can be reached regardless of the magnitude of the sway rotation of the member. For beam-columns in flexible structures, or those subjected to high axial loads, the usable strength is less than the maximum strength of the member in the sway prevented condition. A limitation on the drift will avoid structural arrangements for which this strength reduction is significant.

AB - A method is presented for computing the nonlinear dynamic response of three-dimensional cable-stiffened structures. The nonlinear dynamic equations are reduced to a smaller system by expanding the unknown variables as a series of mode shapes which were found by an eigenvalue analysis of the linear dynamic equations. The method is applied to a single plane cable-stayed bridge. Results are obtained for linear and nonlinear dynamic response due to earthquake, vortex excitation, and wind gusting. It is confirmed that a linear analysis is suitable for cable-stayed bridges.

AB - Various failure hypotheses for wall panels subjected simultaneously to diagonal compressive load and to vertical compressive edge load are compared with the results of 32 tests on four types of brick masonry walls which were published elsewhere. It is concluded that failure can occur by joint separation or by splitting. A failure hypothesis is advanced which is shown to be in good agreement with the test results examined.

AB - Little guidance is available to the building designer to indicate the possible or probable existence of increased cladding wind loadings resulting from nearby structures or to indicate when model tests should be performed to quantify such effects. To provide information on this problem, one case of increased wind loading on a cylindrical building caused by adjacent structures has been documented by means of wind-tunnel model tests. The results of this investigation are presented and general guidelines defining geometrical conditions which may lead to increased wind loading are stated.

AB - Tests were conducted on eight 1/2-scale models of reinforced concrete interior flat plate-column connections transferring shear and unbalanced moment from gravity and simulated seismic loading. The slab at the connection contained either no shear reinforcement or shear reinforcement in the form of either cranked bars, structural steel shearhead or closed vertical stirrups. The simulated seismic loading was statically applied, either monotonically or cyclically in the inelastic range. The strength and ductility of the connections, and the modes of failure, were compared. The connections without shear reinforcement failed suddenly in diagonal tension. The use of cranked bars as shear reinforcement increased the strength of the connection but did not increase the ductility. The use of a structural steel shearhead resulted in an increase in strength and in a limited increase in ductility. The use of closed vertical stirrups around the slab bars, which passed through the column, resulted in an increase in the strength and in a substantial increase in the ductility of the connection.

AB - Methods of modifying a program written for the standard stiffness method to account for the nonlinearity introduced by cable action and axial compression, or both, are shown. For the case of axial compression, a member is divided into a number of divisions. Standard stiffness method is used but secondary effects due to axial compression on deflected geometry are taken into account. Two examples are shown. The method can be applied to members of variable cross section and with axial forces distributed along the member. For the case of cables, a modified modulus of elasticity method is used. The method differs from that introduced by Tung in that cable tension is solved directly from the nonlinear cable equation and unbalanced forces due to differences between the curved cable and the substituted straight member are taken into account. Comparison of the results by the proposed method with those by a more exact iteration method are given for two examples involving interaction of cable and compression members. Finally, solution of a transmission tower with cable members is illustrated.

AB - The main purpose of codes should be producing optimum structures. Within one plausible system of ethics one should optimize for all of society, including future generations, taking into account protection of property, not only of life. Wide uncertainties demand use of probability theory, particularly Baysian statistics. Limit-states design, split factors, characteristic values, semiprobabilistic codes, and second-moment formats approximate reliability levels design. This familiarizes engineers with probability theory but overemphasizes influence of uncertainties and of statistical correlation and does not reflect the economic framework. Intuitive adjustments of reliability levels are unsatisfactory. Advent of optimization codes should be accelerated. A strategy for code evolution comprises education, production of design aids, flexibility in format, and research into statistics of human error and workings of intuition.

AB - A method to optimize the weight of plane frames subjected to dynamic loads is presented. Various considerations for rigid frame design include damping, the P? effect, static girder loads, static column loads and girder shears transferred to the columns. A finite difference approach is presente to evaluate a shock spectrum which is used in conjunction with modal superposition to obtain the peak upper bound dynamic displacements and stresses for multistory and multibay frames. The displacement method is used for the structural matrix formulation from which the optimization process is shown in relation to the change of the design variables in the condensed stiffness matrix. A direct, nonlinear mathematical programming method of feasible directions is used to minimize the weight of the structure subject to the aforementioned linear and nonlinear constraints. Several applications of the proposed method are presented to show the design process related to the active constraints and the significant effects of various considerations on optimum design.

The basic structural element is a full-size plate (finite panel) having eight degrees-of-freedom. A Levy-type displacement function is employed in series fashion. Transverse loads are modeled by nodal line forces derived by enforcing reciprocal energy equivalence. Performance of the model is compared with conventional finite element solutions.

AB - E–rating (measuring modulus of elasticity) and tension proof loading of lumber before laminating could improve stiffness characteristics and allowable design stresses for glued–laminated timber beams. Twenty–four large southern pine beams were fabricated from E–rated lumber–the high–E material located on the outside and low–E material in the core. Although average beam strength of southern pine equals Douglas fir, southern pine responds differently to tension proof loading than does Douglas fir. Southern pine may require higher proof loads (1.5 × beam Fb) than Douglas fir (1.3 × Fb) to eliminate brash pith–associated wood from the critical tension laminations. Since proof load breakage with southern pine was significantly less than with Douglas fir, a higher proof load stress for southern pine could be tolerated without causing excessive loss from breakage. Static beam modulus of elasticity is predictable from the E of the laminations with a correlation coefficient of 0.982.

Load-deflection curves are plotted for example frames, together with plots showing the degeneration of load factors as plasticity spreads. The technique uses concepts of initial strain and tangent stiffness and solves the eigenvalue problem associated with the elasto-plastic structure using stability functions and an automatic search procedure. The entire analysis is automated for use in an interactive computer package.

AB - The analysis of beam-columns on continuous elastic foundations is required for applications in systems as diverse as a nail embedded in wood, laterally braced beam-columns, bearing piles, or beams on soil foundations. In addition, related problems such as a network of beams on soil foundations. In addition, related problems such as a network of beams, stiffened thin-walled tubes, ribbed plates, or ribbed shells all have a mathematical form identical to that of the beam-column on elastic supports. For these cases it is sometimes necessary to obtain not only a deflection and stress analysis but a stability analysis as well. The purpose of this paper is to present Fourier series analysis techniques for performing the elastic stability analysis of beam-columns supported by continuous Winkler supports including arbitrary rotational and translational restraints at the boundaries. As a byproduct of the stability analysis, the deflection analysis for general loadings will also be generated.
