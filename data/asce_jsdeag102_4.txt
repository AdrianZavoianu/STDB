AB - Present methods for the design of laterally unbraced steel I-beams are reviewed, and the need for improvements in the treatment of beams of intermediate slenderness is demonstrated. A simple method, which makes due allowance for the type of loading, of estimating the inelastic buckling load of a single span beam is proposed. A design curve is proposed which makes use of the fully plastic moment and either the elastic or the inelastic critical moment. The position of this curve is determined by using available test data. This approach is more consistent than previous methods, particularly in the inelastic range where better allowance is made for the type of loading. A method of dealing with the interaction between adjacent segments of laterally continuous beams that buckle in the inelastic range is also proposed. Comparisons show that the method gives conservative results that are more accurate than those of existing approximate methods.

AB - Certain shortcomings of current procedures for computing alongwind structural response have been shown to result in unrealistic estimates of tall building behavior under the action of strong winds. Differences between predictions of fluctuating response based on various such procedures have been shown to be in certain cases as high as 200%. The purpose of the present work is to present a procedure for calculating alongwind response, including deflections and accelerations, which incorporates these advances. The meteorological and aerodynamic models on which the procedure is based are described in brief. The practical use of the procedure is illustrated in a numerical example. Estimates are provided of errors inherent in the models employed. The range of applicability of the procedure is defined, and it is indicated that for structures with unusual modal shapes or for which the influence of higher vibration modes is significant, a recently developed computer program should be employed in lieu of the procedure presented herein.

AB - A method, based on the theorem of minimum total potential, is proposed for the analysis of nonorthogonal grids subjected to a set of static, horizontal forces arbitrary in magnitude and direction. Effects of interaction resulting from unsymmetrical bending of columns common to nonorthogonal intersecting frames are duly taken into account. Shear walls may be included in the analysis. Stiffness matrices of the individual stiffness elements and a matrix comprising the force set are utilized as basic input information. The method ultimately results in a system of linear algebraic equations from which translational (u, v), and rotational (φ) displacements of the rigid floor plates are determined. Subsequently, translational and flexural deformations of the stiffness elements are computed, from which stress resultants may be determined. Part one covers the formulation of the method of analysis through the development of equilibrium, compatibility, and force (moment) deformation relationships for subsequent utilization according to the minimum total potential theorem. In part two, a numerical application is presented.

AB - Plywood exposed for more than 21 yr to continuous weathering and use as the roof decking of portable hog houses was found to have strength properties comparable to those expected in new plywood. Tests of 10 panels in flexure, rolling shear, and shear-through-the-thickness, conducted according to ASTM standards, showed the weathered plywood to have structural properties sufficient to justify use of the currently published design stresses. Comparison of bending properties of specimens with weathered face ply intact with specimens in which the weathered face ply had been removed suggested no significant degradation due to weathering.

AB - Cold-formed steel panels are used as wall sheathing, roof decking, or floor decking in steel framed buildings. Diaphragms formed by interconnecting these panels have considerable in-plane shear resistance, and can be utilized as bracing against buckling for individual members of a steel frame. The utilization of existing floor or roof diaphragms as bracing for individual beams can eliminate the need for other types of bracing, and reduce required member sizes, or both, thus contributing to economical design. A procedure is presented for the design of I-section beams with diaphragm bracing on either the tension or compression flanges. The procedure is based on the ultimate load capacity of fully braced members, utilizing a conservative estimate of the shear strength and shear rigidity of the diaphragm. A design example is included.

AB - The behavior of the structure is assumed to be described by a finite element model. Several techniques for computing static response of modified structures are available in literature. These are initial strain concept of reanalysis, techniques based on the Sherman-Morrison identity, some general techniques of structural modifications, Taylor series approach, iterative techniques, reduced basis methods, and some other techniques. Some new approaches based on the reduced basis method are tried and their results are summarized. For frequency response of modified structures three basically different techniques are available. In the first one, modifications to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed directly by using Taylor series expansion. In the second one, locally modified systems are treated in an exact manner, and in the third technique component mode substitution methods are viewed as reanalysis methods.

AB - The analysis of foam-filled sandwich panels with light gage, cold-formed metal faces is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Moments and shears affecting the core and those arising from the bending of the rigid faces are combined in the theory. Formulated as an ordinary second order differential equation, and using boundary conditions, expressions are developed for deflection and for flexural stresses in the faces and shear stresses in the core. Experimentally, four different sandwich panels were subjected to uniform loading on simple spans. Strain gages and deflection dials were used. Experimental and theoretical deflections and stresses are in reasonable agreement. Both approaches show a reversal of stresses along the profiles of the formed faces due to bending of such faces about their own centroidal axis, which indicates a plane section of such sandwich panel does not remain plane under bending. The theory is applicable to panels with either one or two formed face(s) and faces of different or the same materials. In case there is only one formed face, the other face is flat.

AB - A major maintenance cost associated with timber construction is the repair of structural members in which checking, cracking, and splitting have occurred, in particular, near bolted joint connections. The use of pressure injected epoxy to repair damaged timber connections has potential as a viable alternative to current repair procedures. To investigate the structural behavior of epoxy-repaired timber connections, a series of experimental studies were conducted to determine: (1) Epoxy-to-wood bond characteristics; and (2) behavior of epoxy-repaired bolted timber connections. Bond tests in both tension and shear showed that the epoxy-to-wood bond is at least as high as the allowable stress in the timber. Tension and bending tests of simple bolted joint connections were even more significant. Using a procedure of loading a defect-free joint to failure, repairing the joint by the epoxy injection method, and reloading the joint to failure, it was found that a 30%-60% increase in strength is obtained, and the stiffness of the joint is increased.

AB - The helicoidal girder has gained popularity as a structural member in staircases and bridges during the last decade. Analyses of this type of girder have been presented by Bourdin, Fuchssteneir, Holmes, Schneider, and Yound and Scordelis. In this paper, the analysis of helicoidal girder is based on the cylindrical helix. The helix is analyzed as the shortest curve between two fixed points on a cylinder.s surface. If a cylinder is cut vertically and expanded, the helix will project as an inclined line with an angle, in the plane.
