AB - The results of the program are derived from 23 uniaxial tension tests on specimens measuring 36 x 4 x 0.5-in. to 1.5-in. thick (914 x 102 x 13-mm to 38-mm) and from 25 compression tests on 11.5 x 4 x 4-in. (292 x 102 x 102-mm) columns, half mortar throughout and half with a 11.5 x 2.5 x 2.5-in. (292 x 102 x 102-mm) polystyrene core. Variables include the type, amount, strength, and orientation of the reinforcement. In uniaxial tension, the results for two types of expanded metal and one of welded wire mesh show expanded metal to be superior from the point of view of strength, stiffness, and crack development. In compression, welded mesh is much superior because expanded metal is rendered completely ineffective as lateral reinforcement by its tendency to undergo a scissors action under axial load. Geometry and orientation of the reinforcement are mainly responsible for the major differences in performance observed for both tension and compression.

AB - The concept of load factor analysis (LFA) is new to the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges. In order to provide for a uniform and consistent future development of the Specifications, the principles of the LFA philosophy should be stated and maintained. The current specifications and the proposed revisions can then be reviewed or formulated for consistency to a stated philosophy. A philosophy for LFT has not been formally stated outside of the written AASHTO material and load design specifications. An attempt is made to glean a generalized, philosophy statement of LFA. Some current problems are presented that are believed to be a result of the lack of a formal statement. Problems presented are in the areas of current specifications and proposed specification revisions, and developing the specifications to meet actual load conditions.

AB - In recent years, mill building owners and constructors world-wide have observed structural distress in welded crane runway girders. The distress is in the form of fatigue cracks in the vicinity of the juncture of the web and top flange. Structural analyses were made using finite element and classical methods in order to rationally explain the observed cracks and to develop new fatigue-resistant details. The results of the analyses confirmed that the local stresses produced by the passage of concentrated wheel loads were sufficient to cause fatigue cracks in the presently used structural details. It was concluded that the fatigue cracks were caused by the local effects of the crane wheel loads and the high stress range that occurs due to lack of proper bearing between the stiffeners and flange when a fitted stiffener is used. Therefore, an improved fatigue resistant detail was developed which consists of stiffeners with a deep cope (10-in., 254-mm) welded to the underside of the top flange with full penetration welds.

AB - The simple shakedown theory that employs the assumptions of plastic design is extended to beams which are continuous over elastic springs. It is shown that support settlement has an influence on the shakedown load but that shakedown still occurs. The stiffness of the elastic spring is included in the analysis. An example is worked to indicate the use of the theory and shows that the shakedown load falls between the load at the limit of elastic action and the fully plastic load.

AB - Sixteen fixed-ended steel bars of rectangular cross section 1/2 in. x 1 (12.7 x 25.4-mm) and (12.7-mmand of various lengths were tested under 25.4-mm) nder static and dynamic loads to determine the cyclic hysteretic response of steel columns. The specimens were subjected to tensile yielding, post-buckling deflection cycles. Column slenderness ratios ranged from 85 to 210. This research complemented a corresponding elasto-plastic theoretical development; the experimental results generally agreed with theoretical predictions, yet significant deviations were noted. Principal findings were that the buckling load decreased with number of cycles, the columns exhibited net tensile or compressive plastic deformation in a cycle depending on deflection level, and the static and dynamic responses were similar.

AB - The parametric motions considered are very general and may be due to mechanical vibrations or horizontal and vertical components of earthquakes. A computer program has been developed for the nonlinear dynamic response of structural systems which are formulated in incremental form based on the displacement method and numerical integrations. Numerical examples are provided from which one may observe that the structure becomes dynamically unstable when a certain frequency of vertical motion is present and that the growth of the vibrating amplitude may possibly cause lateral collapse of the system. Although no definite relationship between vertical earthquake frequencies and the lateral natural frequencies exists for an earthquake structure, the vertical earthquake motions can excite some structures having certain natural frequencies becoming dynamically unstable due to large deflections. The vertical force may not always be critical to dynamic response and can actually cause certain structures to have smaller deflections than that of the associated systems without the influence of the axial force.

AB - The earthquake integrity of a new type of multistory building, referred to as suspended-floor high rise, is investigated. In these structures floors are supported by steel tension elements called hanger straps which are draped over the end walls of two reinforced concrete core towers. Limited-capacity connecting elements called bumper bars couple the motions of the suspended floors and the supporting core towers. A three-dimensional analytical model and pertinent dynamic analysis techniques are presented. Finite element representations of the core towers are incorporated into substructure models which feature all basic components of the system. The model is assembled using series elimination, and the linear dynamic response to several earthquake loadings is provided to illustrate structure behavior. Dynamic testing performed at the site of two existing suspended-floor buildings produced natural frequencies and damping values. Comparison of measured and computer-generated frequencies demonstrates the validity of the analytical model.

AB - A time-history analysis of an elastic structure subjected to an earthquake can be computationally expensive due to the complexity and time duration of the earthquake. A response spectrum analysis of the structure can also be complex because the natural frequencies and mode shapes must be obtained and then the modal responses must be added together in some probabilistic manner. Previously generated artificial earthquakes typically consist of random oscillatory motion of significant time duration. In this work, an analytic earthquake consisting of variable frequency sinusoidal motion is used. The short time duration and the smooth response spectrum of the sine sweep lead to computational efficiency. It is demonstrated that the sine sweep earthquake, applied to an elastic structure, gives results that agree with those obtained using an actual earthquake. Furthermore, by varying the parameters of the sine sweep earthquake, various design spectra can be approximated. The sine sweep earthquake is shown to give consistent modal participation and therefore a time-history analysis using this short duration analytic earthquake can be confidently employed.

AB - A 1:64 scale section model of a recently constructed suspension bridge was tested in smooth and turbulent flow with and without an upstream obstacle. Testing was limited to determination of aerodynamic damping on a model confined to single-degree-of-freedom torsional motion. The upstream obstacle selected was a 1:64 replica of a cable-stayed bridge (basically a flat plate on a narrower box). The truss model (without an obstruction) showed little change in response due to turbulence intensity typical of an elevated open site. The upstream model produced high turbulence intensity levels even in smooth flow. In so far as catastrophic torsion was concerned the cable-stayed bridge model actually shielded the truss model producing some effect to a streamwise spacing of 10 times the truss dimension. Caution must be used in application of these results since different designs may produce different results. With any upstream structure, non-catastrophic buffeting is a possibility, with increased turbulence intensities possibly producing difficulties in vehicle control.

AB - Using the techniques of discrete field analysis, the stability equation is obtained in a form independent of the number of sides in the polygon cross section. The stability equation was found to exhibit little numerical sensitivity enabling a simple step-wise incremental load procedure to be utilized for obtaining critical buckling loads. The stability equation is used to develop a series of curves for determining critical elastic buckling loads over a wide range of parameters. These curves should prove useful to designers in selecting the appropriate column configuration for their specific application. The analysis also verified that the use of the classical Euler buckling formula and the classical plate buckling formula in their respective ranges were good approximations for many cases. The primary exceptions were the triangular and pentagonal cross sections which exhibited significantly higher critical buckling loads, especially in the local buckling range.

AB - An appreciation of the forces exerted by the wind on the wall and roof cladding of buildings is necessary in order to obtain safe and yet economic design of cladding. A survey of wind damage that has occurred in the United Kingdom is used to reveal the nature and scale of the problem. Areas of buildings which are regularly damaged include the perimeter zones of low-pitch roofs, and the corners of walls of high-rise buildings. Wind pressures and suctions measured at numerous locations on the claddings of such buildings are used to quantify the problem, and it is concluded that the high local pressure coefficients used in wind loading codes of practice need revising to take account of the wind damage that continues to occur. It is also emphasized that account should be taken of the high forces that can develop on cladding during the construction of a building when a dominant opening temporarily remains on one face.

AB - Herein, wind is modeled as a planar multivariate stochastic process whose temporal and spatial correlation structure is specified from measured wind data. Wind forces are simulated in the time domain at specified floor levels of a tall building on the digital computer. The tall building is modeled as a planar multidegree-of-freedom system and its dynamic response to wind samples are obtained to yield displacement, velocity, acceleration, and rate of change of acceleration time histories. Response calculation by superposition of a finite number of normal modes illustrates participation of each and the effect of damping on each. The contribution of higher modes to the response is suggested to be significant for serviceability and human comfort. Even though strength and stability criteria are sufficiently calculable by the fundamental mode, the higher response parameters such as acceleration and the rate of change of acceleration have significant contributions from the higher modes and could be important factors in the assessment of human awareness levels and serviceability criteria.

The procedure involves a modal analysis in each cycle. It converges rapidly if the design velocity spectrum increases with period in the neighborhood of the fundamental period and it can be adapted to cases in which the spectrum decreases in this range. The quid of the proposed approach is to insure at least one active restriction per story.

AB - Critical loads and the corresponding reactions, maximum moments, and crown deflections of two-hinged and fixed, parabolic and circular arches of constant cross section subjected either to a vertical concentrated load at the crown or a vertical load uniformly distributed along the arch axis are tabulated for a wide range of rise/span ratios. It is shown that the critical loads and the corresponding horizontal reactions for antisymmetrical (sidesway) modes are rather insensitive to the prebuckling displacements while the opposite is true for the symmetrical models. The antisymmetrical mode corresponds to a bifurcation type instability while the symmetrical mode corresponds to a snap-through type of buckling. The data are analyzed and simplified methods for estimating the critical loads and the critical horizontal reactions, or both, are suggested for antisymmetrical buckling. In addition to the solutions described previously, accurate values of the critical loads and horizontal reactions are reported for antisymmetrical buckling of two-hinged and fixed, parabolic and catenary arches subjected to loadings which cause pure axial compression and no prebuckling displacements.

Static loads were applied at midspan to cause a complex pattern of membrane and bending stresses with the effects of diaphragms clearly evident. Experimental results in typical cases are shown graphically and compared to the results of a special purpose finite element program developed especially for curved box analysis. Good agreement between experimental and analytical results were obtained.

On the basis of these analyses, extensive numerical results are presented for the overall shearing stiffness and typical results are presented for the maximum extreme-fiber transverse flexural strains which accompany the shearing of such plates. In the case of type (d) attachments typical numerical data are also presented for the tension in the attachments due to the prying action exerted by the rigid flange as it interferes with the deformation of the ends of the corrugations. The results for stiffness are compared with those obtained by other investigators, on the basis of somewhat less precise theories and with experiments.

The classical circular plate stability problem involves solving a transcendental characteristic equation, including Bessel functions. The in-plane buckling load can be determined analytically for only a few simple plate configurations. A complex plate with varying sectional properties, in-span supports, foundations, or varying in-plane force requires a numerical technique.

AB - The pétry formula is widely used within the nuclear power industry for predicting missile penetration in soil and concrete. It is accepted by regulatory agencies and design professions, yet it is subject to considerable controversy as to its limitations and circumstances of usage. Also, it is often criticized because of its ultra conservatism in some cases compared to test data. Designers are also confused by the uncertainty of its origin and its theoretical bases. This paper deals with the historical aspect of the Pétry formula and hopefully contributes to an improved understanding of penetration formulas in general. The Pétry formula was evolved from the Poncelet formula. The modified Pétry formula is an improved version of the original Pétry formula.
