AB - Professional societies recommend and courts, laws and governmental regulations require consideration of environmental impact statements for larger projects affecting the natural and man-made environment. Yet beauty in civil engineering design is rare in the midst of much that is dreary, expressionless, and unartistic. Reasons and proposed remedies for this are presented. Recent research leading to the development of a rational design methodology is briefly surveyed. Governmental concern and regulation for esthetics in civil works is considered, an action program is recommended, and 34 references are cited.

AB - The bond between steel fibers and portland cement matrices is a critical factor in determining the strength properties of fiber-reinforced concrete structural elements. The influence of the following three major parameters on the pull-out behavior of fibers was studied: the angle of orientation of the fibers with the loading direction, the number of fibers being simultaneously pulled out from the same area, and the efficiency of random orientation. It is shown that: (1)The pull-out load of a randomly oriented fiber is not lower than that of an aligned fiber; (2)the pull-out capacity of a group of randomly oriented fibers decreases drastically when the number of fibers pulling out from the same area increases; and (3)the efficiency of fiber orientation after matrix cracking is substantially higher than efficiency factors derived from the theoretical elastic considerations. These results seem to explain why the addition to a concrete matrix of fibers with highly improved bond properties does not often lead to an equivalent improvement in the composite properties.

AB - A method of calculation of fire resistance of steel structures has been developed in France by the Technical Center for Steel Construction. The main parts of this method are the determination of critical temperature and heating-up behavior of steel structures. This second part is developed in detail. It takes into account the steel protection by dry, wet, form-fitting, or sprayed protecting materials, but not by intumescent paints. Flow charts make the use of theoretical calculations easier. Thermal properties of some well-known materials are listed.

AB - A series solution has been developed to analyze skew orthotropic plate structures subjected to uniform and concentrated (patch) loads. The analysis was verified and substantiated by tests on model structures. The influence of skew, the ratio of the flexural rigidities, and torsional stiffness on the design quantities of such structures are investigated. The load-carrying capacity of orthotropic plate structures versus isotropic ones is compared. A design example is given using the charts presented.

AB - Dynamic programming or recursive optimization is especially useful for multistage processes in which decisions taken at one stage do not effect the previous stages. Dynamic programming is ideally suited for sequential decision processes, such as structural design, involving variables changing at discrete, irregular increments. The theory and computational details of dynamic programming for designing optimum structures is presented herein. The method is illustrated by applying it to the optimum profile design of an extra high voltage transmission tower. The nodal positions, arrangement and type of bracings, and leading dimensions are all treated as variables subject to appropriate constraints. The result is the optimum shape of the tower and arrangement of members. The method can be used for multistory buildings.

AB - An approximate method of analysis based upon the replacement of planar trussed members by analogous prismatic I-beams in double layer diagonal grids is examined. The goemetrical properties of the analogous I-beams are, in each case, derived from those of the planar trussed members. The results of an approximate analysis, in which the analogous I-beams are considered to have both flexural and shear rigidity, but no torsional rigidity, are compared with those of an analysis in which the planar trussed members are considered to be constructed from an assembly of members, having axial rigidity only. It is shown that the approximate analysis in most cases is reasonably accurate and that consideration of shear rigidity consistently leads to an improvement in the results.

AB - The behavior of beam-to-column connections in composite rigid frames is examined and the results of tests on ten specimens are presented. The steel beams are connected to concrete slabs by welded studs and are subjected to negative moment. The columns are of encased I-section bent about the major axis. The steel core components are attached with typical welded connections. It is shown that effective composite action can be realized in the beam at the inner face of exterior columns. The rotation capacity at the column face is generally satisfactory and is limited by buckling of the compression flange. The column encasement is effective in assisting the core web to resist the connection shear force. With proper design of slab and encasement, the ultimate moment capacity can be almost doubled as compared with that of the bare steelwork.

AB - Circular buildings and elevated water tanks usually consist of polygon shaped space frames having vertical columns and horizontal beams arranged in the shape of regular polygon. For maximum effectiveness against lateral loading the minor axis of columns should be in the tangential direction of the circumscribing circle. The study is based on the stiffness method developed by Renton except that the effect of gusset plates is neglected for simplicity. In addition, a method is developed such that the effective length may be determined approximately by considering a single elastically supported column using the alinement chart given.
