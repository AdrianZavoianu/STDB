AB - A 1:64 scale model of the William Preston Lane, Jr., Memorial Bridge was studied in the wind tunnel to determine possible downstream effects on a parallel structure. The model was tested in smooth flow and in a grid-induced turbulent flow with the model held rigidly and also in a mounting allowing torsional oscillation. A 3.1 to 1 box member was also tested in rigid configuration only. For the stationary truss model in turbulent flow, at a downstream distance of about 10 bridge widths, the wake is random in nature with somewhat higher turbulence intensities. For the smooth flow, significant effects are still noticeable at a spacing of over 13 widths, the maximum distance tested. The same conclusions obtained for the box, although at greater spacings. For the oscillating model in turbulent flow, a small effect remains at maximum distance, while strong effects remain for smooth flow at the same location. Testing real problems in turbulent flow is recommended.

AB - Cylindrical and rectangular flat-bottomed liquid storage tanks subjected to horizontal earthquake excitations are studied. Formulas and curves that can be used to obtain bending and overturning moments are presented. Certain combination of earthquake response spectra and tank geometries produce maximum forces and moments when the tank is only partially full. The use of design curves in establishing this situation is illustrated. For slender tanks, an assumption made in present design practice is shown to lead to nonconservative results. The elimination of this assumption is shown to produce simplified expressions for the moments in these cases. Simplified expressions are also presented for use in estimating the maximum free surface displacement.

A computer program was developed and used to calculate the buckling load of four bridges with different types of cable configurations. An approximate method is suggested for the preliminary estimation of the lowest critical load. This approximate method yields very good results when it is applied to the examples in this paper.

AB - A procedure is presented for the design of I-shaped columns braced by diaphragms. The diaphragms can be formed, e.g., by interconnected cold-formed steel panels which are often used as wall sheathing for steel framed buildings. The diaphragms may be directly attached to one or both flanges of the columns, or connected to girts which in turn are connected to the columns. The procedure is based on the ultimate load capacity of fully braced members, utilizing a conservative estimate of the shear strength and shear rigidity of the diaphragm. Design examples are included. In many instances the existing wall sheathing provides adequate bracing against buckling. The method is similar to one proposed earlier for diaphragm-braced I-section beams.

AB - The relation is examined between risk of failure, degree of wind sensitivity, type of wind climate, and mean recurrence interval used in design. The results presented are based on the assumption, used in the ANSI A58.1 Standard, that the probabilistic behavior of extreme wind speeds is adequately modeled by distribution functions of the largest values, the parameters of which are estimated from the data consisting of the largest yearly wind speed for every year of record. These results show that a strong correlation exists between probability of failure and type of wind climate, as defined quantitatively by the parameters of the extreme wind distribution. All other relevant factors being equal, including the degree of sensitivity to wind, it was found that the probability of failure of a member may increase considerably as a function of type of wind climate. It is suggested that the effect of the type of climate, as defined in the paper, be taken into account in design.

AB - Comprehensive documentation damage has made it possible to estimate tornadic windspeeds from the analyses of structural failures, based on the damage of eight specific structural components. The reliability of the windspeed estimates depend on the complexity of the structural system involved. The more complex the structural system, the less reliable are the windspeed estimates. A free standing structure such as a light standard or chimney gives the best windspeed estimates whereas commercial buildings and residences give the least reliable values. Windspeed analyses of the tornadoes combined with evaluations of several previous windstorm incidents leads to: (1)Ground level windspeeds in most tornadoes are considerably less than 275 mph; (2)the appearance of damage does not correlate well with estimates of windspeeds that cause the damage; (3)wind rather than atmospheric pressure change is the principal damaging mechanism for conventional buildings; and (4)properly designed roof anchorages reduce damage to structures in tornadic winds.

AB - The statistical properties of fatigue strength of various types of weldments are analyzed from which the allowable fatigue stresses are computed. Results compare favorably with those of the AASHTO Fatigue Specifications (1973). The North Carolina 1972 vehicular traffic data are used to derive the statistical properties of vehicle type, weight, and traffic intensity. The information of fatigue strength and vehicular traffic are used to compute the probabilities of fatigue failure of weldments of two bridges, one narrow and the other of the wider variety, both designed according to the AASHTO Specifications (1973). Results show that the probability of failure values of the weldments of these two bridges differ drastically, the difference being attributable to the lateral load distribution factor recommended by the specifications. The manner in which the lateral load distribution factor may be revised so as to yield structures with desired but uniform reliability against fatigue failure is given.

AB - The data basis for the effective width expression used in cold-formed steel design is analyzed statistically. Several plausible effective width formulas are studied. It is concluded that the effective width is not significantly different for most test data on plates, beams, and columns in steel (including cold-formed and stainless steel), with the exception of specimens welded without stress relief. There is no significant dependence of the effective width on the flat width of partially effective flanges. A new reliability-based effective width formula is then proposed for design.

AB - Elastic and nonlinear dynamic analyses were performed on a coupled wall model based on the Banco de America building in Managua, Nicaragua. The general seismic behavior of coupled walls is examined, and the factors that must be considered in their design or repair are identified. Results of nonlinear dynamic analyses obtained for several accelerograms are compared with results of comparable static inelastic and dynamic elastic analyses. Three types of nonlinear behavioral characteristics were considered for the coupling girders: (1)Brittle shear failures; (2)ductile bilinear flexural yielding; and (3)ductile flexural yielding with stiffness degradation. Seismic response was very sensitive to the ground motion.Brittle girder failures had a detrimental effect on the lateral deflections. Improved behavior was obtained with ductile girders, but very large numbers of inelastic curvature reversals occurred in the girders due to higher mode effects, and very high girder shears and large fluctuations in the wall axial forces were developed.

AB - The shear stress distribution of tapered beams is investigated using a theory based on linear elasticity. The theory is applicable to wide flange or box tapered Hookean beams. Conventionally the shear stress distribution is assumed to be uniform with the external shear carried solely by the web. By the proposed theory significant shears are carried by the flanges. Based on the proposed theory a simplified analysis procedure is described. Simply calculate the vertical components of the flange flexural load and subtract and add them from the total vertical shear. The resulting shear is assumed to be carried by the web as a relatively uniform stress distribution. In comparison with the finite element analysis and the classical wedge theory close agreement was observed.

AB - In a recent report to the Ontario Precast Concrete Manufacturers Association, a firm of consulting engineers recommended the adoption of a new standard precast concrete trapezoidal box section bridge girder. This section is intended to replace standard I-section girders in spans of 100ft-150ft (30.5m to 45.8 m); and is being used for the first time in a proposed two-span continuous underpass structure. A 1/4.80 scale direct model study conducted on the negative moment region of the proposed structure is presented in this paper, particular emphasis being placed on the interface section between the precast girders and the in-situ concrete pier cap. Modeling criteria, materials, techniques and certain distortions allowed in the study are examined. Based on the study, a recommendation was made for the reduction of 11% in the level of longitudinal post-tensioning. Satisfactory performance of the prototype interface and pier cap sections can be expected under working and ultimate load conditions.

AB - Sporadic disturbances such as earthquakes and tornadoes are idealized as renewal processes. Uncertainties are classified according to their time correlation into disturbance, structure, and analyst random variables. Only the latter admit Bayesian updating. In this light a result due to Hasofer is revised. Structures are idealized as having a single degree-of-freedom and as having potential limit states in cascade, i.e., limit states can be entered only in a fixed order. Equivalent second-moment (beta method) criteria are developed. Treatment is then specialized to earthquake resistant design, in which disturbances are idealized as generalized Poisson processes. Explicit optimal-design formulas are given for this case. Appendices include novel second-moment approximate treatment of uncertainties not requiring calculation of derivatives. Those variables whose distributions are evidently close to Gaussian or lognormal are given a treatment that is exact for these types of distribution.

AB - A mathematical model describes properties of concrete under a two-dimensional state of stress. The effects of strain rate — the time rate of change of strain — on the mechanical properties are incorporated in the model. Appropriate assumptions are introduced in the model where experimental data were lacking; it was assumed, for example, that strain rate effects on mechanical properties of concrete under biaxial states of stress are identical to those revealed by uniaxial tests, because experimental data were available only for the latter case. Because no data were available for complete stress and strain reversals, the stress-strain curves in unloading and reloading where hypothesized in terms of the skeleton stress-strain curve. A method is developed for nonlinear analysis of response of concrete gravity dams to earthquake ground motion wherein mechanical properties of concrete are defined by the mathematical model mentioned. Each dam monolith is treated independently and idealized as an assemblage of two-dimensional finite elements.

AB - A stepwise linear elastoplastic analysis method, based on the wide column frame analogy, is presented for the analysis of coupled shear walls. Assuming the plastic hinge concept and a bilinear moment-rotation relationship for all members, the analysis enables the collapse load, load factor at each plastic hinge formation, and the ductility requirement of each hinge throughout the loading process, from working to ultimate load, to be determined. For any adopted practical limiting value of the ductility factor of the members, the analysis yields the corresponding maximum permissible applied load, the extent of plastification in the structure, and the amount of plastic rotation required at each story level in the plastified zone.

With a view to assessing the validity of current probabilistic approaches to the definition of design wind speeds, this technique was used in a study of extreme wind speeds based on records taken at 20 U.S. weather stations. The following results were obtained: (1)At 83% of the stations not susceptible to experiencing hurricane-force winds, the series of the largest annual wind speeds were well fit by Type I probability distributions of the largest values; (2)the assumption that Type II distributions with γ=9 are generally representative of such stations was not confirmed; (3)type I probability distributions do not appear to describe correctly the behavior of extreme winds in regions subjected to special winds, e.g., hurricanes; and (4)in such regions, 20-yr data samples may provide a misleading picture of extreme wind behavior.

AB - Theory is derived for the strength of reinforced concrete interior slab-column connections transferring shear and unbalanced bending moment. The slab at the connection may contain either no shear reinforcement or shear reinforcement in the form of either cranked bars, closed vertical stirrups, or a structural steel shearhead. A beam analogy is used which idealizes the slab as beams running in two directions at right angles into the column faces. The strength of the connection is obtained by summing the flexural, torsional, and shear capacities of the critical beam sections and the contribution from the shear reinforcement. The theory is compared with test results from several investigations and is demonstrated to give a better prediction of the ultimate unbalanced moment strength than the method of ACI 318-71. Yield line theory failure modes for the slab adjacent to the column are also analyzed to determine the upper limit of connection strength.

Ultimate loads have been computed using some of the methods available for the design of reinforced concrete wall elements; also a few other approaches have been examined and the computed values from all the methods compared with the test results.

The analysis includes complete interaction between plate and ribs, consideration of both membrane and flexural plate action, and flexible beam boundary rib supports on two opposite sides. A relatively simple transcendental equation is developed which can be numerically solved for critical buckling loads. The form and complexity of this equation is independent of the number of ribs in the system. Results show effects of various parameters on ribbed-plate stability.

AB - The boundary integral equation (BIE) method, with its origin in classical elasticity, has only in recent years been developed and used in structural mechanics. This method requires only boundary data, which reduces the dimension of the problem by one and relates boundary tractions and displacements through a system of integral equations. Through discretization and numerically, an algebraic system of equations is obtained and solved numerically. It appears that the BIE method has great potential in solving various structural problems alone, especially those with high stress gradients, or in conjunction with the finite element (FE) method. The purposes of this note are to apply the BIE method to some structural mechanics problems and to compare the results and efficiency with FE solutions.
