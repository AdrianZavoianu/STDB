AB - The problem of frame instability is not confined to tall and indeterminate frameworks. The problem is elucidated through an example of a three-hinged portal frame. The commonly accepted analysis of this frame is shown to be grossly unconservative. Several approximate and exact analyses are presented. They show that the essence of correct stability analysis is the proper accounting for load distribution within the frame under deformation. A simple test of this frame is described. Results confirm the analysis within the accuracy to be expected. It is concluded that there is a need for improved design aids to find the effective lengths of compression members in frames.

AB - To provide a basis for the development of interaction diagrams for round tubular beam-columns, a general purpose beam-column program is used to determine ultimate load capacities. A recursive technique is employed in association with moment-thrust-curvature data generated by an iterative solution for partially yielded cross sections. The program permits axial load, external end moments, or transverse loads to be incremented by a variable step procedure that is terminated at failure. It also provides the option of incorporating longitudinal residual stress patterns and nonlinear configuration of stress-strain relationships into the model. A comparison is made between interaction diagrams developed with and without considering residual stresses. Experimental data and analytical results are also compared, and reasonably close agreement between the predicted and measured values of ultimate capacities are observed.

AB - Sandwich panels with foamed cores and cold-formed metal faces are becoming more and more popular as building enclosures. It is not unusual that the temperature difference between the inside and outside wall surfaces may exceed 100°F. Experimentally, full-sized sandwich panels of different profiles were placed in a heat chamber in single and double spans. One side of the panel was subject to the heat flux generated in a heat chamber, whereas the other side was at room temperature. Special precaution was taken so that the temperature inside the heat chamber was uniform. Thermistors were used to detect the surface temperature of the panel. Strain and dial gages were also used. Formulated as an ordinary fourth-order differential equation, using suitable boundary conditions, expressions were derived for deflection, flexural stresses in the facings, and shear stresses in the core. Using the method of consistent deformations, similar expressions were derived for multiple spans.

AB - A higher-order triangular finite element is developed for the analysis of complex folded plate structures by combining a bending element whose normal displacement is represented as a restricted quintic polynomial with a membrane element whose in-plane displacements are represented as cubic polynomials. The discontinuities that occur along lines of plate intersections are minimized by setting forth various geometric and element force-displacement formulation criteria. To satisfy boundary conditions of the more complex plate structures, boundary constraint equations are developed and augmented to the stiffness equations. To show the applicability of the method, several examples of prismatic and nonprismatic folded plate structures are investigated and the resulting data compared with other theoretical and experimental data.

AB - The formulation of the bending and axial stiffness matrices for beams of tapering box and I-section using the solutions of the governing differential equations is presented for sections whose flanges and webs may be considered to be either thin or thick. The matrices were incorporated into a computer program for the accurate linear elastic analysis of plane structures that include such elements and which are subjected to both point and distributed loads. The accuracy of the elements is verified by comparison with a number of convergent solutions. The matrices are then used to analyse two practical structures, i.e., a pitched portal frame of tapering thin I-sections, and a bridge structure of both tapering thick box beams and tapering rectangular solid sections.

Extensive analyses are presented for the slip coefficients and slip behavior under cyclic loading for connections assembled with plain steel plates, corrosion resistant painted steel plates, or galvanized steel plates. Also, examinations of plain versus galvanized bolts and the turn-of-the-nut versus calibrated torque wrench methods of insulation are presented. Based on experimental results, recommendations are presented for the optimal design of high-strength bolted steel connections for the Alaskan type climatic environments.

AB - An experimental laboratory program was conducted to determine the damping characteristics of a composite girder at different strain levels and the effect of structural deterioration due to cyclic loading on these characteristics. The cyclic loading was imposed by means of a moving-mass closed-loop electrohydraulic actuator system. Five different methods were employed in the investigation to evaluate the equivalent linear viscous damping of the composite girder. The results show that strain level and structural deterioration have a considerable effect on the damping ratio. Initially, the damping ratio increased as the strain level increased. However, after the composite girder had incurred some structural deterioration, the damping ratio decreased as the strain level increased. All five of the different methods used to determine the damping ratio yield approximately the same value for the damping ratio and predict the same trends with regard to the strain level.

AB - A method for controlling the drift of tall buildings under lateral loads is suggested. It is based on utilizing the structural interaction between the frames and light wall panels. An elastic analysis of clad tall frames is developed, requiring little additional time to that required for the analysis of similar bare frames. The basic analysis is developed further into a simple approximate method whereby the stiffening effect of the partitions could be estimated. Two design examples of clad tall frames are included to explain the design procedure and check the validity of the proposed approximate method. The strength of clad frames is also examined. It is shown that even the lightest form of the wall panels add appreciably to the stiffness and strength of the frames in the completed buildings.

Realistic equivalent structural damping is determined and used in this analysis based on the actual building response data recorded during the San Fernando earthquake of 1971. Calculated upper bound motion responses on floors throughout the buildings are presented in terms of peak values of accelaration, velocity, and displacement. Envelopes of damped response spectra derived from the in-building accelerograms are also presented, and the use of these spectra is demonstrated with an illustrative example.

AB - The endochronic theory for inelasticity and failure, previously established, is used to predict the response of reinforced concrete beams in cyclic bending at large strains. Cross sections are assumed to remain plain and are subdivided in slices. Existing bending theories must be enhanced by inclusion of transverse normal strain as a third variable, in addition to curvature and transverse shear angle. The forces in stirrups bring concrete under confining hydrostatic pressure, and, according to endochronic theory, this greatly increases ductility and strength and suppresses strain-softening. The theory is applicable to any history of bending moment, shear force, and axial force, and allows the necessary cross-sectional area of stirrups to be calculated. It is most remarkable that a number of test data have been correctly predicted without having to adjust any of the material parameters determined previously from tests of plain concrete. The endochronic theory represents not merely a descriptive model, but a prediction method.

AB - The subject diaphragms are made from individual corrugated sheets which are connected to one another and to framing members with discrete fasteners. Failure of them under load is most commonly due to localized bearing or shear failure at the fasteners. The shear stiffness of the diaphragms depends greatly on the layout and number of fasteners. Formulas are derived for the shear stiffness and for the fastener forces in such diaphragms, which should be applicable where bolts, rivets, screws, or welds are used as discrete fasteners, and where the diaphragm loads are in the working range. The formulas are shown to agree quite well with the results of previous tests by the writer.

AB - An approximate method for the dynamic earthquake analysis of coupled shear walls within the framework of design response spectra is proposed. The first three modes of vibration are considered and the dynamic loading associated with each is assumed to be represented by the corresponding mode of a vibrating cantilever. Based on this approximation, the natural frequencies, deflection, internal forces and moments are computed and the design parameters of interest are presented in design chart form. A numerical example is worked out in detail to illustrate the use of the design charts. The contribution of higher modes is examined and the need to consider their effect is demonstrated.

AB - Imperfections of joint eccentricity and member initial curvature have an influence on the stresses developed in structural members. However, little attention has been given to the influence of these effects on the axial stiffness of members. The paper investigates two small examples that highlight possible consequences of changes of member stiffness. Force redistributions and significant changes in overall stiffness are shown to be possible. Attention is then drawn to possibly dangerous situations when structures, whose members have brittle-type strut characteristics, suffer these force redistributions.

AB - In modeling the fire response of reinforced concrete frame structures, the heat flow problem was separated from the structural analysis and two computer programs were written for solving the separate problems. Both programs account for the temperature dependence of the thermal and mechanical properties of materials; the structural analysis accounts for the degradation of concrete and steel through cracking, crushing, spalling, and yielding. FIRES-T (Fire Response of Structures — Thermal) evaluates the thermal response of reinforced concrete elements using a nonlinear finite element approach coupled with time step integration. Using the thermal histories predicted by FIRES-T, FIRES-RC (Fire Response of Structures — Reinforced Concrete Frames) evaluates the structural response of reinforced concrete frames by a nonlinear, direct stiffness method coupled with time step integration. An iterative approach is used within time steps to find deformed shapes which result in equilibrium between forces associated with external load and internal stresses and degradation.

AB - Several approximate methods are presently available for calculating deflections in castellated steel beams, yet, none is very accurate. Using Pippard.s approximate method of analysis of open-panel structures, Gardner was able to predict deflection to within 5% or better in several simply supported castellated beams; the method, however, involves laborious calculations. Recently, the finite element method has been utilized to calculate deflections in short castellated beams. Direct application to long castellated beams, however, in view of the large number of elements required to discretize the entire beam, is not practical. In this paper, the method of substructures is combined with the finite element to obtain deflections for long castellated beams.

The solution, basically a numerical procedure best effected by a digital computer, is reduced to two steps: 1) The determination of the eigenvalues for a sector of a particular angle; and 2) the solution of a set of simultaneous equations to determine the unknown constants appearing in the shear, moment, and deflection equations.
