AB - A finite element formulation for the analysis of deformation and stress histories in circular farm silos, during sequential loading, has been established. The silage-silo global system is considered as an axisymmetric space structure with the silage assumed as an isotropic piecewise linear viscoelastic continuum contained in an elastic cylinder. The model permits simulation of filling sequence, friction along silo-material interface, and wall deformations. The analysis is formulated in the form of a boundary value problem and approximate solutions by finite element method is achieved through variational techniques. The devised formulation was applied to predict stress histories, deformations, and resulting capacities produced during sequential loading of a 24-ft x 70-ft (7.32-m x 21.35-m) top unloading drained silo, using material constitutive functions that have been previously established through triaxial creep tests on corn silage (mc=68%).

AB - A new rational and simplified design procedure for double-tapered pitched and curved glulam beams, based on extensive theoretical and experimental analyses of this type of beam, is presented. The current design procedure is evaluated based on the results of theoretical and experimental study. Errors in the current procedure in evaluating stresses and the inapplicability of the interaction formula in the design of these beams are explained. The need for new design procedures is established in light of the shortcomings of the current design procedure. The recommended design method economizes on design time, improves the competitive position of this structural system, and insures structural integrity. Economy in use of wood which results by using the recommended procedure is illustrated in an example.

AB - Although the ultimate flexural capacity of ferrocement beams has been successfully predicted, few attempts have been made to predict deflections and crack widths under loading. Experiments were carried out to determine the load-deflection curves, crack distribution, and crack widths for ferrocement beams up to ultimate. Concurrently, an analytical model was developed to generate the nonlinear moment-curvature and load-deflection curves of ferrocement beams from the measured stress-strain curves for mortar in compression (including the descending portion) and steel meshes in tension. The model is shown to satisfactorily predict the load-deflection curves of ferrocement as well as those of reinforced concrete beams. A simple upper bound relationship is proposed to predict the average crack width in ferrocement for a given strain or stress in the extreme layer of steel mesh.

AB - In recent years tall slender buildings and slender building components have necessitated new methods of analyzing stability problems. During the past 5 yr second-order analyses or PΔ analyses have been extensively examined in the literature. This paper reviews the recent developments in this field and presents several methods in which design engineers can include PΔ moments in their analyses. The first part of the paper reviews methods currently available for carrying out second-order analyses and the second deals with the application of such analyses in the design of reinforced concrete buildings considering stability. It reviews procedures to determine when second-order analyses are required, recommends stiffness values for use in the analysis of concrete frames, and presents the steps necessary in design oriented second-order analyses.

AB - In recent years, American bridge engineers have been increasingly interested in the design and construction of the cable stayed bridge. Undoubtedly, this type of bridge will have a significant impact on future bridge construction. Recognizing the fact that many engineers are not familiar with its design and construction, a comprehensive reference list of literature and engineering data on the cable stayed bridge has been compiled. The bibliography has been classified into eight categories: (1)Development, (2)Description, (3)Theory, (4)Analysis and Design, (5)Stability, (6)Cables, (7)Construction, and (8)Miscellaneous. The engineering data illustrated schematically the bridge layouts and tower configuration of more than 60 bridges of this type throughout the world.

AB - The contributions to the P-Δ moments of such sources as semirigid connections, initial-story eccentricity, column-axial shortening, and panel zone deformation can be calculated and included in the preliminary design of multistory steel frames. For all practical purposes, the second-order effects are equal to the first-order values multiplied by an amplification factor which is a function of the story stiffness. It is shown that all these sources can significantly reduce frame stiffness to the point of causing damage to light partitions and windows.

AB - A general formulation is presented for weight optimization of indeterminate structures subject to transient dynamic loads and reliability constraints. Two distinct methods of structural analysis are examined and compared for use in the optimization algorithm: (1)Numerical integration of equations of motion and (2)shock spectra. Details of the essential computation of standard derivation of response quantities associated with each analysis technique are also examined. The formulations are illustrated by design examples of a rigid frame subjected to an acceleration impulse applied to its base.

AB - Existing methods for analysis of shear wall cores tend to involve techniques somewhat unfamiliar to designers. The frame method does not reequire the use of mathematics by the user and is applicable to a wide range of core shapes under arbitrary loading conditions. In particular torsional loading can be applied. Two elements are introduced to facilitate the use of the frame model. These are termed the solid wall element which is a bending and axial force element with rigid ends having two vertical degrees of freedom and a tracing element which is an axial force element used to preserve the cross-sectional shape of the core. The validity of the frame model is checked against three different core shapes under torsional loading.

AB - Techniques of probabilistic design theory are used to develop a method for fatigue design of structural components in ocean systems. Uncertainties that exist in material behavior, stress analysis, sea state description, as well as in the behavior of the basic theoretical model (namely the Palmgren-Miner rule) are modelled as lognormal random variables. A probability-based algorithm for fatigue design, which does not explicitly require computer analysis is presented in closed form and is, therefore, useful in preliminary design. The analysis can accommodate environments such as the Gulf of Mexico which are characterized by two different wave populations: (1)The operational sea state; and (2)storms. The model can be employed to estimate risks due to fatigue in bottom-founded ocean structures, as well as in a wide variety of other marine and terrestrial systems.
