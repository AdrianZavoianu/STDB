AB - The natural frequency and damping of several typical marine cables were measured in air and in water and are reported in this paper. The changes in natural frequency and mode shape that occur in both media as the cable sags from a taut configuration are in agreement with a recently developed linear theory. A modal crossover predicted by the theory was also observed as the cable tension was decreased. The onset of the catenary behavior has been identified and it coincides with at least an order of magnitude increase in the structural damping of the cables. The fluid dynamic contributions to the virtual mass and the damping are found to be independent of the sag in the cable and are comparable to measurements for taut cables reported in the literature.

AB - A simplified analysis of light gage steel diaphragms is described whereby a diaphragm may be reduced to a plane framework of prismatic members and analyzed using any readily available computer program for the analysis of plane frames. Suitable programs are to be found at most computer installations. The analysis is extended to include irregular diaphragms such as those containing large openings and is justified by comparison with finite element analysis. Considerationis also given to elastic-plastic analysis and comparison with selected experimental results is included.

AB - The inelastic stability of columns made of elastic-perfectly plastic-hardening materials is considered. Stable equilibrium positions are obtained for deflected columns compressed beyond the yield load. Theoretical relationships are obtained between the axial load, the lateral displacement, and the strains of idealized I columns, not sufficiently slender to buckle elastically. Buckling tests were performed on mild steel columns and the results compared to the theory. Conclusions are reached concerning the capacity of short columns to sustain loads beyond the yield load.

AB - The paper describes some problems in the history of reinforced concrete arch bridges by focusing on the three types of analyses, central to the understanding of any structural form, and consisting of the scientific to get at structural behavior, the economical to get at the construction cost, and the esthetic to get at ideas of appropriate visual form. The scientific analyses included questions of hinges, and of the participation of decks in arch bending. The economical questions centered on the extent to which designers understood construction practice; many early designers were also involved directly with construction. Finally the questions of appearance were debated frequently in terms both of cooperation with architects and of the propriety of applied decoration versus pure structural form.

AB - High-strength bolted connections in steel structures in which the bolts are loaded in tension are studied. On the basis of the theory previously developed by the writer, the influence of the different variables affecting the magnitude of the prying forces in the connection has been examined. In the investigation a large number of connections have been analyzed on computer, and as a result of this analysis a diagram for direct use in the design has been established. The application of the design diagram in the analysis of connections is illustrated in examples covering the three basic cases of the theory. A comparison between the diagram resulting from the present investigation and those obtained on the basis of the formulas given in the current (7th ed.) AISC Manual of Steel Construction is included.

AB - By the end of the century some highways in Southern Africa may be required to carry loads of over 1,000 tons. The transporters used to support these loads may have as many as 320 wheels and are therefore very long and wide. Although new bridges will have to be constructed for the heaviest loads, it is possible that many existing structures can support or be strengthened to carry loads of up to about 550 tons gross. Accurate analytical techniques are needed to assess the effects of these superloads on bridges so that every reserve of strength may be utilized. However, the multiplicity of structural configurations, construction materials, and original design specifications prevents development of simple generalized methods. Assessments, involving critical stress, may be made rapidly and precisely using a computerized influence surface technique. The Generate-Simulate-Compare (GSC) system, originally developed for abnormal load investigations, is being extended to assess the effects of future superloads on highway structures.

AB - Presently design of rectangular concrete beams under torsion is limited to underreinforced sections only. To ascertain the underreinforced character of a concrete beam it is necessary to know the balanced or maximum percentages of longitudinal and stirrup steel which can yield at failure of the beam. A semitheoretical approach based on space truss analogy has been presented to evaluate the torsional balanced percentages of reinforcements. For equal yield stresses, the balanced volume ratio between longitudinal and stirrup steel equals 1.3. Total percentage of torsional-balanced steel depends upon the concrete strength, yield stresses of reinforcements, the ratios of larger to shorter dimension of stirrups, and core area to total cross-sectional area of the beam. Beams failing under torsion can be classified according to yielding of both, either or none of the form of longitudinal and stirrup steel. Unlike flexure, a torsional-balanced failure is not accompanied by crushing of concrete.

AB - A general method for the development of valid lower bound solutions to uniformly distributed and orthotropically reinforced rectangular concrete slabs obeying normal moment criterion is described. General expressions for moment field have been obtained for nine cases of slabs having all combinations of simply supported and clamped-edge conditions. The lower bound collapse loads have been compared with the upper bound values obtained by the yield line theory. The paper also focuses attention to the need for the development of valid upper bound solutions with the satisfaction of kinematical admissibility and the flow rules associated with the normal moment criterion.

Levy-type displacement functions are used to derive stiffness matrices for full-size plate elements. Transverse loads are replaced by nodal line forces. The number of degrees-of-freedom (stiffness equations) needed for acceptable approximations is very low.

AB - The strength and drift characteristics of unbraced multistory steel frames subjected to combined loads are studied with emphasis on P-Δ effect. Seven frames having dimensions and loads typical of those found in apartment and office structures were selected. Four designs are made for each frame: three stress-controlled designs and one drift controlled design. The frames are then analyzed for their response under proportioned and nonproportioned loads. Results show that even though the strength of the structures is reduced by P-Δ effect, all stress designs can achieve a wind load factor equal to or greater than 1.40 under proportional loads, 2.06 under nonproportional loads with gravity load maintained at working value. The stress design having columns proportioned to satisfy AISC provisions does not show significant increase in strength when compared with the design neglecting instability effect. The drift designs have large wind load-carrying capacity, ranging from 1.45 to 4.0, depending on the amount of gravity load.

AB - A method of computing the collapse load of an axially loaded plate with open-section stiffeners uniformly spaced on one side is presented. The method is based on the Perry Robertson formula and provides for the loss of stiffness of the plate and for the torsional buckling of slender stiffeners. The effects of residual stresses due to welding and early loss of stiffness of wide plates are accounted for by empirically enhancing the initial plate imperfections. The design method consists of computing the minimum value for the failure loads by considering all the possible modes of collapse, i.e., plate compression failure, stiffener compression failure, and stiffener tension failure. This method, as applied to a large number of stiffened plate tests, carried out at the University of Manchester, is shown to yield satisfactory prediction of ultimate loads.

The most widely used test of these methods is the taut string for which classical solutions exist. A quick yet accurate method is needed for predicting the free vibration characteristics of relatively simple cable net systems. The method presented in this paper results in a polynomial form which eigenvalues calculated.

Experimental observations on the Harrison Street Bridge in Chicago have shown that the torque required to hold the bridge in any given position is a very good measure of the unbalance. If a bridge were in perfect balance, zero torque would be required to hold it in any given position.

AB - Simple infinite beams on an elastic foundation have presented few problems, in fact they are usually easier to solve than beams of finite length. For some time it has been possible to analyze with relative ease finite beams with arbitrary loading and foundations. The transfer matrix method is particularly useful in the static, stability, and dynamic study of beams with many changes in cross-sectional and support properties. Most available techniques encounter difficulties when applied to very long beams. It is the purpose of this paper to show how the transfer matrix method for beams of finite length can be extended to encompass beams of infinite length. With this approach it is possible to analyze, without encountering numerical instability, infinite or semi-infinite beams with any loading or arbitrary changes in properties along the beam.
