AB - A general method of computing the biaxial interaction exponent directly, for rectangular reinforced concrete columns is presented. The method takes into account all variables involved and employs the actual stress strain curve instead of the rectangular stress block. This method, which leads to the evaluation of the exponent directly, is considered simpler and more practical compared to the tedious process of obtaining the biaxial bending design constant first. The method is illustrated by three examples, the results of which are compared with those obtained from the existing aids. It was also applied to four other cross sections of columns that were tested to failure and the results of which are reported in the literature. The calculated and the test results are compared.

AB - The investigation showed that the rate of increase of slump due to the increase in the polymer/cement ratio (P/C) is less than that due to increasing the water/cement ratio (W/C). It also showed that the P/C optimum ratio within the workable range varies between 0.3 and 0.45 for any practicable W/C ratio below 0.6. It is also demonstrated that liquid polymers of the type used give better mix results when their viscosities are kept low. The polymer modified concrete in this investigation showed a tensile splitting strength increase of 255% and a compressive strength increase of 277% in the respective strengths of the control cylinders. The energy absorption characteristics of the polymer modified concrete (PMC) were almost 3½ times the control specimens making such concretes better suited to such structures as bridge decks and other dynamically loaded structures in addition to their superior serviceability performance in crack and deflection control due to their high tensile and compressive strengths as well as their higher resistance to aggressive environment.

AB - The spatial elasto-plastic behavior of steel arches is investigated in the case where they collapse due to inelastic lateral instability producing flexural-torsional deformations towards out-of-plane of the arch. A tangent stiffness matrix for large deflections of the spatial members in an elasto-plastic state is newly derived and used in the numerical calculations. Attention is paid mainly to the following parameters, i.e., slenderness ratios, residual stresses, initial lateral deflections, loading directions, and properties of the materials. Their effects on the ultimate load carrying capacity of two-hinged parabolic arches are examined and illustrated in several figures. In addition to the parametric study, a typical numerical example of the ultimate strength analysis of a central-arch-girder bridge is presented as one of applications to the actual bridge.

AB - An experimental investigation to determine the shear strength of reinforced concrete beam-column joints is presented. The test specimens consisted of six exterior beam-column subassemblages. The primary variable were the amount of transverse reinforcement in the joint, the magnitude of axial load on the column, and the severity of the load reversals applied to the beam. The experimental results indicate that the shear resisted by the concrete in the joint was considerably greater than the values suggested by current recommendations. The increase in shear strength is assumed to be influenced by the ratio of the sum of column flexural capacities to that of the beams framing into the joint. It is concluded that this ratio should be considered when designing a beam-column joint.

AB - Elastic lateral buckling moments are computed for six wide-flange beams under uniform moment for a comprehensive range of length to depth and depth to flange width ratios. Support conditions considered are fully fixed about the minor axis, hinged about the minor axis and free to warp, and hinged about the minor axis and warping suppressed. The last condition is reproduced in a prototype by welding a troughlike shape to the web and flanges in a manner that produced a warp restraining torque tube between the flanges. A numerical method is used to obtain buckling moments for the hinged-warp restrained case. The fixed-support condition is easily the superior way of suppressing buckling but that condition is often not easily producible in a practical design detail. On the other hand, the hinged-warped restrained support condition results in significant improvement in the buckling moments and has the advantage of being relatively easy to produce in a design detail.

AB - Analytical models for representing the hysteretic behavior of reinforced concrete members are reviewed. Based on results of exterior connection tests, two degrading trilinear models are suggested, one of which considers the effect of the connection. The inelastic dynamic response of a 10-story single-bay frame to earthquake excitation is evaluated using the two proposed models. For purposes of comparison, the response using a bilinear model and degrading bilinear model is also considered. Results show that inclusion of the degrading concrete stiffness and reduced connection stiffness has a significant effect on the response.

AB - Weight-optimization studies of steel frames are executed as iterative fully stressed designs of models consisting of axial force bars and quadrilateral shear panels. The bars represent the flanges and the shear panels the web of the actual structural steel member. The stiffness characteristics of the shear panels are derived from the principle of minimum complementary energy, assuming constant shearing stress in the interior and linear boundary displacements. Minimum and maximum cross-sectional properties, in addition to allowable stresses, are used as constraints. Elastic-plastic shear buckling of the web is controlled by checking against the provisions of the steel design code and overall stability by an iterative consideration of equilibrium on the deformed structure. A four-bay two-story framework with a crane rail is optimized to demonstrate the utility in a typical industrial structural design problem.
