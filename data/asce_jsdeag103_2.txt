AB - Efficient and accurate stress analysis methods are required to perform routine fracture mechanics analysis of surface and corner cracks in structures. Such analysis capabilities form the basis of fatigue life predictions for growing cracks in gas turbine engine structures. Boundary-integral equation (BIE) methods offer significant advantages to the fracture mechanics analyst in ease of use, accuracy, and modeling efficiency. Techniques for modeling three-dimensional fracture mechanics problems using the boundary-integral equation method are reviewed. Strain energy release rate modeling, together with crack opening displacement data, are found to give accurate and systematic estimates of crack front stress intensity factor distributions. Accuracy of the techniques are evaluated for well-known buried elliptical crack problems. Numerical models are extended to surface and corner cracks.

AB - The hybrid crack-containing finite element provides a powerful tool for fracture mechanics analysis of geometries too complicated to be treated by classical mehods. The basis of the hybrid method is reviewed, with emphasis upon the techniques used for crack elements. A new family of axisymmetric and plane-stress bi-material crack elements is introduced through example solutions of simple problems. Also, several example applications of analyses of real structural details with a single-material plane stress crack element are presented.

AB - The displacement-hybrid method of finite element formulation is extended to the development of a singularity super finite element which can be used to model the behavior of a sharp crack in a rectilinearly anisotropic plane. Functional representations of the displacement field surrounding a sharp crack in a rectilinearly anisotropic plane are developed from the planar form of the linear theory of anisotropic elasticity. The formulation of the displacement-hybrid singularity super element is based on a variational principle obtained from a generalization of the total potential energy. The displacement-hybrid model singularity element which results from the formulation possesses boundary and interior displacement fields which are distinctly different in nature. Certain available numerical results, which tend to confirm the validity of the formulation, are presented.

AB - A recently devloped theory for stresses around an arbitrarily loaded circular crack in an infinite body is reviewed, and examples are given illustrating its algebraic use for further analysis and numerical results it can give. It is shown how entities such as crack surface displacements and stress intensity factors are related algebraically to identifiable parts of normal and tangential loads on the crack. Since the functions underlying the theory are adaptable for computing, calculated stress patterns are given for key loads for cracks in large bodies. These cases are uniform normal load, tilted normal load, unidirectional shear, and uniform twist. While these results have their own inherent interest, they also provide good background for analyzing more complicated situations, such as in large bodies with superposed loads of differing kinds or in finite bodies where surface interactions effectively alter the crack loads in many ways.

AB - A method for computing stress intensity factors for cracks embedded in structural details is described. It consists of adding to accepted solutions for cracks in finite plates and bodies of uniform contour a geometry correction factor which accounts for the stress gradient produced by the geometric discontinuity of the detail. This correction factor is determined by integrating away the stresses normal to the line where the crack is to be inserted. The method is applied to the case of a crack emanating from a circular hole in a plate, and the results are found to be in good agreement with Bowie's numerical solution. Values of the stress intensity factor for cracks emanating from spherical weld porosities, and part-through cracks at stiffeners and cover plate ends are computed.

AB - An algorithm for choosing the least-weight statically determined configuration of a given truss under two loading conditions is presented. The procedure is based on modifying the optimal truss, under the same conditions. This latter truss is, in general, indeterminate statically and can be easily obtained, using a decomposition method briefly reviewed in the paper. At every cycle of the procedure one bar (or more) is eliminated, thus yielding an optimal truss with a lower degree of indeterminacy, until the final solution is reached. The relationship between this method and an interactive fully-stressed design procedure is examined, and an example is given. The topology of the problem is covered in an appendix. Extension to more than two loading conditions is suggested. Besides the merits of statically determinate trusses in certain structures and conditions, the least-weight truss and least-weight determinate truss provide useful bounds on the truss weight and can be used as criteria for efficient design.

AB - A method is presented for the determination of the complete load-deflection behavior of reinforced concrete two-way slabs restrained at the boundaries and subjected to uniformly distributed loading. The analysis is carried out in two stages. In the first stage the load-deflection behavior up to Johansen's load is established. In the second stage, taking into account the effect of membrane action, the load-deflection relationship is determined for loads beyond Johansen's load. The computed ultimate loads and the corresponding deflections were compared with the experimental results of 67 slabs available in the literature and a satisfactory agreement noted.

AB - Twelve square concrete slabs of 5 ft x 5 ft clear span and fully restrained at the four boundaries were tested to failure. They had a uniform average total thickness of 2 in. and measured 7 ft x 7 ft in overall dimensions. The controlling variable parameter was the variation of the grid reinforcement spacing in the two orthogonal directions, from 8 in. to 3 in., the fiberglass reinforcement area varying from 0.074 sq in./ft to 0.196 sq in./ft in each direction and a reinforcement percentage of 0.290% to 0.769%. In addition, 14 simply supported and two double-span continuous beams were also investigated. They were 5 in. wide and 12 in. deep, with a nominal effective depth of 11.25 in. and center line span of 10 ft 0 in. Analytical expressions were developed for evaluation of crack width, deflection, and limit capacity at failure.

AB - Stress resultant determination for frames composed of structural elements with relatively small length to depth ration are obtained by modified slope deflection equations; these equations incorporate shear deformation. Similar equations were presented by Goldberg in the analysis of shear wall building by means of a digital computer. However, to the writers. knowledge, the direct application of such equations tot he analysis of frames with small exist in the form of culverts, spillways openings in large dams, etc. is well known. This technical note includes the modified equations and a brief table of fixed end moments.
