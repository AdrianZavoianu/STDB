AB - Engineers in the United States are planning and designing cable-stay bridges despite the paucity of design and construction data in the American technical literature. There are no American standard codes governing the design of cable-stay bridges at this time. This report is presented as a guide to the design and construction of cable-stay bridges and as such, it is a recommended practice not a code or specification. This report has been developed in the hope that it may be useful until such time as a more complete specification may be presented to the profession by American specification and code writing bodies. The report presents information relative to loads and forces, design assumptions, analysis, deflections, cables, saddles and end fittings, corrosion protection, fabrication, erection, inspection, temperature, fatigue, and aerodynamics.

AB - This paper presents a buckling analysis of a masonry or unreinforced concrete wall that possesses no tensile strength. The wall is pinned eccentrically at both ends, and subjected to a compressive line load at the top and the weight as distributed along the height. The governing differential equation is nonlinear and includes terms called spatial delays which require the prediction of the displacement at points different from the point at which the solution is currently sought. The method of solution is finite difference with a polynomial prediction for the delay terms. Interaction curves are presented which illustrate the critical buckling load as a function of the weight. Previously obtained results are presented for comparison wherever appropriate.

AB - Picture-frame shear tests of the in-plane shear stiffness of discretely attached corrugated plates with trapezoidal corrugations were conducted. The test specimens were commercially available corrugated panels 23-⅝-in. (600 mm) (six corrugations) wide, with lengths ranging from a maximum of 90 in. (2,290 mm) to a minimum of 18 in. (460 mm). Two kinds of discrete attachments were employed at the ends of the corrugations, i.e., wide attachments and small attachments. The wide attachments consisted of a bolt and a wide washer in each corrugation end, which effectively clamped the entire width of each trough to the edge member. The small attachments were obtained by removing the washers. The sides of the panel were attached to their edge members by bolts at 6-in. (150-mm) spacing. The experiments agreed with theory, despite the fact that the latter are based on a panel that is infinitely many corrugations wide. For best accuracy of shear stiffness prediction by tests it may be necessary to take the axial deformations of the edge members into account in the case of the longer panels.

AB - The paper attempts to review the total available knowledge of significance in the structural analysis of reinforced concrete tanks. The tanks considered are of monolithic construction and are cylindrical or composed of inter-connected plates. In the case of the latter, elastic theories are reviewed in the categories of analytical, analogy and numerical methods. Then plastic theories are considered in the categories of methods based on firstly Johansen's yield-line theory and secondly Hillerborg's strip method. In the case of cylindrical tanks elastic and then plastic theories are reviewed. A bibliography is presented in chronological order so that the historical development can be visually appreciated. It attempts to list all papers giving knowledge of some significance in this field for the use of practical designers or researchers.

AB - The feasibility of end-joining wooden beams with thin steel plates was investigated. The data on the elastic and mechanical properties of joined beams in bending are used to examine the failure mechanisms, i.e., wood-failure, steel-failure, and glue-failure of the steel reinforced end-joints. The assumptions made of the stress distributions in each of these cases leads to theoretical results which closely predict the experimental results. A convenient design procedure is suggested.

AB - An energy balance criterion, based on fracture mechanics concepts, is proposed for predicting the loads at which concrete members develop rapidly propagating cracks. After an initial period during which microcracks increase slowly in length and extent over a critical region of the member, an unstable running crack develops when the rate of energy released by continuing microcrack growth exceeds the energy inputed to the system. The shape of the growing microcrack zone is determined by the stress intensity factors for the extremities of the principal axes of that zone. A critical strain energy release rate, Gc, is determined from direct tensile data and its appropriateness verified by showing that strength and size effects are correctly predicted for modulus of rupture specimens. Diagonal tension cracking load expressions for reinforced concrete beams are developed using that Gc value and energy criterion. Those expressions correctly predict the effects established from tests of the moment of shear ratio, reinforcement ratio, type of loading, and size of member.

AB - The optimal configuration and discrete member sizes are automatically determined to minimize the cost of three-dimensional indeterminate truss structures under multiple loading conditions. Member areas and joint coordinates are used as design variables. Design constraints include Euler buckling and specified limits on member stresses, member sizes, and joint displacements. Design variables may be linked and members can be deleted. The design process is separated into geometry modifications using the complex method and suboptimization using the stress ratio method and an analogous scaling procedure for displacement constraints. For each geometry change, discrete member sizes are selected from a table of allowable values. The method is applied to the cost minimization of a 25-member space truss using discrete steel angle sections that are chosen from a table satisfying AISC code requirements, and comparisons are made with minimum weight designs and with continuous variable methods.

AB - Methods for analytically predicting the behavior of reinforced concrete beams subjected to fire are presented. These incorporate the temperature-dependent strength degradation in the steel as well as thermal and creep strains. The parameters that are important for predicting beam behavior are identified through a sensitivity study. The application of reliability analysis techniques in developing fire-resistant design procedure is also examined. Using probabilistic methods, safety factors for design can be developed which are commensurate with the required reliability and levels of uncertainty arising from basic randomness and modeling error.

AB - The findings of an earlier paper are extended to include the behavior of cables with support points at different levels. It is shown that generalized expressions can be used for the direct design of such inclined cables under uniform loading where stress or slope limitations are specified. The inclined cable expressions may, alternatively, be used as a means of analyzing cables for relatively simple load cases. The cable is considered as a number of inclined segments that join the loading points. The method is demonstrated by three examples. The results from the examples are compared with other solutions for the same problems. All of the expressions derived in the paper are based on the parabolic approximation to the true elastic catenary shape which the cable adopts. It is shown that the accuracy which can be achieved lies well within the normal bounds of engineering accuracy.

AB - As most loads on buildings and structures are stochastic in nature, an analytical method for studying load combination is presented in which the loads are treated as random processes. Factors considered include load occurrence rate, intensity variation, duration of each occurrence, and simultaneous occurrence of different loads. The probability distribution of the maximum combined load effect over a given time interval is derived and the distribution parameters as functions of the first two moments and the occurrence rate of individual loads are also obtained in close form. Numerical examples are given and the results are compared satisfactorily with Monte-Carlo simulation. The reduction factors for load combination as given in current building codes are examined and their inadequacy pointed out.

A total of seven charts are prepared to design the retaining wall stem, footing length, heel and toe thickness, and to find the toe soil bearing pressure. A summary of equations used to develop the charts is included. The charts are drawn using the Strength Design Design Method of Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete (ACI 318-71). Rankine earth pressure theory is used for a horizontal backfill, and the concrete ultimate strength is 3,000 psi with the steel yield strength of 60,000 psi. An example is included which shows the procedure of using the charts. These charts simplify the problem of designing a cantilever retaining wall by hand, and the charts are both accurate and efficient.

AB - The results of an extensive analysis of the three-dimensional free vibration of a single span cable, using nonlinear finite elements, is presented. The method provides excellent results throughout the spectrum of end conditions and geometric nonlinearity. For a homogeneous cable of constant cross section, the nonlinear equilibrium position and the natural frequencies were shown to depend only on the end conditions and the stiffness-to-weight ratio. It has been demonstrated that results of engineering usefulness can be obtained from plots made for a typical value of the stiffness-to-weight ratio since realistic deviations from this value result in only minor changes in the frequencies. An empirical formula based on static calculations, which gives a good approximation to the lowest natural frequency, has been presented.

AB - This note is concerned with the flexural buckling of a prismatic column having a single brace not parallel to either of the principal axes of the column cross section. One way is which the condition could arise would be if a single angle compression member were braced in the direction of one of its legs. The principles governing variations of this problem are developed by considering the case represented by Fig. 1. The length of the column is l, the principle axes are x-x and y-y. The column is fixed at A and Free at B except for the brace BC which is in the x-y plane. It will be assumed that Ix, the moment of inertia about the x-x axis, is smaller then Iy, the moment of inertia about the y-y axis. The smallest value of the buckling load, P, is desired.
