AB - Vertical and torsional motions of a suspension bridge due to wind loading are studied. Both, self-excited, due to bridge motion, and buffeting, independent of bridge motion, wind loads are included. The self-excited aerodynamic forces are modeled using aerodynamic coefficient or Duhamel integral formulations. For this purpose, experimental information on section models from wind tunnel testing is utilized. The buffeting random loads are determined from specified spectral densities or horizontal and vertical turbulent wind velocity fluctuations. Numerical results are obtained using frequency and time domain formulations. Dynamic bridge stability is also investigated.

AB - The main objective of the elastic rests was to determine the amount of shearing force carried by the tee sections above the opening, VT, and below the opening, VB. This shearing force distribution is required to apply the approximate Vierendeel method for determining the elastic stresses. In the experimental investigation, linear strain gages were used to obtain strain distributions. These curves were numerically integrated to determine the moments at sections a specific distance apart and the shearing forces were then found from equilibrium requirements. In the finite element study both normal stresses and shearing stresses were used to find the shearing forces. These results are compared to those obtained from five theoretical formulas for VT/VB. Curves comparing the normal stresses found by the different methods and curves showing the effect of the addition of reinforcing bars are presented.

AB - The stability of tall, rigidly-jointed, unbraced, steel frames under pure gravity loads is ensured when proportioned by the current allowable-stress concept provided they meet certain specified constraints. These requirements, in fact, govern the individual story stiffnesses and the maximum axial stresses in the columns. A study on seven building frames confirms that for a class of inherently stiff frames, all instability effects may be ignored in design without affecting structural safety under gravity loads.

AB - The testing sequence and observed behavior of a one-third scale model prestressed concrete flat plate with unbonded tendons is reported. The nine-panel model was 2.9-in. thick with 8-in. x 8-in. columns spaced 10 ft on center both directions. Draped ¼-in. diam seven-wire strands provided the prestress force with their distribution 70% in the column strip and 30% in the middle strip each direction. Bonded reinforcement was provided only in the immediate column regions where the ACI-ASCE Committee No.423 minimum, 0.15% of the column strip area, was supplied as top bars. Flexural strength and behavior was excellent and yield line analysis showed very good agreement with measured strength. Failure in shear occurred following flexural yield line development at load level above the ACI code factored load. Shear strength analysis showed the ACI-ASCE Committee equation to be safe for design of prestressed flat plates. Cracking was well controlled by the minimum bonded reinforcement. Use of the equivalent frame of ACI Code was supported for design.

AB - Structural floor load data from five major live-load surveys are analyzed probabilistically in order to determine the accuracy of fitted normal, lognormal, and gamma distributions. Histograms and scaled cumulative graphs are made for every use type from each survey and statistical goodness-of-fit tests made on the assumed distributions. Data from the surveys are combined by occupancy type to compute load levels with high probabilities of nonexceedance, and comparisons are made among conservative levels of observed loads, present design values, and the computed loads. Results indicate that the gamma distribution provides a realistic approximation to the observed data, and in particular yields excellent prediction of observed office load data up to the 99.9% cumulative level. Present design loads for offices, domestic dwellings, and mercantile occupancies appear to approximate the 99.99% cumulative level.

AB - To ensure the safety of nuclear power plants in the event of a tornado strike it is required that, in addition to the direct action of the wind and of the moving pressure field, the designer consider the impact of tornado-borne missiles, i.e., of objects moving under the action of aerodynamic forces induced by the tornado wind. It is, therefore, necessary that estimates be made of the speeds attained by potential missiles under such tornado wind conditions as are specified for the design of nuclear power plants. To calculate such speeds a rational model for the tornado-borne missile was proposed, based on the assumption that the missile tumbles during its flight, and a computer program was developed, based on this model. Missile trajectories and speeds were calculated corresponding to various assumptions regarding the initial conditions and the tornado wind field. The sensitivity of the results to changes in these assumptions was examined.

AB - This paper proposes an equation solving adjunct for improving the optimality of computer solution of many (thousands of) sparsely-populated linear equations. The paper provides a formal and computer implementation description of the algorithm, illustrating solution steps, and comparing equation solving by the process with modified Gauss decomposition. While the process increases calculations over Gauss decomposition, it is expected to reduce computer costs by factors up to seven because of its superior data handling potential. It permits imposing linear constraints and making equilibrium checks to be an integral part of the equation solving process. In the finite element analysis, assembly of the system stiffness and evaluation of element generalized forces can also be integrated with the equation solution. When an N-step iterative method is used for solving the transformed equations, it forms with the adjunct a hybrid iterative method which requires about the same number of calculations as Gauss decomposition.
