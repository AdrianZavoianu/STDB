AB - The differences between the values calculated for the dynamic alongwind response, the gust response factors, and the total alongwind response obtained using various current procedures may in certain cases be of the order of 100%. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the causes of such differences. A comparison is made between alongwind deflections of typical buildings selected as case studies, calculated by both new and traditional procedures, some of which are described in various building codes. The reasons for the differences between the respective results are pointed out. The procedures were evaluated on the basis of a recently developed method which utilizes a logarithmic variation of wind speed with height above ground and a height-dependent expression for the spectrum of the longitudinal wind speed fluctuations. The method also allows for realistic cross-correlation between pressures on the windward and leeward building faces.

AB - A main girder of the Lafayette Street Bridge over the Mississippi River in St. Paul was discovered to be cracked on May 7, 1975. A detailed examination of the fracture is given in this paper. Fractographic examinations and analyses of crack growth showed that fatigue crack growth and brittle fracture both contributed to the members' failure. Fatigue cracks were found to originate at large lack of fusion areas in the lateral bracing gusset to transverse stiffener weld. After the crack had nearly penetrated the web thickness, it precipitated a brittle fracture. Subsequent intervals of fatigue crack growth and fracture were also observed. Recommendations are also provided on ways to retrofit the bridge details to prevent reoccurrence at other comparable details. In addition, a suggested detail configuration for this type of connection is recommended for future use.

AB - The 3rd edition of the Structural Stability Research Council Guide to Stability Design Criteria for Metal Structures (formerly the Column Research Council Guide to Design Criteria for Metal Compression Members) is reviewed. The effective length and equivalent slenderness ratio concepts are defined and differentiated. Multiple column strength curves, made available in the 3rd edition, together with an accurate determination of effective length, are shown to provide a means of reducing the uncertainties in column strength calculations. Procedures for determining modified effective lengths in the inelastic range are developed through simplified frame examples that include: (1)Columns connected to restraining members; (2)columns that support adjacent members; and (3)columns in building frames. Limitations in the use of the effective length concept are delineated.

AB - Analysis of uncertainties plays a central role in all reliability-based design procedures. Herein, the uncertainty in the resistance of reinforced concrete members subjected to combined bending and thrust is studied using Monte-Carlo techniques. The effects of load eccentricity, reinforcement ratio, and the contributions of individual uncertainties in the design parameters are examined. The results should aid in determining resistance factors for reinforced concrete design which are commensurate with the level of uncertainty using reliability-based concepts.

AB - A finite element formulation, based on the displacement method, for the analyses of stability and geometric nonlinear large deflections of wood transmission structures is presented. The formulation admits both prismatic and nonprismatic elements and handles the special joints associated with wood connections. The nonlinear solution is performed in load increments with iterations at each step. Only the elastic stiffness matrix of large displacements is employed in the solution. A technique is proposed by which the incremental load vector is modified at initial and intermediate increments of loads in a way which ensures the absence of axial forces in the supporting columns of the structure and thus guarantees a correct solution. The overall buckling loads are efficiently predicted utilizing the Southwell plot method. Comparison of theoretical results with full-scale test results of actual structures validate the method.

AB - Recently, the concept of autostresses was developed for unifying the elastic and plastic design of steel structures, autostresses being the residual stresses that occur during the initial application of load as a result of localized yielding. The present design methods of steel beams with web openings were re-examined using autostress principles. This showed that the present plastic-design equations for beams with web openings permit live load only when the opening is in a region of pure bending. When the opening is in a shear span, the factored shear force and factored beinding moment at the opening must be reduced to conservative (and probably uneconomical) values before live loads can be permitted, according to autostress principles. Therefore, new plastic-design equations were derived which lead to admissible autostresses and permissible live loads at all moment-shear ratios.

AB - An interaction equation, with values of bending moment and torsion at full plasticity of the section, based on results in the literature, is used in the analysis. The effect of shear force is neglected and it is assumed that the cross-sectional properties of the beam do not vary along its length. The possible modes of failure for beams with one and two concentrated loads are reviewed in detail; it is shown that certain transition modes, not previously described in the literature, are essential for a complete solution. In addition, modes of failure for beams without bending or torsional restraint at the supports are given for the case of a single point load. Methods of solution described are based on a lower bound approach and where the application of the yield criterion at the plastic hinges does not give sufficient equations, the solution is obtained by means of optimization procedure. Complete results plotted in nondimensional form are given for typical beams.

AB - The object of the work reported in this paper is to obtain a measure and an understanding of the damping in high-strength friction-grip bolted joints. Static tests to determine the coefficient of friction and cyclic tests to determine the amount of damping in symmetrical double-coverplated butt joints are described. Four plate surfaces were examined, i.e., galvanized, inorganic zinc silicate, urethane chromate primer, and mill scale. An energy loss relationship was found for each surface type. At the working load levels, the damping factors ranged from 5% to 12%, and the energy losses, after early variations, tended to stable values with increasing numbers of cycles. Suggestions on improvements to increase joint damping are given.

AB - Considerable experimental research on the influence of shear on the performance of flexural hinges under reversed loadings has been reported in the literature. Using existing data, a means of making comparisons between test results is devised and design requirements for shear in members under reversed loading are suggested. Results of 65 tests from six investigations are compared on the basis of modified work index, a measure of the hysteresis exhibited by the test specimens under load reversals. Factors that significantly influenced the work index were level of axial force, shear span to depth ratio, and maximum applied shear stress. Design recommendations for maximum shear stress and minimum transverse reinforcement are developed for satisfactory performance of hinging regions.
