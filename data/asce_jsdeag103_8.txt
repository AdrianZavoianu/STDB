AB - Results obtained in a study of a large-scale curved two-span four-cell reinforced concrete box-girder bridge model are presented. The model, which was a 1:2.82 scale replica of a prototype, had overall dimensions of 72 ft (21 m) long by 12 ft (3.7 m) wide. The radius of curvature was 100 ft (30.5 m). Experimental and theoretical results are given for reactions, deflections, and moments due to working stress point loads applied before and after overload stress levels in the bridge. Comparisons are made with the results previously obtained for a similar straight box-girder bridge. Conclusions are presented on the adequacy of the theory in predicting the bridge response.

AB - Results obtained in a study of a large-scale curved two-span four-cell reinforced concrete box girder bridge model are presented. The model, which was a 1:2.82 scale replica of a prototype, had overall plan dimensions of 72 ft (21 m) long by 12 ft (3.7 m) wide. The radius of curvature was 100 ft (30.5 m). This represents the sharpest curvature normally used for bridges in the California highway system. Experimental and theoretical results are considered for reactions, steel and concrete strains, deflections, and moments due to conditioning overloads producing stress values as high as 2.5 times the nominal design stress. The loading to failure and the ultimate strength behavior is examined. The excellent live-load overload capacity of the bridge is evaluated and comparisons are made with the similar behavior of an earlier tested straight bridge model. Conclusions appropriate for the design of this type of bridge are given.

In this analysis the governing partial differential equations are replaced by a system of first-order differential equations and then solved by the multisegment numerical integration method. Results obtained from this analysis compare very well with those obtained by the energy and Fourier series methods.

AB - An analysis of live loads in offices is presented which applies probabilistic live load models to the results of a recent survey of office buildings in the United States conducted by the National Bureau of Standards. The results are compared to a study of live loads in offices in the United Kingdom and the design loads currently specified by ANSI A58.1-1972. On the basis of this study, a new expression for computing allowable reductions in live loads is proposed.

AB - A review of field measurements on bridges under traffic showed that a family of Rayleigh probability-density curves can represent the frequency of occurrence of stress ranges of different magnitudes in actual bridges. A particular histogram for a bridge can be approximated by a particular curve from the family. Each curve is defined by: (1)The modal stress range, Srm; and (2)a parameter Srd, which is a measure of the width of the probability-density curve. Different combinations of Srm and Srd were included. The variable-amplitude data can be related to the constant-amplitude data by using an effective stress range to represent the variable-amplitude spectrum. The effective stress range is the constant-amplitude stress range that would result in the same fatigue life as the variable-amplitude spectrum, and may be taken as the root-mean-square stress range of the spectrum or calculated from Miner's law.

AB - A method of forming latex-modified fiberglass-reinforced concrete shell roof structures with pneumatically supported foamed plastic forms is presented. Observations of the shell model during the application of the mortar indicated that on the prototype shell concrete application will have to proceed in layers and in a planned pattern of progress over the surface of the shell. The experimental and numerical elastic responses corroborated one another. In addition, the failure crack pattern reflects positions of maximum tensile strain which are presented. The ultimate load carrying capacity of the shell provides a factor of safety of about 2.5 over a design loading of 30 psf (1,440 N/mÂ²). The shell structure could be realized either as a concrete shell or as a plastic sandwich shell as witnessed by the plastic foam form.

AB - The finite element displacement method is used with annular plate, thin-walled curved beam, straight prismatic beam, and frame-type diaphragm elements for the dynamic analysis of horizontally curved I-girder highway bridges. The stiffness and inertia properties of the finite elements are obtained within the bounds of linear elasticity and small displacement theories. Warping of the girder cross section due to torsion is included in the analysis. The moving vehicle on the bridge is idealized as a sprung mass supported on two unsprung masses. The centrifugal forces arising due to the motion of the vehicle in a circular path are included in the analysis. The inclusion of the vehicle inertia in the bridge-vehicle interaction results in a set of differential equations, the coefficients of which depend on the speed of the vehicle and thus are not constant. These equations of motion are solved by the linear-acceleration method of numerical integration.

AB - A method is proposed for the determination of the optimum depth and area of flexural reinforcement for reinforced concrete T-beam sections. To evaluate an objective function, a ratio of steel to concrete costs is necessary. The problem is solved using the Lagrange multipliers method. Three examples are presented to illustrate calculation procedures, and some characteristics of the optimum solutions are considered. The method can serve as the basis for developing general rules for selecting effective depths and reinforcement ratios for T-beams including rectangular sections.

AB - Welded, tubular box trusses of aluminum alloy 6061-T6 were subjected to static and fatigue tests in bending. Experimental determinations were made of residual welding and bolting stresses as well as stresses resulting from the applied loading. Primary and secondary stresses in the members and local stresses at the joints due to the applied loads were calculated by the finite element method. The fatigue strength of the trusses was compared to that of small double strap fillet welded specimens. The fatigue strength of the tubular trusses was in reasonable agreement with the strength of the small joints when secondary bending stresses plus stresses due to local bending of the tube walls were considered in the analysis. Residual stresses due to welding and bolting did not appear to have much effect on fatigue life.

AB - Beam-column finite elements in conjunction with transfer matrices and an incremental loading procedure are used to directly generate the total moments, and axial and transverse displacements of a stack or tower structure having a stepped or tapered cross section. The structure may be subjected to any number of concentrated shears, axial forces, and moments, as well as any number of piece-wise constant distributed transverse and longitudinal forces. By additional use of a standard Southwell plot, the transverse deflections generated by compressive axial loads may be plotted to yield the critical buckling load. Solution of the internal forces and deflections proceeds serially from the free end of the stack or tower structure, without the necessity of computing global elastic and geometric stiffness matrices. Computer storage therefore varies linearly rather than to the square of the number of finite elements used to model the stack or tower configuration.

AB - The behavior of reinforced concrete beams in the range of behavior in which moment is decreasing while deformation continues to increase, the post-crushing range, was studied. Tests on six beams with transverse steel alone and with both compressive and transverse steel are reported. A theoretical model of the failure mechanism in the crushing zone is presented and theoretical rotations and deflections are computer based on that model. Theoretical values are compared with experimental results. Good correlation is obtained for curvatures up to six times those corresponding to the maximum moment.

AB - The George Washington Bridge raised two fundamental problems in the history and esthetics of bridge design: (1)The relationship between esthetic preference and structural performance; and (2)the relationship between the architecture of bridges and their engineering. The first relationship was put in terms of the flexible deck: the George Washington Bridge, as originally completed in 1931, had almost no vertical stiffness. The second relationship arose in the design of the towers, for which architectural plans envisioned masonry forms while engineering requirements dictated a steel structure. Thus, that design followed from two questionable assumptions: (1)The deck could be without vertical stiffness; and (2)the steel towers should be covered with a masonry facade. The first led directly to the failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940, and the second carried forward the idea that in large-scale structures, the engineering form needed an architectural facade to be elegant.

AB - The results of a program of racking tests of wall panels can be incorporated into the analysis of high-rise structures influenced by nonstructural partitions. Stiffness and energy-absorbing characteristics were obtained from racking tests of wall panels simulating lateral interstory displacements in high-rise buildings. These characteristics were combined with structural frame periods and damping to estimate overall building periods and damping. Illustrative examples are presented. The research program was part of the structural response research program being conducted for the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration, Nevada Operations Office by URS/John A. Blume &amp; Associates, Engineers.
