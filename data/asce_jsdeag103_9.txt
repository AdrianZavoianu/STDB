AB - An analysis for the large deflection behavior of simply supported initially flat rectangular plates subjected to uniform edge compression having a slight eccentricity with respect to the middle surface of the plate is presented based on the solution of the von Karman large deflection equations of the plate. All the boundary conditions including those involving the normal bending moment at the loaded edges are exactly satisfied. The governing equations are reduced to a system of coupled nonlinear algebraic equations in terms of Fourier Coefficients which is solved by the Newton-Raphson Method. Numerical results for square plates are graphically presented to illustrate the effect of the load eccentricity on the bending of the plate.

AB - The flanges of six W14x320 sections with milled ends were joined together at midheight with different size partial penetration groove welds to form short columns; one additional specimen had complete penetration groove welds through both flanges. Four of the specimens were failed directly in tension; three were subjected to a few compression-tension cycles until failure. The experiments were designed to simulate conditions which can develop in some columns of steel frames during severe earthquakes. The spliced joints developed their specified strengths with the smallest weld attaining highest stress. Failure for all specimens with partial penetration groove welds occurred through the splice exhibiting very limited ductility. The data generated by these experiments should be useful for earthquake design as well as provide basic information on the behavior of partial penetration groove welds of unprecedented size.

AB - Laboratory tests on two W16x45 A36 steel beams and three W16x40 A36 steel beams with reinforced eccentric web openings are described and summarized. The principal test parameters were the opening size and the amount of opening reinforcement. Tests were carried to failure and the deflections, modes of failure, and ultimate loads recorded. The results of inelastic finite element analyses of the test beams are also summarized. It is concluded that both the experimental and finite element results are reasonably consistent with the four hinge failure mechanism assumed in a previously developed ultimate strength analysis, and that this ultimate strength analysis provides an adequate prediction of the strength of beams with reinforced eccentric web openings.

AB - A systematic methodology has been developed to determine risk to structures from four hazards: fire, flood, earthquake, and wind. This methodology combines seven major elements: the hazard model to provide a probabilistic description of each hazard, the exposure model to describe the assets exposed, the vulnerability model to describe the condition and strength of each structure, the damage algorithm to provide a relationship between hazard intensity and degree of damage expected, a set of alternative mitigations, cost data for the mitigations, and a risk equation. The risk equation produces an estimate of the average annual loss or the risk of mission loss. A number of possible mitigations are considered for each structure and each hazard. The average annual loss (i.e., risk) is computed for each hazard for the structure as is, and with each mitigation applied separately. This information is used to select an optimum investment program that minimizes the risk from the hazards. The hazard models and damage algorithms are based on information available in technical literature. The exposure and vulnerability data are project dependent.

AB - The beam method and conventional ultimate flexural theory for prestressed concrete beams are used to predict the ultimate load of prestressed concrete cylindrical shell roofs of long and intermediate length. Tests on model shells, constructed of precast elements prestressed together longitudinally with draped and straight cables within the curved surface, show that the beam method gives an accurate or conservative prediction, provided the failure is in longitudinal flexure. The method assumes that the shell spans as a simply supported beam between cable ends, and it is essentially a linear elastic method. After cracking, even though the shell cross section tends to change shape, prediction of ultimate load based on the original shape will only be unconservative for long narrow shells of small structural depth which are likely to be unsatisfactory even in the uncracked range. The geometry of the five models varied between length/radius of two to three and a half included angle of 30? to 43—.

AB - The paper describes the repair of the Strijdom Square Memorial Monument in Pretoria. The monument is a concrete domed structure. The dome consists of reinforced concrete arches supported at three points. These arches are connected by means of a thin concrete slab. At the time of the removal of the shuttering the supports rotated and the whole dome deflected causing cracks to appear throughout the structure. The repair was effected by externally placed cables, the force and position of which were established by computer analysis of the structure. Making use of different combinations of prestressing forces and movement of the legs of the structure a method was found whereby the stresses in the overstressed areas of the dome could be reduced. The post-tensioning cables were used to cause external loads on the structure and also fixed-end moments to the supports. These cables were used in different combinations and layouts on the surface of the dome.

AB - This study is concerned with the overload behavior of composite steel-concrete highway girder bridges. The post-elastic behavior is investigated, and the effect of some design parameters on bridge response is studied. This paper describes a nonlinear finite element analysis procedure permitting the determination of the state of stress and deformation under given levels of overload. The nonlinear behavior of the structure due to the various sources of nonlinearity: crack propagation, concrete yielding and crushing, and yielding of the reinforcing steel and girder steel is reproduced through the use of appropriate constitutive laws. A shear retention factor is introduced to account for aggregate interlock and dowel action. An analysis of the effects of discretization and of some material properties on bridge response in the post-cracking range is included, and numerical examples are presented to confirm the validity of the developed numerical solution procedure.

AB - A finite element model is presented for the lateral buckling analysis of beams and frames having a plane of symmetry in the midsurface of the web. In-plane and out-of-plane behaviors are assumed to be uncoupled. Lower order displacement assumptions are used for the geometric stiffness matrices than for the conventional stiffness matrices. Specific applications of the two-dimensional model are demonstrated for the analysis of structures having I-section members. The proposed model for such members accounts for the interaction between the local and the overall buckling phenomena. The web is allowed to distort. Realistic representation of I-section structures with tapered members, deep sections, complex joints, web stiffeners, and various elastic restraints can be made. Effects of stress concentrations at the joints and under the loads are considered. Three numerical examples: (1)A beam with a stiffener; (2)a gable frame; and (3)a deep highway bridge girder, are presented to illustrate the applicability of the model.

Two effective width equations for the post-buckling behavior have been compared with test results indicating good correlation. Two procedures for calculating the flexural buckling strength of columns including the effects of local buckling, based on tangent modulus and Column Research Council Methods, are presented. The column curves obtained using these two methods indicate good correlation with the results of tests on cold-formed steel columns.

AB - The principal structural actions in beams curved in plan are bending, torsion, and shear. Available methods of plastic analysis are based on the simplifying assumption that the effect of shear on the yield criterion is negligible. Clearly this is not a reasonable assumption in the case of reinforced concrete beams, and to account for the effect of shear, two three-dimensional bending-torsion-shear surfaces are proposed. The analysis of curved beams using the interaction surfaces is then described and the effect of shear on the modes of failure and the ultimate loads is demonstrated. As expected, the effect is significant and new modes of failure are found. Implications of the theory in the design of reinforced concrete beams are briefly described.

AB - The buffeting response of suspended-span bridges can be calculated if certain wind-tunnel section model data, plus wind spectral information, are provided. The needed wind tunnel data are the self-excited aerodynamic (flutter) coefficients. The meteorological data required are vertical and horizontal gust spectra of the natural wind at the bridge site. The natural mechanical modes of vibration in bending (vertical and lateral) and torsion are assumed known, and the response of each of these with postulated negligible aerodynamic coupling between modes, is calculated. Some examples are then given of the calculated vertical and torsional buffeting responses of a flexible long-span bridge (Golden Gate type) and a stiff, medium-span type (Sitka Harbor). The wind velocity range covered is 60 mph to 90 mph (27 m/s to 40 m/s).
