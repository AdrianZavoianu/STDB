AB - Tensile tests were performed on 335 full-size glued-laminated members made up wholely of grade L3 Douglas-fir and larch laminations. The variable studies were: thickness of laminations, number of laminations, and width of laminations. The modulus of elasticity, specific gravity, and knot sizes and locations were determined for all laminations. Eleven parameters based on the aforementioned data were related to tensile strength by multiple linear regression analysis. The most closely related parameters were: modulus of elasticity, lamination thickness, and lamination width. The knot parameter K/b (from USDA Bulletin 1069) was found to be ineffective as a predictor of strength. Tensile strength was generally related to the projected area of the largest knot or knots, nor the proportion of their width to lamination width. Number of laminations between the limits of 2 and 7 did not have significant influence on tensile strength.

AB - Some helpful hints and comments, which are based on 10 yr of experience with both users and finite element programs, are included along with two examples that illustrate some problems in modeling and that underline the user's responsibility for proper use of a program and adequate modeling. Many articles and books have dealt with the finite element theory or computational algorithms. For example, during the five-yr period between Oct. 1971 - Jan. 1977 over 40 papers relating to finite element analysis have appeared in the ASCE Journal of the Structural Division. Only a few papers or articles have dealt with the practical aspects of discretization and modeling, or the practical use of finite element programs for structural analysis. This paper contains guidelines relating to application of the finite element method.

AB - The pitfalls underlying the use of the effective column length concept in frame design are illustrated. It is shown that such a concept can be unsatisfactory for both braced and unbraced fromes whether they are loaded predominantly by gravity loads or by combined gravity and lateral loads. The basis for the development of a rational design method based upon the story stiffness concept is then presented. This design procedure can eliminate the use of the K-factor, if all secondary effects are included in the calculation of the real forces acting on the members. In the light of the unconservative nature of present design specifications, some fundamental formulation is proposed for their possible modifications. In particular, it is recommended that calculation of story stiffness be a clearly stated requirement in design codes.

Using as the forcing function the actual recorded wind pressures neasured by transducers installed about the throat of the Martin's Creek tower, the tower's dynamic response is determined and compared to its quasistatic response.

AB - A theoretical analysis and experimental tests were conducted on commercially available plastic pipe (PVC and ABS) filled with a concrete core. The theoretical analysis implied an interaction between the concrete core and plastic pipe and a corresponding increase in strength of the concrete core. Under a column loading, the structural behavior of the plastic pipe was similar to the behavior of spiral reinforcement. The plastic pipe increased the strength of the concrete core approximately 3.2 times the pipe burst pressure. Slenderness ratio effects reduced the column capacity once they reached a value of 20. Test results show that concrete filled plastic pipe columns show considerable promise for structural applications.

AB - Variations in temperature within a typical interior deck-stringer section of a composite-girder highway bridge are investigated for mid-Missouri weather exposures. The exposures correspond to ambient air temperature extremes and were selected from National Weather Service data for the period 1946 through 1965. Equations to simulate these weather extremes and a finite element analysis are used to calculate bridge temperatures as a function of time. The results show that the temperature at the top of a bridge deck may be as high as 150°F (66°C) for a midsummer day and as low as -10°F (-23°C) for a cold winter day. The temperature differential between the top and the bottom of the deck for a hot day was 39°F (22°C) and for a cold day was 31°F (17°C). The maximum deck temperature occurred at 2:00 p.m. for the hot day and at 1:00 p.m. for the cold day. The minimum deck temperature occurred at 4:00 a.m. for both the hot and the cold day.

AB - In absence of reliable analytical procedures, the adequacy of structural resistance can be judged from proof-loading experiments. Neither a unified method nor a clear rationale exists now for the design of such experiments. Reliability approaches have been only partially successful, due to their oversimplification of the test, especially with regard to the information that is obtained from proof reading, which is reduced simply to failure or survival. Classical models of this type are reformulated and extended to include multivariate resistance and the possible presence of gross errors. More realistic models are also proposed, that utilize indirect information on ultimate resistance (e.g., loss of serviceability, cracking, softening). Gross errors and indirect information are of critical importance in determining the intensity of proof loading.

AB - Modal analysis with inelastic response spectra is often used to design multistory frames subjected to earthquake motions. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, three different frames were designed using smooth inelastic spectra derived according to the Newmark-Hall rules for ductility factors of two and four. These frames were analyzed with an inelastic dynamic analysis program for three different artificial motions generated to match the design spectra. It was found that this design procedure fails to reflect variation of yielding patterns or local concentration of inelastic action. Curvature ductility factors at several locations exceed significantly the design ductility level. Axial forces in exterior columns produced by inelastic response can be larger than what inelastic spectra modal analysis predicts, leading to reduced plastic moment capacities and increased ductility demands. It appears that spectral modification factors could be used for local ductility control.

AB - New design formulas are derived for the large-deflection strength of square steel panels subjected to simultaneous lateral pressure and inplane thrust. Using a rigid-plastic planar-segment idealization the influence on strength of inplane edge conditions that are: (1)Fully restrained; (2)free to pull in but constrained to be straight; and (3)completely unrestrained; all three conditions with and without flexural clamping, is examined. It is shown that strength under both types of loading at high deformations is largely dependent on inplane conditions for which asymptotic strengths are given. By relating the lateral deflection parameter of the planar-segment idealization to the edge-slope as well as the central deflection of actual panels, predicted strengths bound published test data.

Comparisons of calculated depths of penetration into uniform or layered earth with test results are excellent. The residual velocity of the projectile after penetration of the overburden material is used to determine the penetration into concrete structures. The comparisons between test results and predicted values are excellent.

AB - The minimum weight design of constant height unstiffened plate girders has been formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem using the American Institute of Steel Construction specification. The girders are assumed to be symmetrical and fully restrained against lateral buckling. A two-stage minimization procedure is then employed to obtain minimum weight solutions. The results of the study are in the form of simple design curves and formulas which can be used for any loading condition. A rapid and accurate design method for plate girders with constant cross section is then proposed. It is also shown how this design can be extended to allow for limitation on girder height, flange curtailment, and discrete values of plate thickness. The study indicates that significant savings in material can be achieved when optimum girder proportions are employed instead of the widely used hot rolled steel sections.

AB - A nonlinear finite element model is developed to analyze reinforced concrete slabs under monotonically increasing loads. The nonlinear variations in material properties through the depth of the slab are considered. Slabs are modeled as incrementally elastic, anisotropic plates. Axes of anisotropy concide with the slab yield lines. Concrete is modeled as a nonlinear material in compression and as a linear brittle material in tension. Steel is represented as a uniaxial material with a bilinear stress-strain curve. Two reinforced concrete beams and three reinforced concrete slabs are analyzed and compared with test data. The ability to represent cracking as a continuous process is a strong point of the model and is significant in obtaining a good match with experimental results. The increase in concrete strength due to biaxial compression has little effect in modeling the behavior of reinforced concrete slabs.

AB - Stage-deck-jacking consists of jacking a length of precast deck onto the steel girders. This liberates the casting bed which can then be used for a second length of deck. The formwork is placed either at one abutment in line with the bridge or at midlength. Sliding shoes placed at regular intervals reduce the friction between concrete slab and steel flanges. Steering of the deck is achieved by auxiliary transverse jacks equipped with rollers. Work schedules on the site generally follow a weekly cycle. Friction and jacking forces generate additional stresses and strains in the steel structure. The bending moments caused by uniformly distributed friction forces are indicated for a continuous beam with n spans. This construction method could be further improved. Some items for future development are mentioned.

AB - The operation of two large and dense weather networks to record and measure rainfall and hailfalls in two urban areas have yielded interesting weather-damage information that may need to be considered in certain structural designs. The Illinois State Water Survey operated a network of 250 hail sensors and recordings raingages in a 2,000-sq mile area surrounding St. Louis during the 1971-1975 period in a study to learn how cities affect the weather with special attention to effects on rainfall. The survey also initiated a multiyear project to study rainfall and hail distribution in the Chicago region with 300 recording raingages and hail sensors in a 4,000-sq mile area. The data from these networks give unique information on the time and space occurrences of rainfall and hailfall rates and amounts. During the operation of these networks two instances of roof collapse have come to our attention without any special efforts to collect such information. Quite possibly, more such roof failures occurred and we were not aware of the occurrences.

AB - In civil engineering practices, there are many structures where surfaces, either curved or plane, remain in contact with one another. In such cases the contact stresses depend on interfacial slip which can significantly affect the overall behavior of the structure. In some prevalent systems such as composite steel-concrete beams, layered wood construction connected with nails, rock joints, and rafted and shell foundations, the assumption of rigid interconnection between the contact surface is questionable. In numerical analysis of such jointed and layered systems using finite elements, the introduction of interface elements has proved to be the most useful.
