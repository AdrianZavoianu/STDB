AB - A summary of responses to a questionnaire sent to bridge designers and owners in the United States, Great Britain, Europe, Japan, and Canada is presented. Features of the response include overall geometry of the structures, such as radii and span lengths. Other information, such as bearing design, diaphragms and special construction considerations, is also considered. Empirical equations are fitted to the data to define the enclosed area of box and area of bottom flange plate at supports of continuous spans. Specific details as to stiffening and the influence of fatigue are discussed. This paper provides a summary of many of the aspects involved in the design of curved box girders, with the intention that this information will aid in the development of future designs when this category of structure is selected.

AB - A summary of studies conducted to investigate the static and dynamic behavior of curved steel box-girder bridges is presented. Included are descriptions of methods of analysis, experimental studies, computer programs, design aids used in practice, research in progress, and recommendations for future research. It is concluded that significant work remains: (1)To develop practical design aids that are based on research to date; and (2)to convert existing computer programs for analysis into design-oriented programs.

AB - A method is presented to calculate, approximately, the ultimate deflection of a reinforced concrete slab subjected to a point load at the center. This deflection is divided by the yield deflection, calculated by an approximate, but widely used method, to obtain a permissable ductility ratio for the slab. This ratio is useful in approximate dynamic analyses of slabs subjected to impulsive and impactive loadings. The method presented for the calculation of ultimate deflection takes account of the compressive strength of the concrete, the yield strength of the steel, the ratios of tensile and compressive steel in a cross section of slab, and the slab geometry. Thus, it is presented as a rational replacement for the empirical equations in current use. Comparisons with test data indicate that the method presented is reasonable and conservative.

AB - Guidance for the designer of cladding on urban buildings is contained in referenced material and in design criteria. Test data reflecting resistance of window glass (several thicknesses and temper levels) to small missile (roof gravel) impact are included. These data are incorporated into glass design charts. Definitions of three zones for design are advanced. Requirements for design of cladding suggest the use of protective screens on lower floors, tempered glass on middle floors, and conventionally designed glass on upper floors. Examples of failures and examples of successful protective designs are included. Data, design curves, and references contained in the paper should assist the designer who recognizes unusual environments when designing cladding.

AB - The ultimate behavior of concrete structural members was predicted based on the knowledge of the concrete and the steel stress-strain curves and using nonlinear computerized methods. The calculated values of ultimate moment and curvature were compared with some experimental values for beams and columns. The properties of the concrete compression block at ultimate were obtained for normal weight and lightweight concretes of compressive strengths varying from 3,000 psi to 13,000 psi, for beams with varying amounts of tensile and compressive reinforcement and for axially and biaxially loaded columns. The calculated values of the compression block parameters were in general favorable with the ACI recommended values. Some unusual effects of high strength on the value of concrete strain at ultimate and on the ductility of the reinforced sections are noted.

AB - Cylindrical shells made of cold formed deep profiles or corrugated steel sheets are analyzed, using the theory of orthotropic shells. The governing equations and solution are modified to correct a deficiency of a previously reported solution, especially for shells supported along their four edges. Improved solutions are obtained by: (1)Accounting for the effect of the transverse shear forces on the condition of equilibrium in the radial direction; and (2)applying a particular solution that satisfies the governing equations. The modified solution is valid for long shells and converges to that of simple arches with the increase of length of the shell. Also, an experimental program is undertaken and the comparison shows good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results.

AB - The finite strip method is used to study the local, distortional, and flexural-torsional modes of buckling of I-beams bent about their major axis. The interaction between these modes is investigated. The buckling loads so determined are compared with those derived using the simpler but approximate theories normally used to design against specific buckling modes. The effect of lateral and torsional restraints on the buckling modes is investigated. A design chart for the local buckling stress of I-beams subjected to major axis moment is presented.
