AB - The power of the procedure lies in the reanalysis of large continuous systems when local modifications or re-sizings are made. The example problems demonstrate that the analyst chooses the degree of approximation by the number of normal modes selected to represent the continuous system. If very few modes are used, inaccuracies can be expected in the solution, but may be reduced by selecting more modes. Currently, the procedure is being extended to include area modifications. For example, an area stiffness modification with an infinite magnitude may represent a clamped edge. The stacking of systems can permit one to save computer time, if a complex structure can readily be broken into a number of simple components. This permits an analysis similar to component mode synthesis techniques.

AB - The prototype bridge is a 1,300-ft (400-m) span box-girder type with a horizontal radius of 1,500 ft (458 m) and supported on 48 cables individually anchored to the canyon walls. The model scale selected was 1/200 and a distorted model was constructed to study the global behavior of the system to ground shaking applied in all three coordinates. Preliminary testing included the measurement of static live-load response, system damping, and natural frequencies and mode shapes. These are compared with the results of linear analysis. Shaking tests were conducted on a 20-ft x 20-ft (6.1-m x 6.1-m) two-component table. The principal dynamic behavior is shown in the form of time-history plots of selected quantities, and maximum response values are compared with linear analysis. It is concluded that linear analysis provides dynamic response data accurate enough for design purposes, that cable vibrations have little influence on the gross behavior of the system, and that the system damping is not appreciably affected by the cable system.

AB - In this paper, possibilities of identifying important engineering characteristics of the structures using selected inspection and test results are examined. Recently, methods of system identification have been used to obtain a set of differential equations or generalized impulse response functions for the representation of the dynamic behavior of a given structure. It is suggested herein that the characteristics to be thus identified can include such functions as the damage and reliability of the structure at the time of the test and inspection. The general problem of structural identification is formulated and considered. The literature on damage function and reliability functions of structures are reviewed and summarized. Possible applications of various testing procedures including nondestructive and proof-load tests for structural identification purposes are also considered. Finally, the potentially practical implementation of such a methodology is suggested.

AB - An extensive live load survey is conducted on a medium size hospital to provide data and illustrate the technique of inventory surveying. A preliminary survey defines room uses and major sources of load. Recording forms are then constructed and manufacturers' literature consulted to construct transfer functions. Results are presented in the form of frequency histograms grouped according to general region use. Three regions (diagnostic and treatment, patient rooms, and surgery) have approximately the same loading characteristics, while laboratory loads are about double. Present design loads for hospitals are seen to be approximately equal to the 99 percentile of the survey load. The relation of survey load to lifetime maximum load depends on the frequency of load change and the characteristics of the extraordinary load, both of which are a function of the particular room use. All region uses exhibit a relationship between floor area of a room and mean load.

AB - A method to determine the elastic buckling strength of imperfect closed polygon columns has been developed. A set of eight equilibrium equations was developed but was reduced to a set of four equations by eliminating the displacements at a typical midpoint node. Typical corner displacements were expanded by Fourier series and a 4 x 4 stability matrix was obtained. Matrix size was independent of the number of sides of the closed polygon. Design curves are given for representative imperfections and geometric parameters for several different polygon shapes.

AB - A nonlinear finite element model is used to predict the short-term behavior of reinforced concrete slabs under transverse service loads. The model is based on small deflection plate bending theory and uses a layered 16-degree-of-freedom rectangular plate bending element. The sources of material nonlinearity in reinforced concrete slabs are examined and accounted for in an incremental nonlinear solution procedure. Various methods are considered for treating the tension stiffening effect that occurs between the cracks in the tensile concrete in regions close to the reinforcement. Numerical calculations are used to assess the relative merits of these methods and to test the validity of the model. A simple treatment of the tension stiffening effect is proposed in which a modification is made to the tensile stress-strain diagram for the reinforcing steel. This produces accurate results with relatively economic use of computer time.

AB - A lower bound method has been developed for the limit design of indeterminate concrete structures subjected to torsion. In this method, a stress resultant field that satisfied all the statical equations is first assumed in terms of the reduntants. An equation required to solve for the reduntants is then formulated. To obtain the additional equations, several techniques are suggested. Finally, the cross sections must be proportioned and detailed for the assumed stress resultant field using ultimate strength design procedure. The method is applied to the case of symmetrically loaded helical stairs with fixed supports. A numerical example is included to illustrate the method.

AB - By using the Merchant-Rankine formula and its logical extensions it is possible for the designer to better appreciate the design process. He is able to exercise his engineering judgment by the choice of buckling coefficients in the elastic equations, and to establish the forms of instability to be considered. All that will be required of the Code Committees is to decide on values of n. Further studies might indicate that n can be related directly to specified imperfections.
