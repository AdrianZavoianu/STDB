AB - A simple, rational approach is presented for developing thermoelastic continuum plate models for large repetitive double-layered grids subjected to arbitrary temperature distribution. The continuum plate models are characterized by their thermoelastic strain energy from which the equations of motion and constitutive relations can be derived. The procedure for developing the expression for the thermoelastic strain energy of the continuum involves introducing basic assumptions regarding the variation of the temperature and displacement components in the thickness direction, and obtaining effective thermoelastic coefficients of the continuum in terms of the material properties and geometry of the original lattice structure. The high accuracy of the continuum plate models developed is demonstrated by means of a numerical example of a square inclined double-layered grid.

AB - Several competitive numerical integration techniques for nonlinear dynamic analysis of structures by the finite element method are examined and compared for a plane stress problem. Both material and geometric nonlinearities are included in the finite element formulation. Three explicit methods are investigated: (1)Central difference predictor; (2)two-cycle iteration with the trapezoidal rule; and (3)fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. A nodewise solution technique is generated at any state in the analysis. Three implicit methods also are studied: Newmark-Beta method, Houbolt method, and Park's stiffly-stable method. Among the three explicit methods, it is concluded that the central difference predictor is the best, whereas the performances of the other two methods are about equal. The three implicit approaches are nearly equal, but Park's stiffly-stable method is somewhat better than the Newmark-Beta method, and Houbolt's procedure must be rated third.

AB - Over the last decade the Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment (AIDJEX) at the University of Washington has been modeling the air-ice-water regime of the Arctic and checking the results by field observations. As a product of this work extensions to the understanding of ice mechanics and the interaction of ice on structures have resulted. These results are scattered in the scientific literature but those that may be of practical value are reported in this paper. The particular areas dealt with using elastic and plastic material models, are the failure modes of ice sheets, fracture theory force, the mechanics of ridging and ridge dimensions, the prediction of pressure fields and their effects on structures and the onset of ridging.

AB - A finite element representation for a cable subject to steady airflow is developed. Quasi-steady aerodynamics consisting of normal and tangential components is used. The model results in nonsymmetric stiffness matrices and thus admits the possibility of both static and dynamic instabilities. A demonstration problem is worked in terms of certain nondimensional parameters. This problem exhibits good stability behavior.

AB - A series solution has been developed to analyze continuous skew orthotropic plate structures subjected to laterally applied uniform and concentrated (patch) loads. Various practical skew angles, flexural rigidity ratios, aspect ratios, torsional rigidities, and span ratios are considered. The analysis is verified and substantiated by tests on model structures. A design example is given using the charts generated.

AB - Determination of the critical stress parameters for local buckling of a plate assembly, such as a cold-formed structural profile or a folded plate structuree, involves the solution of an eigenvalue problem of a family of linear partial differential equations. Excepting a few classical cases, numerical methods are required for solution. For the common practical case that the properties are constant in one direction of the plate, a separation of variables method is given which reduces the problem to a one-dimensional iteration and quadratures. Proof of convergence is given. A modification of Newmark's method for buckling analysis is indicated. Examples show rapid convergence, good accuracy, and suitability for manual computation.

AB - The purpose of this note is to show that the earlier analytical work can be readily extended to cover the case of an inclined cable hanging under self-weight. In particular, suitably nondimensionalized natural frequencies of the symmetric in-plane modes will be shown to depend on just one dimensionless parameter, while the frequencies of the antisymmetric in-plane modes and the out-of-plane modes are independent of any parameters. Such findings are restricted to cables the profiles of which differ little from those of their chords. However, such a constraint is of little consequence since structural efficiency will almost invariably dictate a profile that is flat relative to the chord. Subject to this restriction the results apply to any chord inclination, from horizontal to vertical, and are straightforward to use.

During the first football games of the 1975 season the upper stands of the new Iowa State University (ISU) football stadium were instrumented with displacement transducers and the dynamic response was recorded. An analytical effort was undertaken to explain several observed phenomenon in the dynamic data. An approximate forcing function for crowds on a football stadium was deduced.

AB - The purpose of this paper is to present some formulas that can be used to check the aerodynamic stability of the more typical bridge members having two axes of symmetry. The principal task consists of finding the natural frequencies of those members whose shear center and centroid coincide and therefore vibrate in uncoupled modes. Oscillation is generally due to vortex shedding which in turn causes an alternating force to act on the member. The frequency of the vortex shedding increases with the wind velocity. When it coincides with the natural frequency of the member at the critical… wind velocity, resonance occurs and the amplitude of vibration may reach its maximum value for a stable member. With further increase in velocity, amplitudes may increase to failure by galloping for an unstable member. It is important to know that vortex shedding causes the member to vibrate in bending in the direction transverse to the wind.
