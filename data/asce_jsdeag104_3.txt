AB - A method is presented for constructing plastic sandwich shell structures by which it is possible to accomplish the majority of the construction with the shell in a flat configuration and then deform it into some desired curved configuration. The resulting shell structure is studied experimentally at 3/16 scale, ½ scale, and full scale to determine structural response to load, construction feasibility, and construction practicability, respectively. Experimentally determined structural responses of the 3/16 scale model are compared to the results of a finite element analysis of the shell.

AB - A unique, practical structural steel system that possesses many advantages in the seismic design of structures is described. The system employs diagonal bracing with large eccentricity between the brace-beam connection and the beam column joint. The eccentricity provides a ductile fuse that yields in shear and prevents brace buckling. Static and dynamic analyses indicates that this system can perform well during earthquakes, because it combines the stiffness of a braced frame with the excellent energy dissipation of a moment-resisting frame. One-third-scale experiments showed that the system behaves as predicted in the analyses. It dissipates large amounts of energy while maintaining a very stiff structure, and it offers many potential applications in the seismic design of structures.

AB - A progressive collapse is a chain reaction type of failure which follows damage to a relatively small portion of a structure. Progressive collapse constitutes an unacceptable hazard in many buildings, and thus procedures for its control should be incorporated in building standards. Design strategies for reducing the risk of initial failure and for controlling the amount of damage that occurs are presented and their relative advantages are covered. Design criteria are given for the reduced loads to be carried by a damaged structure.

AB - The present American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' (AASHTO) fatigue specifications, and earlier versions of these specifications, have generally resulted in conservative bridge designs. However, the specifications originated before much information was available on the actual stresses in bridges and on the variable-amplitude fatigue behavior of bridge members; therefore, they do not accurately reflect the fatigue conditions that actually occur. A new method of designing highway bridges against fatigue is presented. This method more accurately reflects actual conditions and would permit the engineer to design for any desired weight distribution and volume of traffic. Although the development of some parts of the method are complex, the method is simple to use and could be incorporated into the AASHTO specifications as illustrated in the paper.

AB - The adequacy of a concrete trial section and the determination of the minimum necessary prestressing steel area for a prestressed concrete requires the satisfaction of multiple design criteria. These equations can be linearized through the use of a reciprocal prestressing force factor in the working stress equation and piecewise linearization of the ultimate strength and maximum reinforcement conditions. These data can be postulated in matrix form for input to a standard linear programming optimization computer code, and the optimal prestressing area can be determined. An example shows the application to a routine design.

AB - Traditional design of steel columns is analyzed with a view towards actual and assumed factors of safety. It is shown that due to the variation of strength that is caused by the randomness of the column strength parameters, the real margins of safety differ from what is prescribed by the design specifications. A study of several typical column shapes shows that realistic factors of safety vary between 1.4 and 2.1, as compared to the assumed values of 1.67 to 1.92. Column design improvements are evaluated, and it is shown that an approach that involves the use of several (multiple) column curves is particularly feasible. The development of such curves in the United States is described, and it is shown that the differences between real and assumed column strength values will be significantly diminished. The traditional factor of safety concept is analyzed, and an alternative approach suggested that will lead to consistent and uniform levels of safety. This development is put in perspective by a formulation that allows its use in load and resistance factor design.

AB - Solutions are obtained for inelastic buckling of I-shaped beams of structural steel and the relationship between unsupported length and the extent of flexural deformation sustained at the onset of buckling is examined. The load consists of a uniform moment. End conditions assumed include full fixity, free rotation about the minor principal axis with restrained warping and free rotation about the minor axis with unrestrained warping. The extensional stiffness is obtained from a theory that considers partially yielded steel to consist of an inhomogeneous mass consisting of unyielded steel and steel which has passed into strain hardening. Of the parameters examined, the minor axis radius of gyration divided by the yield stress appeared to best correlate unsupported length with the amount of flexural deformation sustained at the onset of buckling. Restraining warping at the ends of simply supported beams significantly suppresses their tendancy to buckle.

AB - An investigation is presented into the question of whether series of extreme wind speed data in climates not subjected to hurricane winds are best fit by Type I or Type II extreme distributions. Statistical evidence is adduced supporting the assumption that the Type I distribution is an appropriate model of the extreme winds. The question is also examined of the magnitude of the sampling errors inherent in various methods of estimation of the N-year wind. It is shown that the method of moments, Lieblein's order statistics method, and the method of least-squares probability plot fitting are, for practical purposes, equally acceptable in engineering calculations. Numerical examples are presented illustrating the order of magnitude of the sampling errors in the estimation of the N-year wind for various confidence levels and for various values of the mean recurrence interval N.

AB - A method is developed based on a linearized theory and the finite-element method. The method involves two distinct steps: (1)Specification of the potential and kinetic energies of the bridge, (2)use of finite element technique to: (a)discretize the structure into equivalent systems of finite elements; (b)select the displacement model most closely approximating the real case; (c)derive the element and assemblage stiffness and inertia properties; and finally (d)form the matrix equations of motion and the resulting eigenproblems. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the applicability of the analysis and to investigate the dynamic characteristics of laterally vibrating suspension bridges. This method eliminates the need to solve transcendental frequency equations, simplifies the determination of the energy stored in different members of the bridge, and represents a simple, fast, and accurate tool for calculating the natural frequencies and modes of lateral vibration by means of a digital computer.

AB - The displacements and rotations of joints on the exterior (corner) columns are independently expressed in terms of a set of functions with undetermined coefficients (generalized coordinates). Floors are assumed to be rigid in plane. Interior joints on different levels are constrained to displace vertically and rotate in the same manner relative to the exterior joints at the corresponding levels. Transformation matrix connecting the actual joint displacements to the generalized coordinates are then derived from the joint compatibility conditions. The obtained generalized structure stiffness matrix has order significantly lower than that in standard frame analysis. A 26-story, 3-bay frame was analyzed using 24 generalized coordinates and the errors are generally less than 5% and 10%, respectively, for the displacements and internal forces.

AB - When measurements of stress-strain in a prestressed concrete structure are made, extraneous strains due to creep and shrinkage of concrete and relaxation of steel are also recorded. In the presence of these extraneous strains, the significance of making the measurements for surveillance of grouted tendon containment structures is critically examined from a statistical standpoint. The discriminating power of stress-strain measurement schemes to unmistakably detect the occurrence of abnormal losses in prestress due to various causes, including corrosion, is expressed in terms of power functions. The measurements of stress or strain by meters cannot be relied upon for detection of abnormal situations which may arise due to excessive corrosion of tendon steel. Elaborate instrumentation for the purpose of surveillance seems unnecessary.

AB - The ultimate flexural strength behavior of isolated square tapered and beam-slab reinforced footings are presented. Yield line solutions are developed for generalized contact pressure distributions and the influence of taper, beam size, fillet size, negative moment capacity, and contact pressure distribution on the collapse load is brought out. In beam-slab footings the optimum relative beam capacity required to make the beam rigid is indicated. Results of experimental investigations on footings resting on sand reveal that tapered (with isotropic as well as with alternative reinforcement patterns) and beam-slab footings exhibit superior structural behavior in terms of normalized first crack load, collapse load, relative rigidity, relative efficiency, and failure mechanism.

AB - A method of cable analysis has been developed which is both simple and accurate and gives an excellent appreciation of the nonlinear behavior of cables under gravity loads. The method is a trial-and-search procedure in which the initial value of the cable horizontal tension is calculated, and then for increasing values of horizontal tension, the magnitude of the corresponding applied load in the desired configuration is deduced. The computation, which can be readily handled on a small desk-top computer, clearly reveals the load-deflection behavior of the cable. A flow path of the method and several examples are included.

Important parameters are shown to be the slenderness of the tee section on the compression side of the hole, the length of the hole, and, especially for circular holes, the moment-to-shear ratio. Comparison of test results is made with theoretical results based on a plastic analysis in which buckling is assumed not to occur.

AB - The problem of large forces acting over limited contact areas of concrete is one of frequent occurrence in engineering deign. In three earlier papers, the effect of several important variables on concrete bearing strength was considered in some depth. However, the specimens reported therein and elsewhere by other authors were all of uniform cross section with vertical sides. In practice, instances also occur where the sides of the supporting members are sloped from the loaded ends. Typical examples are: concrete rocker bearings; piers; footings; and sometimes the end blocks of prestressed concrete elements. Little data are available on the bearing strength of splayed specimens or specimens of variable cross section in the transfer zone of the concentrated load. The present report gives in substance the test carried out by the writer on plain concrete blocks having two or more sloped faces and loaded through bearing plates of various sizes and shapes.
