AB - A method of analysis and design of rectangular and circular elastoplastic, reinforced concrete, and slabs resting on a Winkler-type foundation is proposed in this paper. The method is an application of the yield-line theory of structures and gives upper bounds of the true limit loads. It is very simple and flexible so that realistic slab and loading configurations can be easily accounted for. The results of the method for a circular, centrally loaded slab agree with the ones reported by other researchers for a Winkler foundation, while of much interest is the comparison with the results for an elastic half space.

AB - A procedure to find an economical design of homogeneous I-beams following the AISC (1973) specification has been presented considering the limitations imposed by the available plate thicknesses. Both stiffened and unstiffened beams are considered. A method is presented to find the flange plate cut-off points for the minimum weight design. Design charts are provided to readily find economical dimensions of an I-beam. Examples are given to illustrate the procedure.

AB - The diagonal compression field theory for symmetrically reinforced concrete beams monotonically loaded in shear at sections where flexure is unimportant, is presented. This theory assumes that after cracking the concrete can resist no tension and that the shear will be carried by a field of diagonal compression. As well as considering the equilibrium conditions that relate the average stresses in a beam to the applied loads the theory considers the compatibility conditions that exist between the average strains in the various directions. Expressions are given which enable the shear deformations (and thus the effective shear modulus) of diagonally cracked reinforced and prestressed beams to be calculated. Based on a suggested failure criterion for diagonally cracked concrete, equations for the shear capacity of reinforced and prestressed beams are derived. A design chart based on these equations is given.

AB - Earthquake responses of cable trusses with top cable curved up and bottom cable curved down and diagonal web members are the main subject of this study. Such trusses have special features as diagonals come in and out of action during vibration. An outline of nonlinear analysis of static and dynamic problems of elastic cable trusses were presented and results checked with published examples. For limiting the degrees-of-freedom, only plane trusses are studied herein with masses lumped at the joints. Analysis of an example truss is presented. The truss is pretensioned so that it will have very small deflection under dead load and there will be sufficient tension in the lower cable to stabilize the structure when line load occupies whole or half the span. Deflections and member forces of the example truss subjected to vertical and horizontal (north-south) El Centro earthquake are given.

AB - Developments in computer software have made many programs available for more exact high-rise space frame design. However, in practical structural engineering design such programs may be too expensive and time consuming especially for the preliminary design. This paper presents a simple, yet reasonably accurate method to solve problems of lateral load distribution among the different frames of a high-rise building by simple programming using small computers. The cantilever method for approximated lateral load analysis is incorporated to derive the flexibility and the stiffness matrices of each frame. By the method presented, the lateral loads are distributed among the frames according to the approximate stiffness matrix of each frame and the final sway of the building can be found. This method can also be used for buildings with a combined system of frames and shear walls.

The analytical models developed in the past decade for predicting the ultimate strength of plate girders including the contribution of longitudinal and transverse stiffeners are reviewed.
