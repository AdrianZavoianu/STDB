AB - A stress analysis is accomplished for pontoon-type floating roofs loaded by given volumes of rainwater. The unique equilibrium position for the loading is found by appropriately matching equilibrium positions for the circular inner membrane and the outer ring-shaped pontoon. The numerical solution of the coupled, nonlinear differential equations for the membrane requires the stipulation of several parameters at the center. A systematic procedure is developed to determine these parameters and the resulting overall equilibrium position and thus internal forces and stresses. The results for typical design configurations of several different tank diameters are presented and analyzed. The effects of varying the volume of rainwater and the density of the supporting fluid are also investigated.

AB - A review of the results of the long-term research work is presented. The theoretical basis of this study is the three phase structural concept. Structural and mathematical modeling of phase components, — namely, soil, foundation, and superstructure — is covered. The elastoplastic halfspace approach is adequate to simulate the state of displacement of soil media. A three-dimensional structural analysis is required to describe the stiffness response. Tranversal flexural rigidity of the structure is derived from the height. Since soil and concrete have viscoelastic-plastic properties, loading history according to the erection process and time history following consolidation phenomena, have been investigated. Local measurements carried out on full scale models have shown a close correlation with the calculated results.

AB - An iterative numerical procedure has been developed to analyze flexible transmission lines of arbitrary configuration. Conductors, ground, or guy wires are included as cable elements interconnected at linear or nonlinear supports. A single efficient subroutine determines the cable elements end forces, geometrics, and tangent stiffness matrices. Convergence of the procedure is very rapid as documented by two computer programs. Examples including broken conductors, unbalanced ice loads, longitudinal, or diagonal wind are presented. The procedure is absolutely general and can be extended to two-dimensional analyses of cable nets.

AB - Results are presented for an experimental and analytical study of steel column base plates subject to axial loads. A total of 19 tests with the plates placed on concrete cubes and with loads applied only to the central portion of the base plate have demonstrated that the design approach in the present American Institute of Steel Construction Specification for the Design, Fabrication and Erection of Structural Steel for Buildings is conservative. Based on the tests, an expression is presented for determining the average bearing stress at failure as a function of the concrete strength, the ratio of concrete to plate area, and the ratio of the distance between the loading member and edge of plate to the thickness. The results of other investigations are used to set limits to the proposed method.

Stability relationships have been developed for jibs with uniform, tapered, and parabolic chords and design formulas have been derived for determining the effective length factor in each case. Reference is also made to solutions for the out-of-plane case.

AB - Nuclear power plant facilities and many other structures need protection against missiles generated by tornadoes and explosions. Empirical formulas are presented to determine the local effects on concrete barriers. Calculated depth of penetration, and thickness to prevent perforation and scabbing have been compared with all available results for full-scale simulated tornado-missile tests. The comparisons are excellent. The tests included missiles of various sizes, shapes, materials and impact velocities. The target properties also varied significantly. The new formulas can predict the local effects of missile impacts better than any other existing set of formulas.

AB - A study is presented of the potential of constrained viscoelastic layers in enhancing the damping of two-way slab floor systems with simply supported and clamped boundary conditions subjected to dynamic loading. The finite strip method is extended to the analysis of the resulting sandwich structures. The damping of the sandwich system is mainly due to the shear deformation of the viscoelastic layers and is described by a composite loss factor. Results are presented which demonstrate the effect of the elastic, damping, and geometric properties of the attached layers as well as their location in the domain of the slab, on the damping of the structures considered. Substantial damping can be achieved by proper choice of these parameters.

AB - Criteria and design solutions for seismic restraint of mechanical and electrical equipment in buildings are not standardized among building codes, industry standards, and engineers. A review is made of the effect of earthquakes on mechanical and electrical equipment and of selected codes and standards, emphasizing those in California. Seismic restraint must be compatible with the need for some mechanical and electrical systems to be free of the structure for reasons of thermal movement and vibration control. Finally, suggestions are made for distribution of responsibilities among mechanical and electrical engineers, structural engineers, equipment manufacturers, and contractors.

AB - The formulation of a variational virtual work equation for describing internal work for an arbitrary thin-walled beam of open cross section subjected to large displacements is reviewed. The equation is specialized to treat I-sections and is discretized by the finite element method in terms of twelve displacement coordinates per node. A procedure for solution with inelastic material properties (Shanley theory) is examined in detail, as well as some programming considerations. Solutions for a trilinear stress-strain relationship, including the effect of residual strains, are compared with experimental results. Good agreement is obtained for inelastic biaxial bending of a beam-column and for inelastic lateral buckling of a beam.

AB - In two earlier papers a simplified method was presented for the analysis of the stress distribution in framed-tube structures subjected to bending and torsion. By replacing the discrete structure by an equivalent orthotropic tube, and making simplifying assumptions regarding the stress distributions in the structure, simple closed-form solutions were achieved, and design curves presented, for three standard load cases. Provision was made in the analysis for the inclusion of individual corner columns, since in many practical situations these are considerably stiffer than the others. The object of this note is to complete the analysis by developing corresponding formulas for the horizontal and vertical deflections, and the rotations, of a framed-tube structure subjected to standard bending and torsion load cases.

To this end, a rational method is presented for the selection of mean recurrence intervals that tend to insure consistent levels of safety for structures subjected to wind loads.

AB - Slab-column structural systems are often analyzed for lateral loads imposed by earthquake or wind by assuming that an effective width… of the slab acts as a beam. The usefulness of this approach is attested to by the large number of publications that have approach is attested to by the large number of publications that have appeared on this subject. Current finite element technology makes it possible, in principle, to analyze the original structure. However, unless one has access to a structural analysis program with substructuring capabilities, the cost, both in data preparation and in processing time, makes the analysis very unattractive economically. Even in those cases where a more exact analysis may be desirable as a final check, the effective width concept is useful in the preliminary design stage.
