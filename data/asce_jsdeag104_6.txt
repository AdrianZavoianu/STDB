AB - Parametric study of axially loaded steel members with symmetrical rotational end springs (connections) was performed. The main parameters are the connection flexural strength, the effective slenderness ratio, and cross-sectional properties. The rotational end spring is a simulation of the end restraint due to flexural rigidity of the connections of an axially loaded (bracing) member. The member with balanced strength connections, i.e., where plastic hinges form simultaneously at midspan and at the ends, is more efficient with respect to compressive load and energy dissipation capacities than members of the same length and same cross-sectional properties with nonbalanced strength connections. The hysteresis behavior of a balanced strength member can be adequately represented by that of a pin-connected member of the same cross section and same effective slenderness ratio.

AB - Eighteen specimens made from 1 in. (25-mm) square tubes with welded gusset plates were tested under repeated axial loading. Length of the specimens varied from 20 in. to 54 in. (510mm to 1,370mm) and their slenderness ratio varied from 30 to 160. The objective of this investigation was to study the effects of connection flexural strength and stiffness and change of member length on the hysteresis behavior. From the parametric study it was concluded that the hysteresis behavior of flexurally restrained axial members is most influenced by a single parameter — the effective slenderness ratio. The results were compared with recent theoretical predictions and were in excellent agreement for members of larger slenderness ratio, yet with some slight differences. Other observations are that the maximum compressive load decreased and member length increased with number of cycles.

AB - The stiffness matrix and the influence values of the fixed-end actions of a prismatic circular-arc I-Section segment are derived from the exact solution of differential equations of the bar. Effects of warpage restraint are automatically accounted for. Thus, the method provides exact values at the nodal points of a finite element stiffness formulation. The cross section may be composite. The loading may be concentrated and nonuniformly distributed over part or whole of the segment length. Therefore, the girder need not be segmented further on account of loading. Derivations given in the paper will facilitate solution of single- and multi-span circularly curved girders acted upon by out-of-plane loads by the displacement method.

AB - An extensive experimental investigation to determine the fatigue strength of deformed reinforcing bars was recently completed by the Portland Cement Association. This work was sponsored in part by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP). The experimental program was carried out with each test bar embedded as the main reinforcing element within a concrete beam. Test variables included size of beam, size of bar, grade of bar, bar deformation geometry, minimum stress, and stress range. A total of 353 tests were carried out. This paper describes the test program and the design provisions developed by statistical procedures from the test data. An example of the application of the provision in bridge design is presented in an appendix.

AB - An experimental study has been conducted to determine the effectiveness of the epoxy repair method for full-scale timber trusses. A series of Pratt trusses (constructed of primarily new lumber) and a series of Fink trusses (taken from Old Air Force buildings being demolished) were tested. The testing procedure consisted of an initial load test to failure, followed by a second load test to failure after epoxy repairs. For the new timber trusses, the epoxy repair restored the trusses to approximately their original condition. The repair was marginally successful for the old trusses that were badly rotted. It is thus recommended that if repairs are made to rotted trusses, all joints should be repaired, even when not visibly damaged, since rot can be serious on the interior around split rings. The epoxy repair method was found to be effective for most common truss failures: broken members, end splits, at bolt and split ring connectors, and longitudinal splits in members.

AB - After demonstrating that traditional design procedures are unrealistic, a method for design of concrete gravity dams to remain essentially within the elastic range of behavior is presented. All factors that are significant in the dynamic response of dams are considered and the capacity of concrete to support dynamic stresses in tension is recognized. In designing dams for the very intense ground shaking that may occur only rarely in highly seismic areas, limited cracking of concrete may be permitted. However, at the present time it is not possible to analytically predict, with high degree of confidence, the extent of cracking and damage that a concrete gravity dam may experience during very intense ground shaking. The research needed to improve these analysis procedures and to incorporate them in the design process is identified. The procedure presented in this paper for design of concrete gravity dams to be built in seismic regions is also applicable to evaluation of the safety of existing dams.

AB - The experimental phase consists of quasistatic cyclic load tests on one-third scale model subassemblages of the lower three stories of an 11-story, three-bay frame with infills in the two outer bays: (1)Frame members (particularly the columns) are designed for high rotational ductility and resistance to degradation under reversed cyclic shear loads; (2)gradual panel degradation is achieved using closely spaced infill reinforcement; and (3)panel thickness is limited so that the infill cracking load is less than the available column shear resistance. The analytical phase consists of developing relatively simple, macroscopic mathematical models for predicting the experimentally observed bare and infilled frame behavior. The infilled frame model is found to give excellent predictions of observed response. It is concluded that the model developed and the procedure used can be applied to the analytical prediction of the response of large, engineered infilled frame structures to severe lateral forces.

AB - An analytical method is proposed to calculate an expression of the gust loading factor taking into account the nonlinear fluctuation pressure terms, for elastic structures with N degrees-of-freedom, loaded by a random wind. In this method, the Fourier transform technique of the probability law and the Edgeworth's series are used. A numerical example shows the influence of nonlinearity in the presence of resonant amplification effects.

AB - Load carrying capacity of a flexural member is significantly increased if the horizontal displacements of the ends of the member are restricted by suitable end details and support conditions. This phenomenon has been acknowledged by previous investigators. A horizontal force is developed at the level of restraint due to the restraint in horizontal displacement of the ends of a beam.
