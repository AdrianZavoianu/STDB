AB - A finite element formulation for nonlinear viscoelastic analysis has been synthesized with direct application to the problem of silage-silo interaction as a typical example of farm silo analysis. The formulation is based on basic theories in continuum mechanics and employs a single integral constitutive relation for nonlinear viscoelastic materials. This nonlinear formulation has been found, through its applications, to be a more versatile and accurate scheme when compared with the conventional piecewise-linear viscoelastic finite element formulations. Among the other features of the formulation are its capability of taking prescribed load, simulating incremental construction and its convenience in incorporating the silage-silo wall interface friction mechanism. The devised formulation was applied to predict stress histories, deformations, and resulting capacities produced during sequential loading of a 24x70-ft top unloading drained silo, using materials' constitutive functions that have been previously established through triaxial creep tests on corn silage.

AB - In a reinforced concrete spandrel beam, reduction in torsional moment can occur due to redistribution of internal actions after cracking. As a result, design based on the conventional elastic method has often been found to be uneconomical. In the present study, four different methods of design are investigated. The investigation consisted of testing seven T-shaped specimens. These specimens represented the spandrel-floor beam system both at the midspan region and the region near the support of a continuous spandrel beam. The results obtained from the tests are examined and the amount of steel required by different methods are compared. It is found that the ACI method gives the most desirable and economic design for the entire length of the spandrel.

AB - The paper suggests a beam element model for nonlinear analysis of concrete frames and arches. Nonlinear behavior and cracking of concrete, yielding of reinforcement bars, large displacements, and nonconservative loading effects are considered. Time-dependent creep effects are also included. A model for bond slip of reinforcement bars is proposed. Several examples show good agreement with analytical and experimental results reported in the literature. The present method is efficient and has proved to be a very useful tool in design of concrete structures.

AB - An alternative to minimizing the weight of a cross section for a specified load is to maximize the load capacity of a structural member of a specified weight. General conditions for equivalence of maximum load design and minimum weight design are given, and advantages of the former are pointed out. Application of the method to cold-formed channel beams results in general optimal relationships that can be expressed in very compact dimensionless form. It is concluded that in order to realize the maximum benefit of flange stiffening the web should also be stiffened. The optimal lip stiffener has a depth equal to the code minimum. Continuous spans are sometimes inferior to multiple single spans, and do not affect optimal profiles appreciably.

AB - The results are presented from an experimental study of beams subject to web buckling in a region of pure bending. Two sets of sections were tested, one with the neutral axis at the center of the web and one with 6/10 of the web area in compression. It is shown that the web buckling reduces the ultimate strength and that the post-buckling strength accounts for a significant portion of this reduced strength. Based on these tests, an analytical approach is presented for predicting the ultimate strength of beams under the above conditions. The beam cross section is reduced to an effective section. The method is not limited to those sections studied.

AB - The draft of that part of the proposed British Unified Bridge Code dealing with composite construction has recently been completed. The writers were primarily responsible for the formulation of the shear lag rules included in the Code. This paper gives details of the content, the origin, and the calibration of these rules. The longitudinal bending deflections and stresses of many girders are markedly affected by shear lag. It is therefore important that the bridge designer should have available suitable comprehensive information to enable him to allow for shear lag effects in design calculations.

AB - Horizontal forces, such as wind, are resisted by the walls parallel to the wind direction. These forces, which lie in the plane of the wall, are known as the shear or racking loads, and are transmitted to the sheathing through the fastener system. Qualification of sheathing materials has generally been limited to performance testing of 8-ft by 8-ft (2.4-m by 2.4-m) stud wall assemblies. An analytical procedure has been developed that accurately predicts racking strength based upon the lateral resistance of the individual fasteners. The structural model is applicable to any sheathing size or geometry, so it is possible to determine the racking strength of light frame walls from simple lateral nail tests or small scale racking tests. The procedure offers a direct means for designers and code officials to predict racking strengths of panels incorporating various sheathing materials and fasteners.

AB - The results are presented of an investigation into the behavior of pin-ended composite columns containing more than one steel component. A series of tests was performed on built-up composite columns containing two steel channels with and without battens and encased in unreinforced concrete. Comparative tests were made on similar unencased columns. An iterative inelastic analysis for composite columns has been developed to predict their behavior right up to collapse. Comparisons between theoretical and experimental behavior were made. The observed results confirm the analytical predictions and lead to the conclusion that the absence of battens does not detract from the load-carrying capacity of built-up composite columns of the type considered.

AB - Current design practice in the United States for unbonded post-tensioned flat plate structures is partially based on the assumption that the stress in the post-tensioned tendons at the time of flexural failure can be predicted using the equation given by the American Concrete Institute (ACI) Code for stresses in beams. However, data from recent tests of a number of thin flat plate structures and of beams having comparable span-depth ratios show that this is generally not valid if the span-thickness ratio is about 45, or more. The purpose of this paper is to present the test data and to demonstrate that an additional factor, the span-depth ratio, l/d, needs to be introduced into the prediction equations for ultimate steel stress in unbonded post-tensioned members.
