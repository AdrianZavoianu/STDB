AB - Seismic zoning maps previously used in building codes in the United State have not considered the frequency of exposure to earthquakes in different regions. By combining available data on tectonics, regional geology, and seismicity new maps of the contiguous United States have been drawn based on the assumption of uniform risk exposure. Maps are presented for two quantities, effective peak acceleration (EPA) and effective peak velocity-related acceleration (EPV). These two quantities are then taken from the maps to obtain the lateral design force coefficients to be for the design of earthquake resistant structures. The development of these maps is the first portion of a major review of seismic design procedures.

AB - Motivated by optimization problems in which it is sometimes convenient to neglect constitutive equations and work with force systems that only satisfy equilibrium, the additional constraints imposed by the use of constitutive equations are considered in this paper. It is shown that the question of the existence of structures that reproduce a given equilibrium system can be posed as a problem of linear systems and that Farkas' Lemma is central to its solution. The effect of pressure is also considered.

AB - Variable node coordinates are considered for the case of minimum weight design under two alternative loading systems of simple ideal trusses. Optimality Kuhn-Tucker conditions are derived and used as the basis of two optimization methods. The first extends existing work on iterative design. The second uses a decomposition procedure combined with a gradient method.

AB - Results are compared to the experimental response of a 9-story steel frame model tested on the Univ. of Calif., Berkeley, Calif., shaking table. The uplifting response is compared to the response for the same excitation with overturning ancharage provided, demonstrating a considerable reduction in the applied loading for the uplifting case. Extrapolation of the test results to a theoretical prototype frame indicate that a significant uplifting response would occur during a moderate, credible earthquake, even though not indicated by even conservative current building code seismic provisions. A rational consideration of the uplifting behavior is shown to be compatible with the concept of dual seismic loading criteria; a service loading that should produce no damage, and a maximum credible loading that should not result in catastrophic failure. A design including a rationally planned uplifting capability should stand a much beetter chancee of surviving a maximum credible earthquake in a functional condition.

Examples are given of the design of a fully stressed section, a symmetrical I section, and a tee section.

AB - The development in construction technology has led to a trend toward constructing rather flexible structures whose design involves certain problems as safety, human comfort, and increased risk of damage. A solution to these problems consists to a certain extent in the application of structural control by using active or passive control mechanisms. The advantages encountered in using active control mechanisms to control the structures' response have led to various attempts in applying active control theory to civil engineering structures. The implementation of the control force, the choice of the proper type of the control device and its components, and the interaction of some modes of vibrations and its effect on the behavior of the controlled structure are being studied in this paper. A simple span bridge subjected to a deterministic, moving load is taken as an example.

AB - A method for the in-plane analysis of clay masonry walls is presented. The proposed finite element model reproduces the nonlinear characteristics of masonry caused by material nonlinearity and progressivee joint failure. Masonry is considered as an assemblage of elastic brick continuum elements acting in conjunction with linkage elements simulating the mortar joints. The joint elements are assumed to have high compressive strength (with nonlinear deformation characteristics), low tensile strength, and limited shear strength depending upon the bond strength and degree of compression present. The material properties for this model are determined from uniaxial tests on bricks and masonry panels. Tests on a masonry deep beam are used as a basis for comparison between predicted theory and experimental evidence.

AB - Computer software implementation of finite element structural analysis methods is examined from the viewpoint of software quality and design concepts. Concepts of software engineering relevant to finite element software are reviewed, with emphasis upon ideas of modular programming systems. Examples of well-designed software along such lines are surveyed including recent promising work in Europe. The need for more software design considerations in finite element education is examined. Thee future prospects for finite element software development are assessed with regard to both funding and source of development. It is concluded that coordinated development and exchange of software modules in a well-defined modular programming system environment has the potential, in terms of existing design concepts, for reducing the cost and duplication of effort, and increasing the quality, of future finite element structural analysis computer tools.

AB - Interactive graphics is, without a doubt, a useful tool in teaching computer-aided analysis courses. This does not only apply to the area of finite element analysis and structural design, but goes beyond that to any method providing results best understood in graphical form. The experience of using GIFTS in the finite element course has been gratifying and the intention is continue continuee its usage in the future. It is not only helpful in teaching the course but also provides valuable feedback to the program designer. Valuable systematic studies of the behavior of finite element models can be achieved by the combined ingenuity of the students, the capabilities of the program, and the hardware on which it is run.
