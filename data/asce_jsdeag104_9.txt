AB - Load and Resistance Factor Design criteria for steel building structures were developed from first-order (second-moment) probabilistic principles in a research project described in this paper. The underlying assumptions, the probabilistic basis, the calibrations process, and the final format are examined. Specifically, the paper concerns itself with the background and the choice of the particular first-order model, with the data bases used in evaluating the loading and the resistance functions, the choice of the safety index, and with the final selection of the load and resistance factors. Load combinations and serviceability as well as maximum strength criteria are tested.

AB - The bending strength of rolled steel beams, as it is affected by flexural-torsional buckling and local plate buckling, is examined using probabilistic concepts. Design equations are recommended φ factors developed. The results indicate that the design recommendations in all ranges of behavior have reasonably similar reliabilities, so that a single φ factor can be used.

AB - An intensive investigation of the strength and behavior of steel beam-columns has been carried out with a view towards the development of load and resistance factor design (LRFD) criteria for such members. Since the solution for general beam-column is a very complex problem, thee first part of the paper gives an outline of the deterministic bases for the analysis of beam-columns, considering laterally supported and laterally unsupported members. Major attention is paid to the development of resistance factors for beam-columns, whereby the random nature of their strength is accounted for. Utilizing theoretical and experimental results, it is shown that a beam-column resistance factor of 0.86 may be used for uniaxially loaded members. For biaxially loaded beam-columns the resistance factor may be set at the conservative figure of 0.80, which reflects the scarcity of test results for such members.

Resistance factors and expressions for nominal resistance are developed for plate girders in flexure, shear, and combined flexure and shear.

AB - Methods are proposed for the computation of flexural strength of composite beams and for design of shear connectors based on limit states of plastic strength. Both fully and partially composite beams with formed steel deck or flat soffit slabs are considered. LRFD resistance factors are derived using a first-order second-moment probability analysis. Linear plastic strength equations for partially composite beams and a direct design procedure for the steel section and shear connectors are presented. Also treated are effective slab width, beams under construction, and approximate formulas for effective moment of inertia and section modulus of partially composite beams.

AB - Design criteria based on the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) approach must include a treatment of connections. The nominal resistance and resistance factor terms for the principal structural steel fastening elements (welds, high-strength bolts, and ordinary bolts) are developed. Sufficient statistical information relative to the development is given so that a critical evaluation of the choices presented can be made. The work shows that current design values for different connectors provide substantially different levels of reliability.

The mean and the coefficient of variation of different load variables are derived using available meteorological data. The load variables identified are the lifetime maximum wind pressure, the annual maximum wind pressure, the daily maximum wind pressure, the annual maximum snow load, and lifetime maximum snow load. The load factors to be applied on each of these loads are also derived.

AB - The building column design procedure should take into account the effect of frame instability. This effect can be considered by use of the effective lengths of the columns or by application of P-Delta forces. For a selected class of frames and loadings, the effect of frame instability may be ignored. Use of the effective length of columns is a reliable procedure provided that satisfactory approximations of the effective lengths of the columns can be calculated. These calculations must consider any nonsymmetry of building properties and loads, material yielding, connection flexibility, and support conditions. Application of P-Delta forces is an approximate, direct, working stress design procedure applicable to both regular and irregular frames in combination with possible complimentary bracing systems. The approximation has been verfied for a limited class of structures and use of a conservative factor of safety is recommended. Selected frames and limitations for which instability effects can be ignored are summarized.

AB - If temporary structures having lives of 2 yr-5 yr are designed using criteria for permanent structures with lives of 50 yr-75 yr, overly conservative design can result. This paper presents a systematic, rational basis for developing criteria for glued-laminated timber temporary bridges and buildings. Second moment reliability theory, which requires estimates of the mean and coefficient of variation of resistance and load, is used to compute measures of safety, called safety index values. These index values are computed for permanent and temporary structural elements. Allowable stresses for temporary structures are determined by choosing corresponding safety index values that will provide adequate safety relative to the safety of permanent structures, while reflecting the temporary nature of the structures. Examples of how allowable flexural stresses are developed for bridges and building are given.

AB - A method for analyzing tall framed buildings based on the concept of equivalent elastic membrane is presented. The elastic properties of the membrane are evaluated taking into account the effects of finite size joints and axial deformations in the columns. Floors are assumed to be rigid in plane. The equivalent membrane is then analyzed using two-dimensional plane stress, specially orthotropic finite elements. The displacements thus obtained represent directly those of the actual structure, and the member forces are determined by integrating the corresponding stress components in the membrane. Two multistory multibay frames were analyzed, and the results show that a high degree of accuracy can be obtained with significantly smaller number of unknowns than by the exact and other simplified methods. The present technique can be readily applied to the static and dynamic analysis of tubed structures, clad multistory frames, and shear wall and frames structures.

AB - An equation for the elastic local buckling stress of unstiffened compression elements is derived using an approximate wave form for the solution of small deflection equation of plates subject to membrane stresses. Von Karman's fourth-order partial differential equations for large deflection of thin plates with initial out-of-plane imperfections are solved, using the approximate wave form, to study the post-buckling behavior. The elastic and inelastic local buckling and post-buckling solutions obtained from the analytical study are compared with test results of members with unstiffened compression elements. Simple equation for the post-buckling effective width is derived through a parameter study.

AB - An examination is made of the stability of a cylindrical air-supported membrane supporting a central line load and subject to ponding by a fluid in the hollow so caused. A critical value of the central load is shown to exist and its value is obtained by a numerical analysis. Results from the analysis indicate that low profile air-supported structures should be less liable to failure by this mode of collapse than inflatables with a semi-circular profile. However, under normal operating pressures even the latter require loads of the order of 400 N/m (27 lb/ft) in the presence of water to cause collapse of structures with a span of 50 m. Nevertheless designs should be examined carefully in view of possiblee pressure reductions coinciding with internal or external roof loadings.
