AB - Flexural members that are reinforced by steel fibers for only a portion of their depth, referred to as being partially reinforced, can have strengths and ductilities equal to those of members reinforced for the full depth and at a considerable saving in costs. Beams 3-in. (76-mm) deep, reinforced with 1.5%ch by volume of 0.5-in. x 0.0058-in. (12.7-mm x0.15-mm) fibers on only the tension side to a depth of 0.5 in. (12.7 mm) or more have strengths comparable to a fully reinforced member but with slightly reduced ductility. The cost of materials for beams reinforced to one-sixth of their total depth is only about one-half of that for a fully reinforced member.

AB - The application of steel folded-plate structures has been advanced by the use of cold-formed steel metal deck. The Task Committee on Folded-Plate Structures of the Committee on Cold-Formed Members has prepared an extensive bibliography of folded plates. These types of structures are classified by categories of form and structural action. The possible types of supports are illustrated. A selected bibliography on methods of analysis is included covering exact direct solutions, hand computational solutions, and influence coefficient methods for simply supported prismatic folded plates. Also included is a selected bibliography for analysis of continuous folded plates, multiple folded plates, nonprismatic folded plates, and buckling solutions of folded plates.

AB - A method is presented for the automatic generation of the required basic mechanisms for use in a limit (collapse) analysis of a planar structure. Constraint equations are written to ensure rigid body motion of all members and at the same time releases are introduced in a systematic fashion. The set of equations thus generated may be solved resulting in a set of basic mechanisms. These mechanisms are expressed in terms of the assembled structure's external degrees-of-freedom so that some additional modification is necessary to put them in the usual form of relative deformations for each member. The procedure only requires the joint geometry of the structure and the member connectivity. The method is therefore ideal for programming and removes the necessity for hand generation of the basic mechanisms in a limit analysis.

AB - An exact expression for the mean upcrossing rate of a sum of two poisson square-wave process representations of stochastic loading functions is used to explore the accuracy of an earlier approximation (due to Wen) of the extreme value distribution of such processes. The approximation is found to be accurate over a broad parameter range despite the fact that it ignores the randomness of load durations and implicitly assumes very infrequent load events. The limits of the mean upcrossing rate as an approximation to the extreme value distribution are also studied.

A parameter study was conducted on 168 connections for 559 loading conditions, by two-dimensional finite element analysis. Special features of the computer program and modeling are described. From the results, a prediction equation has been generated by regression analysis, to give the connection rotation as a function of the beam and plate dimensions, bolt sizes and location, and material properties. Comparison of predicted and experimentally observed results is presented for a typical case. Practical applications of the findings are covered.

AB - This paper presents an investigation designed to study the effect of the presence of torsion of the flexural rotational capacity of spandrel beams. Test results from fourteen identical L-shaped beams and fourteen identical rectangular beams, of normal weight concrete, in which the ratio of moment to torque was varied, between pure moment and pure torque cases, show that the presence of torsion reduced the flexural rotational capacity. This reduction is significant even for torque/moment ratios as low as 6%. The flexural rotational capacity of beams subject to combined bending and torsion may be evaluated by multiplying the rotational capacity of an identical beam under pure bending by a reduction coefficient. The calculated results using this method compare very well with the experimental results. The same reduction coefficient should be used in the case of continuous spandrel beams to reduce the allowable percentage of moment to be adjusted according to ACI 318-71 Building Code.

The effect of cable pretension and the location of the cable attachment point on the buckling load of the tower is also evaluated. The curves, in addition to giving a direct solution for the critical load of the tower, indicate that there are two regions of behavior. One in which the tower strength is best increased by increasing the stiffness of the cables and a second region in which the strength of the tower can only be increased by increasing the stiffness of the mast.

The mathematical models employed are classified to identify their distinctive features. Demonstration problems consisting of a beam, a beam column, and a frame are presented to evaluate the computer code SINGER, which is based on a one-dimensional finite element expressed in the form of an energy function. The solution process centers on function minimization. Comparisons between computed and experimental results indicate, in general, good to excellent agreement. Some discrepancies are encountered, and likely causes are cited.

AB - A model for mild steel is proposed for use in inelastic analysis of frames. The model is characterized by a stiffness degradation factor, α, and a yield stress growth factor, β. These are obtained by fitting the model to results of uniaxial experiments, which are in turn used in a frame analysis program FRAME 63. The proposed material model has potential application to simulate the special features of mild steel in monotonic and reversed loadings. As a particular case, it represents Masing type of inelasticity, and another version, i.e., Masing inelasticity with stiffness degradation.

AB - Earthquake responses of a 17-ft 4-in. (5.29-m) tall three-story steel frame structure were produced in two series of shaking table tests: (1) Yielding initiated in the panel zones of joints; and (2) yielding occurred exclusively at column and girder ends of the structure. The test data are used in the development and verification of analytical proedures. Mathematical models are formulated by first defining the element properties and then assembling them to obtain the system properties. Panel zone deformability, bi-linear strain-hardening plastic hinges, and foundation flexibility are considered in modeling. The model with its parameters rationally determined either analytically or experimentally proves to be adequate in predicting both global and local response histories of the structure undergoing elastic and inelastic seismic responses. Since the predicted local deformations are found to be very sensitive to the specified yield mechanisms, it is concluded that the prediction of damage level in typical seismic response analyses of structures cannot generally be exact.

It is the purpose of this technical note to present a technique that can be used systematically for the selection of size, location, and sag of parabolically draped cables, once the shell proportions are fixed. Following the work of Kirsch for the optimal design of prestressed concrete plates, it is seen that the optimization problem here is linear and may be successfully solved by an application of the Simplex programming technique.

AB - An analytical model for postcracking compliance of rectangular reinforced concrete beams under combined torsion, bending, and transverse shear is established using the skew bending theory. The case of small transverse shear and the case of large transverse shear are treated separately based on widely accepted failure modes. Expressions for small transverse shear are identical to those obtained in a previous work using a space truss model which assumed zero transverse shear. These expressions show good agreement with tests. The interaction between torsion and large transverse shear predicted by the proposed model is verified by available experimental results.

AB - The diaphragms considered in this study are of the type frequently met in box girder bridges supported on single slender piers. The outside loads are assumed to be transmitted from the bridge main girders to the inclined (or vertical) surfaces of the diaphragms in the form of uniform shearing forces. Three locations are considered for the prestressing forces applied to resist the tensile stresses and forces due to load. Other variables are: height, ratio of opening width to diaphragm span, width of supporting column, and slope of the sides of the diaphragm. The normal and shear stress distributions along horizontal zontal and vertical sections are plotted for a few typical cases. Nomographs have been developed for determining the critical stresses and resultant forces due to external loads and due to prestressing forces acting at various locations.

The focus is on features of the seismic and accident behavior that may affect adversely the containment safety role. The behavior is described probabilistically under a range of accident and seismic conditions extending far beyond design levels. The individual effects of seismic and accident events are analyzed, as well as the coupling of those effects for the various possible timings of the causative events. Reliability estimates are obtained by combining probabilistically described damage with a probabilistic description of the causative events. A large number of uncertainties are included, and the final reliability estimates reflect the total uncertainty—including the statistical component—faced by the safety analyst.

The iterative two-level approach that is mainly intended for large systems consists of dividing the structure into smaller substructures, optimized independently at a first level. Forces and displacements along the intersections of the substructures are held constant during the first-level solutions but are optimized at a second level. All intermediate solutions of the first-level problem are feasible and thus the optimization iteration can always be terminated with a feasible solution. In general, decomposition can be performed in different ways. Criteria for successful formulation are established, for which simple and efficient solutions are obtained. The method might prove useful in different optimal design problems of trusses, frames, and beams. Numerical examples demonstrate the application of the method to a variety of problems.
