AB - In order to provide adequate barrier thickness against impact by projectiles, or to determine required projectile characteristics for penetration of a given barrier, it is essential to have a technique to calculate the depth of penetration by a projectile. Existing empirical formulas on penetration of steel barriers leave out several important parameters that influence the effects of missile impact. An empirical formula is presented for the determination of projectile penetration into steel barriers. Recommendations are made for the determination of residual velocity after perforation of a barrier. The case of multiple barriers is also considered.

AB - This paper explores the effect of uncertainties in the information regarding the ground-motion statistics during an earthquake, and finds that they are large enough to preclude sufficient confidence from being placed in many predictions of earthquake resistance. It recommends that the usual all-probabilistic approach be replaced with a suitable combination of probabilistic and worst-case analyses. It finally reports on a study in which this combination was explored. It appears to be sufficiently successful to encourage consideration of the combined approach.

AB - The accuracies of currently available formulas relating the statistics (mean and standard deviation) of instanteneous intensity of sustained live load to those of lifetime maximum value are examined. A method based on a Gauss-Markov model for the sustained live load in multistory buildings is proposed. It is found that the mean lifetime maximum equivalent uniformly distributed load for columns of multistory buildings may be greater than that of the single-story case, but the differences are small (within 4 psf).

AB - Limit design of orthotropically reinforced concrete slabs can be carried out by means of the yield-line theory. The method, in general, is quite cumbersome. It can be simplified by taking advantage of a linear relationship between the total yield moment capacity of the slab and its collapse load. This linearity is demonstrated for slabs with unsymmetrical boundary conditions. It is shown that changes in geometry, boundary conditions, and coefficient of orthotropy will only change the slope of the graph, not its linear character, and that changes in the ratios of positive to negative reinforcement have little or no effect on the collapse load.

AB - The behavior of selected low-rise steel buildings subjected to earthquake base motions has been studied, and recommended techniques for the earthquake resistant design of low-rise buildings have been presented. The seismic response of buildings of practical proportions when subjected to seismic response of buildings of practical proportions when subjected to seismic excitation was determined using inelastic time-history analysis. Practical methods of analysis, specifically the modal method and the quasi-static building code (equivalent lateral force) approach, have been evaluated for use in estimating seismic response. For practical design purposes it is suggested that the quasi-static approach for calculating shear distribution, overturning moments, and displacements be employed. Practical guidelines leading to building design that can resist earthquake base motion with an adequate margin of reserve strength are presented. The study demonstrates that it is possible and desirable to employ modern principles of earthquake engineering for low-rise buildings with simple framing systems.

AB - The creep properties of organic coated and uncoated No. 6 deformed steel reinforcing bars, embedded in concrete prisms, were measured for 2 yr with corresponding tensile stresses in the bars at the loaded ends of 15,000 psi (103 MN/m2) and 30,000 psi (206 MN/m2). Twenty-four reinforcing bars were included in the tests, consisting of: 18 bars coated (in duplicates) with nine different epoxy materials; two bars coated with a polyvinyl chloride material; and four uncoated reinforcing bars. Reforcing bars coated with six of the epoxy materials developed slip-time relationships (creep) after 2 yr of testing that were nearly the same as those for the uncoated bars. The remaining epoxy coated bars were judged to have poor creep properties. The excessive slip of the polyvinyl chloride coated bars in the concrete should preclude their substitution for uncoated reinforcing bars in concrete. The relative performance of some coated reinforcing bars in the creep study were different than those obtained in earlier pullout tests.

AB - Test specimens consisting of a steel column stub and composite steel-concrete beam are tested under cyclic loading. The results show that composite beams subjected to cyclic loading exhibit stable hysteresis loops and good ductility. The behavior under negative moment is governed by the local buckling of beam flanges and web. Beams with horizontal web stiffeners or stocky webs show marked increase in ultimate strength and ductility under negative moment.

AB - Members of prismatic plate assemblies subjected to longitudinal compression can under certain conditions develop compressive stresses in the transverse direction due to Poisson's effect. This can cause significant reductions in the buckling stress of the assembly. A general finite strip method which computes the prebuckling stresses as a preliminary is employed to analyze the problem. The worked examples point to the existence of an analogy between the development of transverse compression in the members of the plate structure and temperature stresses in the bars of a plane framework. A simplified buckling analysis which calculates the transverse compression using the analogy is found to give very accurate results.

AB - The equivalent frame method for analyzing reinforced concrete buildings described in the ACI Building Code Requirements (ACI 318-77) is suitable for analyzing single stories for gravity loading only. A new procedure that permits using the equivalent frame concepts for the analysis of multistory buildings for both lateral and gravity loads is described. Limited verification studies show the method predicts lateral deflections that generally agree with measured deflections. Comparisons of the new analytical procedure with conventional plane frame analyses made using effective slab widths are given. Problems and limitations in applying the method in plane frame and space frame analyses are reviewed.

AB - With increasing dimensions of the cooling towers built of reinforced concrete, the buckling behavior becomes crucial in the proportioning of the shell. Ring stiffeners prove to be most effective in this respect with up to four stiffening rings the so called optimal position provides the highest efficiency. After five rings the equidistant positioning becomes effective as well. However, after a value of approx 6 this ratio doesn't influence the buckling load because the local buckling between the stiffening rings becomes decisive. The quality of the numerical analysis is checked by calculating the buckling loads obtained in tests on stiffened hyperboloidal models. The deviation between the theoretical results and experimental values is approximately the same and about 0.83 both for unstiffened models and stiffened models with five or nine rings. Also the high efficiency of the rings with ring depth to shell thickness ratio of about 6 could be verified.

Seismic and aerodynamic responses of the two versions of the bridge, a steel and a concrete, as finally designed are presented.

AB - The finite element method was used to model and analyze two cylindrical shells-one nail fastened and one glued-taking into account geometric and material nonlinearities. Earlier tests on the particular three layer membrane used for the shells provided values for the various elastic constants for both nailed and glued fastenings. In the case of the nailed fastenings, the in-plane shear stress-strain behavior was found to be markedly nonlinear while for the glued fastening the shear behavior appeared to be reasonably linear. In the case of the nailed shell, the exponential expression for the in-plane shear stress-strain behavior was adjusted in order to treble the shear stiffness. For the glued shell, parabolic and exponential expressions were fitted to the experimental shear stress-strain data in order to permit extrapolation; both expressions were suitable at lower loads but the parabolic one lead to considerable error at high loads.

The recommendations are based on an elastic analysis of perforated web plates, together with empirical relationships that define the inelastic buckling loads. Comparisons are made with previously reported experimental results. A parameter study is described, based on the recommended buckling curves, which enables conditions to be established defining ranges of hole geometry and web slenderness within which web instability can be ignored. Special attention is given to beams with web slenderness typical of beams used in building structures.
