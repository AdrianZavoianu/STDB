AB - The elastic behavior of biaxially bent beams has been considered previously by some investigators (6). Lee (6) used a laborious trial-and-error equilibrium procedure. Harrison (3-5) investigated the plastic behavior of redundant mild steel beams of circular and rectangular cross sections subjected to noncoincident mutually perpendicular concentrated transverse loads in the span. The laboratory tests for a number of beams, however, showed substantially higher collapse loads than those predicted indicating the possible presence of strain hardening and higher order effects.

The results of an experimental study on single-span indeterminate beams with an I-shaped cross section are presented here. The experimental work, conducted to verify the theoretical analyses as well as to gain insight into the physical behavior included the development of a testing apparatus and subsequent tests on a series of beams.

AB - The strength of unbraced, multistory, flat-slab buildings subjected to a combination of gravity and lateral loads can be investigated by limit analysis methods. A particularly useful method for analyzing the flexural strength of the slab and of the slab-column joints is the yield-line theory. From such an analysis it is also possible to obtain the limiting moments for which the columns must be designed in order to assure that at the collapse load all yielding will take place in the ductile slabs rather than in the more brittle columns. In what follows equations will be derived to permit the analysis of such a structure and graphs will be presented to facilitate a design for the combined loading.

Although the coefficients have been used for more than 40 yr, their scope is severly limited and they generally lead to wasteful proportions of reinforcement in flexure.

AB - The inelastic behavior of reinforced concrete structures has been recognized for a long time (l,19), while related research efforts extended over half a century (4,8,21) have clarified an important number of problems. Yet, despite the abundance of available theoretical and experimental data, the wide adoption of inelastic concepts in structural design remains a rather elusive goal. This is illustrated by the modest use of these concepts in the elaboration of structural norms and standards for the design of reinforced concrete structures.

AB - In the 1977 manual of recommended practice for the design of fixed offshore platforms (2), the American Petroleum Institute (API) stipulated more stringent seismic design requirements than it had in the past. Earlier design criteria were based on an elastic strength approach, and the levels of seismic design forces were compa:rable to those used for important onshore structures. The new recommendations require a platform to remain stable under rare and intense earthquake motions capable of imposing displacements twice those considered using the earlier criteria.

These advancements in process have produced good understandings of the behavior of buildings and other structures under the effects of extreme winds. Further, these understandings have advanced far enough to permit their use in applied research activities and in professional practice.

The design of laminated composite structural members has been based normally on empirical results; the static analysis of laminated beam has been based mainly on elementary theory. Krajcinovic (6) presented a theory by variation approach suitable to analyze sandwich beam with arbitrary boundary conditions and top and bottom layers of equal thickness.

Analytical solutions for several simple cross sections can be found in standard texts (e.g., Refs. 5 and 6). Due to difficulties encountered in attempting to satisfy with closed form solutions the governing equations and boundary conditions of more complicated cross sections, including nonhomogeneous anisotropic bars, approximate analyses using numerical techniques have been developed (e.g., Refs. 2, 3, 4, and 7). There is a need for the same sort of analysis of curved members.

For the stayed column, theoretical equations were derived and numerical solutions were then obtained from the closed-form formulas. For the cable-stayed girder bridge, an energy method requiring the prior assumption of a mode shape was used to calculate the overall buckling load of the whole structure.

The main difficulty one faces in an intuitive approach is in satisfying the boundary conditions along the free edge and making the solution valid and efficient.

AB - In order to save headroom in modern high-rise buildings it is often necessary to provide holes or openings at different positions in beams. These openings permit a passage for service ducts. If the beam is subjected to torsion, its torsional strength must be checked or the region near the opening should be reinforced adequately to eliminate the weakness. It has been observed (5,8,9) that by providing suitable reinforcement, it is possible to have large openings in reinforced and prestressed concrete beams subjected to bending and shear.
