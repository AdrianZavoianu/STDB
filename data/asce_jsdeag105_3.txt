AB - The study of the natural frequencies and modes of vibrations of suspension chains and cables has interested researchers for over a century and a quarter. Some of the earliest works were carried out by Rohrs (11) in 1851 and Routh (12) in 1892. Both of these studies treated the uniform inextensible chain or cable. Additional work was carried out by Rannie and von Karman (IO) in 1941, by Pugsley (9) in 1949, and by Saxon and Cahn (13) in 1953.

AB - The selection of structural members for high-rise buildings is normally based on allowable-stress design methods. The analysis for gravity loads presents no special problems. Lateral loads on a building, such as wind and earthquake forces, are usually applied to planar bents only. In the preliminary design simplified methods such as portal frame and cantilever method are used (3,6).

AB - The assignment of realistic values to the loads that a structure will have to carry is perhaps the least precise phase of design. This paper examines the nature of the floor live load process, which is comprised in general of all nonpermanent gravity loads, including furniture and equipment (books, paper, tables, mechanical equipment, etc.), people, and movable partitions. Not included are special heavy equipment, such as computers, since these loads would normally receive special considerations by the designer.

AB - Wide-flange beams that are loaded in the plane of their minor axis and that have element width-thickness ratios that preclude plate buckling will fail either when lateral-torsional buckling occurs or when the material strength is reached. These possibilities are well documented, with design approaches available (8, 10). If a torque is additionally applied, such as would occur when the load is eccentric with respect to the minor axis, torsional stresses are created (5, 11). Present design practice involves adding vectorially the flexural and torsional stresses determined for each case separately. These are then compared with the maximum stresses determined for a beam loaded in flexure only. In doing this, the effects of interaction are neglected.

AB - In a building design team, the importance of a mutual understanding between the structural engineers and the architects is well recognized. Occasionally, a mutual understanding between the mechanical and structural engineers is lacking. Many times, the design team places too much emphasis on the functional and visual requirements of the occupancy, and overlooks the importance of the services behind the scene that support the functional requirements. It is quite common for the architects to allocate restricted ceiling to floor spaces ( ceiling cavities) and then ask the mechanical and structural engineers to work out the space problems between themselves.

This work is now well documented (1,2,9,10,11,12) and has resulted in design recommendations being introduced into proposed design codes (e.g., British Standards Institute (BSI)-Document 77/13908 DC) that allow for the enhanced strength associated w ith the post-buckling tension field.

AB - This work is concerned with the problem of prestressing of arbitrary space and plane truss-frame bar systems. The term “prestressing” means applying initial self-equilibrated stress states to the system by means of distortions that have the character of dislocations (imposed bar elongations) or disclinations (imposed rotations of specific cross sections). This method of prestressing differs from the conventional prestressing by means of cables, where different strength properties of matrix and cables are utilized.

AB - The advantages of using precast prestressed elements in construction have become apparent through research and testing done in various countries, notably in the United States, United Kingdom, Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic, and Germany. Some investigators substituted small-sized elements for conventional reinforcement in pavements, building and bridge slabs, rectangular concrete beams, columns, continuity connections, and other structures, such as the spiral pit. The main advantage of this production-oriented and economic material is that it can be used in places where direct prestressing is inconvenient or where flexural cracks must be controlled without affecting the moment redistribution capacity of the structure.

AB - The provision of holes in beams is sometimes necessary to accommodate services in buildings and to provide access to the inside of box beams. Headroom can thus be saved and the dead space in false ceilings can be put to economical use. The exact mathematical solution of structural systems incorporating such perforated elements is difficult and may not be just ified in normal design office procedures. The objective of the investigation described here is to provide experimental information towards evolving rational and simple design methods.
