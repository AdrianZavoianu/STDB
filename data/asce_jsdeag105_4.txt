AB - Recent trends in design standards development have encouraged the use of probabilistic limit states design concepts. This is in order to simplify the design process and render it consistent for different materials and construction technologies. The development of such criteria requires that a large amount of data be gathered for perusal by standards writing organizations. These data should provide a measure of performance or reliability of existing designs so that the standards group has a perspective of where different construction technologies stand with respect to one another. This paper contributes to the data base by assessing reliabilities associated with existing reinforced concrete designs and providing a brief comparison with steel designs.

AB - Probabilistic limit states design concepts have evolved over the past decade because of the potential that they afford for simplifying the design process and placing it on a consistent basis for various construction materials. Several different criteria formats have been proposed, which have the common feature that their various load and resistance factors have a reliability basis. Two such criteria for reinforced concrete design are examined in this paper. The development of practical reliability based design criteria is also illustrated. While these are consistent with appropriate measures of design uncertainty and reliability and have a well-established rationale, they retain the simple characteristics of existing criteria with which designers in the United States feel comfortable.

AB - A flexibility approach is combined with a neutral point (elastic center) analysis to assess effects of differential footing displacements on the structural behavior of arch culverts embedded in deep embankments. The program was applied to a 22-ft (6.7m) arch culvert surrounded by a layer of baled straw, at Cedar Creek, California, and provided good correlations between quasi-theoretical bending moments and barrel displacements and those determined experimentally with strain-measuring devices and photogrammetrically, respectively. Large arch footing rotations are inevitable during deep embankment construction, and produce tensile thrusts at the crown. Overburden forces produce moments that augment these tensile stresses at the crown intrados. Compressive thrusts at the crown, decreased by reduction of lateral soil stresses by the straw, are insufficient to neutralize these tensile stresses. Severe intrados cracking and bowstringing at the arch crown have been observed.

AB - A 22-ft (6.7m) arch culvert embedded in a highway embankment under 191 ft (58 m) of overfill was instrumented to evaluate the relative behavior of two structural sections subjected to two types of structure backfill: (1)Compacted structure backfill in contact with the extrados; and (2)backfill with a low modulus inclusion (baled straw) surrounding the arch barrel. Observations: (1)Soil stress-overfill functions were approximately linear; (2)soil stress profiles at the extrados differed from assumed design distributions; (3)soil stresses increased after attainment of maximum overfills over slideslope sections but not after embankment completion; (4)differential settlements of footings were small; (5)characteristic footing rotations significantly influenced structural behavior; and (6)neutral point analyses correctly assessed barrel moments, displacements and stresses, but axial thrusts appeared to be greatly influenced by thermal stresses

AB - Variations in cross-sectional dimensions and in the location of reinforcing bars in slabs, beams, and columns are reviewed. Normal distributions are proposed for these quantities. The effect of discrete bar sizes on the ratio of the furnished area to calculated area of reinforcement is also considered and modified log-normal distribution is proposed.

AB - A generalized theory of free torsional vibration for a wide class of suspension bridges with double lateral systems is developed, taking into account warping of the bridge deck cross section and the effect of torsional rigidity of the towers. The analysis is based on a linearized theory and on the use of the digital computer. A finite element approach is used to determine vibrational properties in torsion. Simplifying assumptions are made, and Hamilton's principle is used to derive the matrix equations of motion. The method is illustrated by numerical examples. The objective of the study is to clarify the torsional behavior of suspension bridges and to develop a method of determining a sufficient number of natural frequencies and mode shapes to enable an accurate practical analysis.

AB - Despite the major progress in the field, wide use of structural plasticity awaits the development of computer packages capable of handling a broad range of practical problems in a way similar to the use of the STRUDL system for elastic analysis. The paper presents a blueprint for such a package, called STRUPL, and details of an integrated subsystem for the analysis of inelastic structures, called STRUPL-ANALYSIS. The latter can be used for a variety of parameter combinations, i.e., inelasticity models, loading types, behavioral modes, and stress combinations. Load deformation characteristics at any loading level up to structural collapse can be predicted within the framework of a first-order theory. Basic problems are formulated as sets of linear equations or linear programming with restricted basis problems. The paper describes the theoretical bases, mathematical formulations of typical problems in plastic analysis, the computer program, and some numerical applications of the STRUPL-ANALYSIS package.
