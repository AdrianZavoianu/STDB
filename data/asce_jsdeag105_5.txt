AB - An approximate analytical procedure for calculating the local buckling coefficient of cold-formed steel members with stiffened and unstiffened plate elements is presented. The effect of partial plastification prior to local buckling, caused by initial imperfections, is included in an empirical manner. Equations and charts are given for design office use. The analytical results compare well with test results. An example calculation is presented.

AB - The procedure is based on a computer-aided iterative technique. It consists of two main phases: (1)A preliminary design phase, which is repeated until an acceptable preliminary design is obtained; and (2)a final design phase. Seismic design forces are found from an inelastic design spectrum employing a modal analysis technique. A weak-girder strong column design criterion is imposed and member design is based on a story-wise optimization procedure using a linear programming technique. Once a design is obtained, a series of linear and nonlinear structural analyses are carried out to evaluate in the preliminary design phase, the acceptability of the design, and in the final design phase, the reliability of this design. Two designs obtained by employing the optimization procedure and a design based on UBC seismic forces and conforming to the requirements of this code are compared with respect to volume of material required and to response characteristics. The use of computers allows alternate designs to be rapidly and economically formulated and evaluated.

AB - An important effect of water submersion on dynamic response of a structure is the increase in effective damping. The dynamic response of submerged structures is of interest to the nuclear power industry for reasons of operational safety during seismic and other dynamic excitations. In this paper, the added damping contribution that results from the viscosity of water and the dependence of the contribution on structural size are examined. Other factors considered are the applicable range of viscous damping with respect to displacement amplitude and, as far as damping is concerned, how far must neighboring members be from each other to respond as if in open water. An expression is derived for relating the damping value to structural size. Estimated added-damping values for representative fuel elements, fuel bundles, and main steam-pressure-relief-valve lines that are based on our derived expression for added damping are given.

AB - Measured frequencies of a suspension bridge were found to differ from those calculated by a wide margin. The discrepancies were found to be caused by sliding deck joints not sliding at small amplitudes, which affected the stiffness. When these and other minor effects were correctly modeled the agreement was excellent. Lateral-torsional coupled motion caused by a channel type cross-section was found to influence the position of the center of rotation, which has an effect on the aerodynamic behavior. Measured values of structural damping are given, and a comparison is made between approximate and exact methods of computing natural frequencies and mode shapes.

AB - In this study, the components of a multiple configuration small-scale horizontally curved bridge were constructed. Using these components, eight different horizontally curved bridge configurations were assembled, analyzed, and tested. In general, the results from analysis and test were sufficiently close to verify the three-dimensional method of analysis and computer program developed at Syracuse University, and the feasibility of using a small-scale multiple configuration model as a research tool to investigate internal forces and displacements in highway bridges. It was also determined that a horizontally curved bridge cannot be effectively analyzed by approximating the curved geometry with chords. If this assumption is made, the analysis will yield internal forces very close to the correct values but will underestimate the deflections of the bridge. Therefore, the stiffness relationship for horizontally curved members subjected to moment, shear, and torsion were derived and incorporated into the three-dimensional analysis and computer program.

Using the results from the model tests and classical theory an interaction equation was developed. This nondimensional equation can be used to expedite the load factor design of curved steel box girders.

AB - The finite strip method is extended and applied to the analysis of sandwich folded plate and cylindrical shell roofs supported on diaphragms. In addition to accounting for the transverse shear deformations in an orthotropic core, local bending and bending-membrane coupling effects in cross-ply laminated faces are considered. The formulation is presented in terms of the membrane, bending and coupling stiffnesses of the faces, and the transverse shear rigidities of the core. Displacements are approximated by assumed functions that satisfy the boundary conditions at the diaphragms and which provide the capability of imposing appropriate continuity conditions between adjacent strips. Sample results are presented for roofs with cross-ply laminated faces indicating the effects of bending-membrane coupling.

AB - The results of approximately 4000 published and unpublished tensile tests on deformed reinforcing bars are studied to obtain statistical relationships for various mechanical properties. The sample included No.3 through No.18, Grades 40 and 60, bars. The means and coefficients of variation of the mill test yield strengths were found to be 48.8 ksi (337 MN/m2) and 10.7% for Grade 40 and 71 ksi (MN/m2) and 9.3% for Grade 60 bars. Beta distributions were used to represent both of these sets of data. The static yield strength was found to be 3.5 ksi (24 MN/m2)) lower on the average than the mill test yield strength in both cases, with a coefficient of variation of 13.4%. The trend to lower yield strengths with increased bar sizes observed early in the 1970's was not present in more recent test data, apparently due to more stringent production control in recent years.

AB - The notion of a force-limiting device that has the characteristic of ideal elastic-plastic behavior is introduced and applied to the compressive chords of a two-layer parallel-chord space truss. Examples are used to illustrate the usefulness of force-limiting devices in providing a desirable overall truss load-deflection characteristic. The results illustrate the variation of load capacity of the trusses depending on the load level chosen for the force-limiting device. An analysis is given of the problem of scatter of pin-ended column peak loads, the scatter of forces in these trusses from the theoretical values, and the possible scatter in load capacities of force-limiting devices. The end result is that the brittle-type characteristic that is usually associated with strut buckling in trusses is replaced by the elastic-plastic characteristic of the member force-limiting device, with a consequent beneficial effect on overall truss behavior in the inelastic range.
