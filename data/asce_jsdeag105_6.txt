AB - The paper reviews current research on the effect of specimen size on compressive, indirect tensile and flexural tensile strengths, the stress-strain characteristics, and related quantities. The measured compressive and tensile strengths were observed to increase with a decrease in specimen size in all investigations. The nondimensional stress-strain curves in compression tests were noted to be homologous for prototype and model concretes. A higher tensile-compressive strength ratio is observed in smaller specimens. The effects of duration and conditions of curing compactions, shape of specimen, and other factors are reported. Techniques are suggested to select the cylinder size to evaluate the concrete compressive strength in a model specimen. To assist with the determination of size effects and standardization, the ACI Committee 444 on Models of Concrete Structures has recommended that model investigations should include compression tests on 2-in.×4-in. (50-mm × 100-mm) cylinders along with any other cylinder sizes used.

AB - An elastically orthotropic finite element model with uniform thickness is developed that simulates the behavior of a structurally orthotropic steel-deck-reinforced concrete slab. The elastically orthotropic model accurately predicts the uncracked behavior of previously tested steel-deck-reinforced concrete slabs. The linear, elastic, uncracked behavior of a single panel of a typical steel-deck-reinforced concrete slab is examined for simply supported and fixed boundaries. Deflections and bending moments for two-way flexural action are compared with similar values for one-way bending. An expression is proposed for computing the optimum aspect ratio for a given orthotropic steel-deck-reinforced concrete slab. This study indicates that it is feasible to consider two-way action in the design of steel-deck-reinforced concrete slabs.

AB - A parametric study of welded steel circular beam-columns is presented to assess the effect of residual stresses and the degree of end restraint on member behavior. The effect of external hydrostatic pressure on strength is also considered. Ultimate load capacities are determined by a general purpose beam-column program that provides the option of incorporating longitudinal residual stress patterns and nonlinear configuration of stress-strain relationships. A comparison is made between interaction diagrams developed with and without considering residual stresses for various end moment and fixity conditions. Analytical results are also compared with the AISC interaction equations for ultimate conditions.

AB - Cylindrical storage bins with flat bottom and conical roof have been analyzed for grain and wind loads using the equations of shell bending theory. Both the cases of static and flow grain pressures are considered. The cylindrical container and the conical roof are made of corrugated and plane steel sheets respectively. The boundary conditions at the top of the cone with a ring beam and the cone cylinder junction are derived from the principle of stationary potential energy. The governing equations for the isotropic cone and the orthotropic cylinder subjected to the appropriate boundary conditions are solved for the stresses and displacements using a numerical procedure of piecewise polynomials in conjunction with the partition method. For a considerable part of the cylinder the circumferential moment must be taken into account for an accurate calculation of the hoop stress. Also the stresses produced are much higher during the flow of grain.

AB - A detailed study of the effect of axisymmetric meridional imperfection in hyperbolic cooling towers is presented. The imperfection is represented by two conical frustrums connected at the middle of the imperfection. Approximate relationships to calculate the hoop forces and the meridional moment due to the imperfection have been derived. An approximate study of the effect of meridional cracks and reduced moment capacity of the shell on the forces in the imperfect portion is included to give an indication of the general behavior of the tower under those circumstances. Approximate expressions have been obtained to calculate the maximum allowable imperfection before serious increase in stresses can occur.

AB - Electrostatic precipitators are currently the key elements in air pollution control for coal-burning power generation plants. The finite element method appears to offer the only potentially competitive alternative to full-scale testing. The first attempts at using standard finite element methods, as contained in the SAP-IV computer program, to study and correlate with full-scale test configurations of precipitator plate systems is reported. It is concluded that finite element modeling is accurate and economic for capturing in-plane stress and acceleration behavior. Out-of-plane acceleration behavior is much more complex and requires additional research, but it can be said that qualitative parameter studies using finite element programs are clearly useful in this area as well.

AB - The spate of recent failures of glass claddings in modern high-rise buildings has called attention to the need for improved understanding of cladding static and dynamic behavior so that rational procedures for its design can be developed. To this end, a frame-panel finite element model was developed to represent a typical portion of the glass curtain wall between story levels in a 29-story glass-clad building and a parametric study of its displacement response and vibration properties was conducted. Window response was shown to be sensitive to the rotational stiffness of the gasket and flexural stiffness of the framing elements for selected panel aspect ratios. Vibration frequencies of the frame-window system were in good agreement with values obtained in field and laboratory experiments. The cladding model presented is suitable for inclusion in existing multistory building models and is currently being used to study cladding-structure interaction in high-rise buildings.

The model describes: (1)Diffusion of oxygen, chloride ions, and pore water through the concrete cover of reinforcement; (2)ferrous hydroxide near steel surface; (3)the depassivation of steel due to critical chloride ion concentration; (4)the cathodic and anodic electric potentials depending on oxygen and ferrous hydroxide concentrations according to Nernst equation; (5)the polarization of electrodes due to changes in concentration of oxygen and ferrous hydroxide; (6)the flow of electric current through the electrolyte in pores of concrete; (7)the mass sinks or sources of oxygen, ferrous hydroxide, and hydrated red rust electrodes, based on Faraday law; and (8)the rust production rate, based on reaction kinetics. To enable calculations, numerical values of all coefficients are indicated. The theory is completed by formulating the problem as an initial-boundary value problem.

AB - The theoretical physical model developed in a companion paper, is applied to a simplified calculation of corrosion rates and times to corrosion cracking of concrete cover. Setting up approximate estimates of effective resistance of the corrosion cell, and treating oxygen and chloride ion transport through concrete cover as quisi-stationary and one-dimensional, the corrosion problem is reduced to ordinary differential equations in time. For determining the extents of cathodic and anodic areas and the thickness of the rusting layer, a new principle stating that the actual corrosion current is maximum is postulated. Various steady-state corrosion processes are then analyzed, and after developing approximate formulas for the time of steel depassivation due to chloride ions and for cover cracking due to volume expansion of rust, a number of illustrative numerical examples are given. Diffusivities for chloride ions and oxygen are shown to be usually the controlling factors.

AB - An ultimate load theory for curved glued laminated beams in bending is developed which is based on a simplified model of timber behavior. The bending strength of curved laminated beams compared with that of straight beams of identical cross section is shown to be dependent on the type of loading, the ratio of lamination thickness to radius of curvature, stress relaxation, the number of laminations and the ratio of maximum tensile stress to maximum compressive stress in the timber. Stress relaxation tests are reported and the data used to determine one of the parameters required by the theory. It is shown that the predicted strength results are in satisfactory agreement with test data obtained from the work of previous investigators. After a consideration of current recommendations for the design of curved laminated timber beams new proposals are made which should lead to more satisfactory designs.

AB - Light-weight sandwich panel assemblies can be prefabricated, mass-produced, easily transported, and effectively erected with a small crew and no crane. A one-half scale, six-story building model made up of 2-in. (51-mm) thick aluminum sandwich panels and stapled connections resisted lateral loads of up to 83.3 psf (4,000 kN/m2) representing reference wind speeds of over 93 mph (150 km/hr). An analytical approach has been developed to predict deflections and stresses of panelized building structures having friction-variable shear connections that give rise to nonlinear behavior of the structure. Theoretical and experimental results compared within an average of 6% and a maximum of 13%.

AB - The writers indicate a direction for the improvement of the wind design of structures. The direction involves the extension of previous wind speed mapping procedures to incorporate local meteorological conditions in the development of a wind speed map for a local geographic region. A case study indicates several important elements which must be incorporated in a wind microzonation study. Structural engineering examples demonstrate the importance of microzonation in the establishment of design wind loads.

AB - Sustainability of protective structures to dynamic impact is investigated using computer finite element modeling. Two panels are modeled: a 1/4-in. (19-mm) steel missile panel and 18-in. (460-mm) thick reinforced concrete panel. A dynamic force simulating a tornado-tossed 130-mph (210-km/hr), 4,000-lb (1,800-kg) passenger car is imposed on each panel. As a means of validating the concrete panel model, a simulation was performed of a 12-in. (305-mm) steel pipe impact with the concrete panel. Results are compared with actual experimental testing. Based on findings, less reinforcement or concrete, or both, may be safely applicable in the design of auxiliary structures if other design criteria are not compromised.
