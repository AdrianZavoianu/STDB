AB - The experimental results of 46 shear tests of ungrouted and grouted concrete block masonry are reported. The shear specimens were tested under shear along the bed joints. The influence of mortar type, grout strength, bed-joint reinforcement, and the level of compressive stress normal to the bed joints were studied. The results indicate that the mortar joint's strength characteristics do not have a major effect on the resistance of masonry joints to shear-slip failure. The grout strength and the normal compressive stress are the most significant parameters influencing the joint capacity. The relative contribution of grouting towards increasing the joint shear strength decreases as the level of precompression increases. A strong correlation between the shear strength and the normal compressive stress is shown to exist for both ungrouted and grouted masonry under low levels of precompression.

AB - A review of inelastic analysis of a cross section is made. Given the history of deformation, the history of axial force and moment may be obtained. Also, given the history of moment and axial force the history of deformation may be obtained. The tangent stiffness method is modified to avoid convergence difficulties due to large inelastic unloading. Stress-strain curves considered are generally nonlinear but symmetric, exhibiting hysteresis and the Bauschinger effect. The solution is checked against others. The method has been included in a discrete element frame analysis program and used to predict the behavior of a brace member for which experimental results are available.

AB - Sixty-three masonry disks were tested under splitting loads having different orientations from the bed joint direction. The influences of mortar type, grout strength, and bed joint reinforcement were studied. The results show that the tensile strength characteristics of either ungrouted or grouted masonry vary with the stress orientation that indicates the inherent anisotropic nature of masonry as a composite material. The contribution of grouting varies substantially with the stress orientation. It has a maximum contribution under tension stress normal to the bed joint whereas it has a negligible contribution under tension stress parallel to the bed joint. The mortar type had little influence on the tensile strength. The bed joint reinforcement only contributes to the capacity under tension stresses parallel to the bed joint.

AB - Seismic restraints are provided to support safety-related electrical cable trays or conduits and HVAC ductwork in nuclear power plant structures. It is shown that most of these restraints, in the form of frames, can be represented by single-degree-of-freedom models for analysis and design. Approximate formulas, based on the stiffness of the SDOF models, are presented to determine the natural frequencies very quickly and reliably. The formulas have the added advantage of demonstrating the contribution of different members to the frequency of a frame. The use of the formulas, presented in the paper, can considerably simplify the dynamic analysis of seismic supports for electrical cables and HVAC ducts in nuclear power plant and other structures.

AB - In current procedures for the structural analysis of guyed towers the effects of the guys on the tower displacements are estimated by determining the guy force on the tower with the tower fixed (guy preload) and the change in this force as the tower displaces (guy spring constant). With the introduction of very tall towers, of new tower applications offshore, and of synthetic guys, the analysis of the guy as uniformly loaded and linearly elastic becomes inadequate for describing the actual environmental loadings and guy properties. In this paper new formulas are developed for calculating guy cable preloads and spring constants. The formulas are evolved for arbitrarily loaded guys containing any number of discrete masses and having arbitrary constitutive relations. The calculations of guy preloads and spring constants from these formulas are demonstrated by numerical examples.

AB - The behavior and the strength of reinforced concrete beams with shear span to depth ratio = 1.5 is investigated in an experimental program involving eight beams with a constant longitudinal steel ratio. The beams were loaded in the common framing situation where the loads and reactions are applied as shear on the sides of the member. For the shear span to depth ratio and reinforcing particulars employed the test results show that the horizontal web reinforcement has no significant effect on the beam strength and behavior. The aggregrate interlock does not have a large effect on the strength of beams with vertical web reinforcement. The vertical web reinforcement decreases the beam deflections and crack movement. After cracking, the simple beam theory is not valid for predicting the strain distribution in the zone where the beam is subjected to bending moments and shearing forces, while it is valid in the zones of pure moment. The measured strain distribution shows a tendency towards the arch action behavior.

AB - Extensive experiments were carried out on ferrocement beams reinforced with various amounts (volume fraction from 2% to 6%) and types of square steel meshes. The beams were subjected to fatigue flexure with three levels of loading corresponding to approx −40%, −50%, and −60% of static yield load. Particular emphasis was given to the shape of the load-deflection curve and the cracking behavior as influenced by the number of loading cycles. Based on observed results linear regression equations are proposed to predict fatigue life of ferrocement as a function of the stress range in the outermost layer of steel mesh. Also, an exponential relation with two parameters is developed to predict the increase in deflection, average and maximum crack widths as a function of applied load, and number of loading cycles. The preceding relations are shown to be usefully adaptable to reinforced concrete beams subjected to fatigue flexure.

AB - A general theoretical expression for the load-carrying capacity of timber beams, taking into account lateral instability, and columns, has been developed under the assumption that the conditions are elastic until failure but that the structures have initial curvature and torsion. The general expression is specialized for plane bending (axially loaded columns and combined axial force and moment) and pure bending taking lateral instability into account. Tests carried out in Denmark and Holland for axially loaded columns are referred to, and a series of tests carried out with laterally loaded columns is described. The correspondence between theory and test results is very satisfactory when the measured material values, etc. are used for each test specimen. In a number of graphs it is shown how the load-carrying capacity for columns (axially and centrally loaded) and for beams without axial force is dependent on the various parameters. It is shown to be possible to disregard the influence of certain factors, among others the initial torsion.

The development is based on a simple deformation mode observed in tests. Application of the method to two welded diaphragms and six screw-connected diaphragms shows that the calculated strengths and flexibilities compare favorably with the experimental data and finite element analyses.

AB - The stability of cross bracing in which two diagonal members are used to resist a shear type load are studied, one member being in tension and one in compression. The results of a series of tests demonstrate that the present design method that neglects the effect of the compression member is conservative. An analytical approach is presented for predicting the maximum cross-bracing load. The tension member acts to brace the compression member with the result that the latter carries a significant portion of the total load. The maximum load may be assumed as that resisted by the two members when the compression member reaches its critical load.

AB - Examples observed in a group of about 4,000 steel, concrete and timber bridges illustrate maintenance problems caused by unsatisfactory details or by incorrect evaluation of the environment. Corrective measures and improved detailing and construction practices are suggested. Cracking in steel members occurred where high secondary stresses resulted from unequal loading of members connected in parallel, at stress raisers, and as a result of antiplane shear or of localized bending in a plane normal to the element plane at locations where deformation was concentrated by variations in stiffness of the load path. In most cases, fatigue was involved. Deterioration of all materials was caused by details that trap water, retard evaporation, or allow replacement of evaporated moisture. Extensive general deterioration of steel occurred in a chemically aggressive environment with only a light accumulation of rust and little pitting. Some details that caused maintenance problems obviously facilitated erection or were used to avoid conditions prohibited by design specifications.

AB - Parallel Laminated Veneer (PLV) products are manufactured by adhesive bonding of rotary-peeled veneer. It has been estimated that a production line PLV process could convert green logs into a finished structural laminate in less than an hour. Press-Lam, a PLV product under investigation at the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory, has exhibited decreases in variability of mechanical properties and increases in chemical preservative penetration and retention when compared to solid-sawn lumber. A prototype highway bridge entirely of Press-Lam has been erected by the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation. This bridge was field-tested to its AASHTO HS-20 design load. Preliminary allowable stresses were determined by data obtained from destructive laboratory tests on 18 full-scale stringers and 10 sections of decking made from Douglas-fir Press-Lam. In the face of dwindling supplies of large structural timbers, PLV products are attractive alternatives for exposed structural applications.

The yield line theory of structural analysis for determination of the ultimate load-carrying capacity of reinforced concrete slabs was extended to include high temperature effects. Large displacements, membrane action, temperature-dependent mechanical properties, and thermally induced strains were taken into account. A FORTRAN computer program based on the analysis was written and validated. A short parametric study was conducted with the developed analytical method to determine the influence of slab aspect ratio and of two temperature profile parameters on the ultimate load capacity.

AB - Composite slabs consisting of cold-formed light-gage steel sheets and normal or lightweight concrete have been used extensively under static loading conditions but are generally not used under heavy moving loads. Preliminary tests indicated a favorable response when these composite slabs were subjected to repreated loadings. Additional fatigue information is presented for composite slabs using steel sheets with different embossments, and 12-in., 18-in., and 24-in (305-mm, 460-mm and 610-mm) shear spans. A total of 19 slabs (seven static and 12 repeated loading) were tested. Despite the fact that first slip had occurred when the repeated loading was applied, only four of 12 specimens subjected to repeated loading failed in less than 2,000,000 cycles. Three of four failures were due to a fatigue failure of the steel sheet. The response of composite slabs when subjected to repeated loading was good. Special attention has to be paid to cases in which the tensile stresses in the steel sheets are relatively high as this may lead to a fatigue failure of the steel sheet.

AB - A simple procedure is proposed to evaluate the out-of-plane vibration frequencies for a class of horizontally curved beams. The two governing differential equations are first partly uncoupled by means of a linear transformation. When the remaining coupling terms cannot be neglected, a two-degree-of-freedom solution is obtained by taking advantage of the similarity between the two uncoupled mode shapes. The method yields an exact solution only for simply suported curved beams. For other support conditions the solution is approximate. The method is illustrated by a numerical example: a fixed-fixed curved highway with open cross-section.

The test program consisted of two micro-concrete continuous folded plate models. The models were single unit trapezoidal section continuous over two spans of 2.625 m each. The experiment was conducted in two stages: (1)Simply supported models were first tested without any interior diaphragm (span 5.25 m) up to the loads less than the elastic load; and (2)then an interior diaphragm was cast and tested to failure.

AB - At first glance the notion of using prestressed concrete in tension members is something of an enigma. Yet prestressed concrete can be used to take advantage of the strength of high tensile steel and produce members having any desired stiffness. Examples of applications are considered. The experimental investigation examined the load-elongation and cracking behavior of prestressed concrete members loaded in direct tension. The influence of prestress level and the effect of different amounts of bonded and unbonded wires were examined. Different combinations of high tensile and mild steel wires were used with some of the high tensile steel being either tensioned or untensioned.

AB - An analysis of the behavior of glue-laminated wood beams under impact load in the elastic and plastic range is presented. The theoretical part of the study consists of the definition of the general methodology of solving the vibration of the system with a nonlinear ratio between force and deformations. The validity of the vibration design is verified by a testing program using full-size specimens. The test results obtained agree favorably with the theoretical predictions. There is good coincidence in the elastic range between the actual and theoretical dynamic characteristics. There is a discrepancy between measured deformations under static and dynamic load in the plastic range. The theoretical dynamic characteristies with and without damping coincide well with the corresponding real dynamic characteristics and the theoretical method given may be used in the plastic range.

In this method, harmonic functions that satisfy the boundary condition in the longitudinal direction are used in conjunction with exponential functions for the transverse direction. Stiffness matrices for both bending and in-plane actions have been developed for a plate with an orthotropic elastic property, and by dividing the folded plate structure into a number of plate elements bounded geometrically by lines of fold. Any combination of loadings may be considered. After obtaining the joint displacements, the stresses and displacements at any point of the structure are readily calculated. A special digital computer program is developed for the analysis.

AB - An analysis of a structure consisting of a set of parallel columns linked by lines of braces placed to resist column buckling is presented. A succinct nondimensional expression is generated from which an upper limit to the axial load in the braces can readily be calculated or which can be used to produce design charts. A sample chart is included. The number of columns, the number of braces, their relative elastic stiffness, and the level of column compression are all adjustable. The columns are assumed to be deformed before loading and the deformation parameters are also adjustable.

AB - This note reports the results of an investigation of the minimum-weight plastic design of a propped cantilever beam of nonuniform cross section. The design of a propped cantilever occurs in the plastic design of the end span of a continuous beam; therefore the results reported have wide application. The types of cross section that fall within the scope of this note are rolled sections with flange or cover plates, plate girders, and tapered girders.
