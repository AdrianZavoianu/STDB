AB - Three hyperboloidal shell models made of epoxy resin (araldite) having nearly perfect geometry and constant wall thickness were tested first without stiffeners, afterwards with five, nine and 19 rings and 19 rings plus 36 meridional ribs. The axisymmetric loading resulting in various combinations of membrane stresses in ring and meridional directions was increased in steps until the first buckling wave could be observed. The initiation of the buckling process and the shifting of the region where the first buckling wave was observed were studied. The experimental results are compared with calculated values using a classical linear buckling theory. The experimental values fitted a nondimensional empirical law in terms of the uniaxial buckling stresses for each type of stiffening. An approach, based on the theoretical results and the tests carried out, is proposed to describe the buckling behavior of hyperbolic shells of revolution with and without stiffeners.

AB - Twenty-five full-scale tests were conducted to determine the strength of moment connections for three-plate interior columns in which one column flange contained a midthickness lamination-type discontinuity. For the range of variables tested the connection developed the yield strength of the beam tension flange, but not necessarily the plastic moment of the beam, if the lamination width was smaller than about 2 in. (51 mm) for A36 steel, and smaller than about 1-¼-in. (32 mm) for A588 and A572 Grade 50 steels. Larger laminations caused connection strength reduction as described by a finite-element model of elastic-plastic fracture.

AB - Intermediate transverse bracings may be neglected in the space frame calculations when computing the stresses in the main girders and the values of the reactions, as they have a negligible effect on the load distribution. Thus it is sufficient to consider only the two-end transverse bracings which will facilitate the space frame calculations. Twelve simply supported skewed bridges of the same span with various angles of skew and various numbers of intermediate transverse bracings have been analyzed as ordinary single planar structures and as space structures. The values of the bending moments and reactions are presented in tables as a function of the angle skew and the number of intermediate transverse bracings. The forces in the end, intermediate and wind bracings due to the vertical loading of the bridges were calculated and are presented as a function of the angle of skew.

AB - The first three natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes for fixed-base coupled shear walls are presented. The wall is modeled as a continuum of uniform properties and the resulting sixth-order homogeneous differential equation in terms of lateral displacement is solved exactly using appropriate numerical methods. The results are presented for various combinations of the two nondimensional parameters which between them incorporate all the geometric and material properties of the wall system. The mode shapes are presented in terms of the first three normal modes of a uniform slender cantilever. The nondimensional base shears appropriate for the response spectrum analysis of the walls under seismic loading are also given for the three modes and for the various combinations of the wall parameters referred to earlier. The results show that the coupled wall mode shapes cannot be adequately approximated by the corresponding shapes for a slender cantilever.

AB - A mathematical procedure is described by which the structural response of reinforced concrete slabs in fire environments can be predicted. The procedure has been implemented in a computer program, FIRES-SL. An iterative approach is used within time steps to find a deformed shape at which external loads and internal stresses are in equilibrium. The solution method can be used for any specified slab shape, boundary conditions, and placement of reinforcement. Stresses in the direction normal to the slab surface are not considered. A state of biaxial plane stress for concrete and uniaxial stress for steel has been assumed in deriving the material behavior models. These models account for dimensional changes caused by temperature differentials, changes in the mechanical properties of materials with changes in temperature, increased rates of shrinkage and creep with an increase in temperature, and degradation of elements through cracking in different orientations, crushing, and yielding.

AB - Described herein are tests of thirteen conical concrete shells under monotonically increasing axial load conditions. The load-deformation response, internal stresses and crack propagation through the elastic, inelastic and ultimate stress ranges are presented. The properties of concrete and the behavior of the shells are varied by (1)Polymer impregnation; (2)steel reinforcement as ring stiffening and (3)general wire-mesh reinforcement. The stress-strain behavior of concrete for both reinforced and unreinforced specimens is tailored to range from strong linear elastic but brittle to tough and ductile by the combination of rubbery and brittle polymers like butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate, respectively. The load carrying capacties for polymer-impregnated concrete specimens are found approximately 2 to 3 times that of plain concrete control specimens. Ductility for MMA/BA shell specimens is found approximately twice that of MMA specimens and 2 to 4 times that of plain concrete control specimens.

AB - The torsional response of box stiffened I-sections has been predicted by two analytical procedures. These methods utilize basic torsion theory and compatibility relationships. One method (approximate) is only applicable for L/a≤1.0 The other method (exact) is valid for all ranges of L/a. The analytical results for a cantilever stiffened beam are compared to experiments test giving excellent correlation. The results indicate that one stiffener can reduce rotations by 44% and two stiffeners by 55%. The induced warping stress is reduced by 20% and 30% for one and two stiffeners, respectively. A study of a fixed-fixed beam in uniform torsion with one stiffener, has shown that rotations are reduced by 50% and warping stress by 25%. The pinned-pinned beam response to uniform load and one stiffener gave a reduction of 25% in rotation and 50% in warping.

AB - Strength and serviceability of timber bridges have been greatly improved by the use of glulam stringers and deck panels as the basic components. Pault and the writer studied composite action in glulam bridges and found that the use of mechanical fasteners and the presence of gaps between deck panels render the composite action incomplete. Interconnection of adjacent deck panels is achieved by tight-fitting steel dowels. This note investigates the feasibility of increasing the recommended dowel hole size and the effect of such action on overall performance.
