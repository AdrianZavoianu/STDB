AB - A method for determining the fatigue strength of fillet welded cruciform joints is presented. The inadequacy of the present fatigue specification is examined through comparison with experimental data. The significance of the lack of penetration occurring at the weld root upon experimental fatigue is presented. A fracture mechanics model of the fatigue behavior is developed and correlated with experimental results. Design equations based on the model and a design example are presented.

AB - The results of ultimate-load tests on two continuous-span composite slab-girder bridge models are presented. One of the models was a three-girder two-span structure and the other was a three-girder three-span structure. Both models were tested to failure with a single concentrated load applied over the center girder. The purpose of the tests was to determine the variations in both the distribution of moment throughout the structures and the effective widths of slab acting with each girder as the load is increased to failure. The experimental results are compared with an existing analytical procedure and a major conclusion is that the analytical procedure may be used to conservatively model actual bridge structures up to failure loads. In addition, it is concluded that effective widths and distribution factors at failure loads are significantly different from values obtained at service loads. The implications of the latter observations in bridge design are discussed.

AB - In order to carry out inelastic dynamic analyses of steel offshore platforms under earthquake excitations, flexural members are generally modeled by assuming the formation of plastic hinges at the ends when the corresponding moments exceed a limiting value. In this work, static solutions are obtained for the yield and post-yield properties of tubular members in flexure by making use of experimental moment-curvature relationships that are available in nondimensional form for several levels of axial load acting on the section. The objective is to determine improved properties for the point hinges by considering the spread of yielding. These properties are the equivalent yield moment at zero axial load, the post-yield stiffness expressed as a fraction of the corresponding elastic stiffness, and an interaction diagram giving the yield moment as a function of the axial load. The sensitivity of response to variations in these properties is also examined by analyzing an example platform.

AB - French fire safety rules allow the theoretical proof of fire stability of structures. The CTICM established a method which includes two parts: critical temperature calculation; and heating calculation. The first part, based on plastic design, is the subject of this paper. Comparisons are given between experimental critical temperature and calculated temperature, for statically determined and undetermined beams with variable condition of heating. The problem of restrained expansion of columns is also considered.

AB - The derivation of an expression for the St. Venant torsional stiffness of a beam of variable torsional rigidity is given, and this is applied to the evaluation of this stiffness for tapering solid and thin hollow rectangular beams, the results being compared against convergent solutions. The effect of angle of taper on the accuracy of the method is assessed by comparing the exact solution of a tapering beam of solid circular section against a solution using a method similar to that proposed for rectangular sections. The inclusion of warping restraint is then affected. A general derivation of the stiffness of a prismatic beam is given, and applied to beams with rectangular solid and thin hollow sections. A method is then given for the evaluation of the stiffness of a tapering beam of solid rectangular section restrained from warping, and finally the expressions for the stresses induced due to torsion are presented.

AB - The stability of single-crossarm stayed columns with three crossarms is investigated. Research to date has dealt only with stayed columns with four crossarms arranged in a cruciform manner. The objects of the research are: (1)To illustrate an analytical method of predicting the buckling load and corresponding mode of buckling; (2)to investigate the effects of varying certain of the stayed column parameters; and (3)to compare the efficiency (buckling load to weight ratio) of a single-crossarm stayed column with three and then with four crossarm members. Numerical examples are presented. It is shown that it is possible to predict the buckling load and the corresponding buckled shape for any space stayed column. It is concluded that the buckling load of the stayed column with four crossarm members is always higher than that for the corresponding stayed column with three crossarm members, but that the maximum efficiency of stayed columns with three crossarms is higher than that for four crossarm members regardless of stay diameter.

AB - A lumped mass model of a railway bridge is developed where only the vertical degree-of-freedom for each joint is considered. The vehicle system is idealized as a three degree-of-freedom model of a railway vehicle consisting of the carbody and wheel-axle sets. Dynamic interaction equations for the bridge-vehicle system are derived and solved using the numerical integration method. Impact factors for member forces and nodal deflections are generated under the action of a single or a series of three moving vehicles. Impact factors are compared with AREA specifications for truss and girder bridges.
