AB - A revised version is presented of a procedure for calculating the along-wind response of tall buildings previously developed by the writer. This version: (1)Incorporates recent improvements in the modeling of mean wind profiles and of turbulence intensity; (2)includes a correction in the Monte Carlo integration algorithm employed to obtain the rms values of the fluctuating response and thus results in more accurate values of the calculated along-wind response; and (3)is simpler to use. A numerical example is given illustrating the use of the procedure.

AB - Methods are examined for using basic climatological data for predicting rational structural loadings in areas of heavy snowfall where standards must be established by local personnel. Parameter characterization of snow loading using a statistical analysis of extreme annual events is discussed and procedures are described to allow an expansion of the multi-point data into a continuous or subregional type of spatial representation. Recently introduced United States state snow load codes are reviewed and a data normalization procedure is demonstrated for one entire state area. Methods are reviewed for the correlation of ground and roof snow loadings for various types of structures for conditions involving localized effects from wind, terrain, etc. Special design considerations such as roof material selection, ice damming, snow cornicing, ponding and maintenance are described and current thinking is discussed.

AB - This paper briefly describes the development of a finite layer element program for computing stresses and displacements resulting from nonlinear temperature gradients in continuous skew slab-girder bridges and deals with the experimental investigation of a two-span continuous skew bridge model with an intermediate stiffening beam. The temperature distribution through the depth of model, which constitutes the input of the finite element program, is obtained by solving the one-dimensional transient heat-flow equation. The experimental values of thermal stresses and deflections of bridge model are presented and compared with those obtained by the finite element program. An example of practical application of the program is also presented to illustrate the order of magnitude of thermal stresses expected in the two-span continuous skew bridge due to diurnal temperature variations.

AB - The creep buckling of thin nonshallow spherical shells is treated, the material of which is assumed to be isotropic and linearly viscoelastic with special temperature dependence of its mechanical properties so as to fit the thermorheologically simple body model. The shell is subjected to uniform external pressure smaller than the classical buckling pressure for corresponding elastic shells. The prebuckling stress state is assumed to be the membrane state, and total deflections are less than or equal to the shell thickness. The classical stability criteria, uniqueness of equilibrium, is used in formulating the problem, defined by a linear integrodifferential equation in terms of displacement field W, and describing the adjacent equilibrium configuration, and it is assumed to be a function of coordinates and time. A first-step approximation to the governing equation is derived and used to determine the external critical pressure loading as a function of temperature, time, and shell geometry. For a shell made of a three-element model material a safe load limit is established.

AB - A method is developed for obtaining probabilistic soil-dependent pseudo-absolute acceleration response spectra. The resulting spectra are consistent with the acceptable design risk level from future earthquakes at a specific site. Structural exposure to future earthquakes is obtained in terms of probabilities of peak ground acceleration values that can occur at firm grounds, intermediate soils, and soft soil sites. These are combined with gamma-distributed response spectral shapes (or dynamic amplification factors) and for firm grounds, intermediate soils, and soft soils. Strong earthquake ground-motion data from past seismic events are used as basis for the development of the response spectral shapes. The convolution of the probability distribution of peak ground acceleration with the corresponding probability distributions on response spectral shapes yield the probability distribution of pseudo-absolute acceleration response spectra as functions of structural period and damping. From them, response spectra for 10%, 20%, and 50% risk levels are developed at sites with firm, intermediate, and soft ground conditions.

AB - An experimental program combined with on-site inspections have been conducted to investigate the structural integrity of using metal bands to repair longitudinal splits in timber structures. The experimental program of testing five full-scale trusses and repairing with bands showed that banding is a questionable technique for many applications. Several disadvantages of utilizing banding repairs for timber structures were found: (1) There are inherent difficulties in determining which damaged areas are amenable to banding repairs; (2)the possibility of ineffective repairs is great with the current state of knowledge; (3) there is a lack of standard procedures to insure the proper number, placement, and prestressing of bands; and (4) moisture variations may cause significant shrinkage and swelling of wood leading to loose and ineffective bands. It is therefore recommended that banding not be used as a repair technique for timber structures.

AB - The damping of a steel braced frame with a vertical layer of visco-elastic material is quantified by computing steady-state responses to harmonic lateral loadings. Viscoelastic constitutive equations are used to model all materials. It is found that the constrained viscoelastic layer significantly increases the damping of the frame while causing a tolerable loss in lateral stiffness. The static behavior of the frame is found to be analogous to that of coupled shear walls. It is observed that weighing each material's damping contribution by its strain energy and summing contributions to obtain the total damping, significantly overestimates the true damping of the composite frame. In general, it is determined that such a method is inappropriate for series systems in which some materials are highly damped while others are only slightly damped. Issues other than damping which relate to the feasibility of the concept are briefly considered.

Design procedures, based on elastic plate theory and finite element analysis, are used in conjunction with a reduced elastic modulus to predict long-term deflections. Construction of the platforms is carried out using semi-automated techniques and the provision of support facilities such as airstrips is a major part of the program. Methods of monitoring vertical deflections and strains through the ice are described. The trends over the past 5 yrs and for the near future are to heavier rig loads and longer durations.

AB - A geophysical model of ground-motion simulation is used to generate the statistics of the power spectral density (PSD) of the acceleration at the bedrock level of a site. A nonstationary Poisson model of occurrences is then developed to combine the effects of all the probable sources in the seismic zone of interest. The consistent probability PSD is computed as a basic design parameter. Consistent probability peak response spectra, rms response spectra, and pseudotime histories are also derived as design parameters. A numerical example is given for a site in southern California to demonstrate the applicability of the method.

AB - Nominally identical 25 rolled beams for each group of three different lengths are tested carefully under a concentrated load applied vertically at the midspan of the compressive flange of span center. The variation of the geometrical and material imperfections are measured and the influences of the various parameters on the scattered test points of the lateral buckling are reviewed. The main parameter which highly influences the variation of the ultimate strength is the variable value of actual plastic moment. The obtained test results are also compared with the existing test data and design formulas. The coefficients of variation of the strength increase with beam length and these values are considerably low as compared with the past scattered data. Finally, a design formula is proposed to ensure empirically the lower bound for the scattered test values.

AB - Section models of several long H-section members of the Commodore Barry Bridge were tested in wind tunnels for aerodynamic coefficients and for vibration response when supported in a three degree-of-freedom mounting. Vibration testing was carried out in both smooth and turbulent flow. Comparisons were made with the response of an aeroelastic model tested at the Vertol Division of the Boeing Company. Tests results clearly show that for long H-section members, significant distress may occur due to static (mean) and fluctuating forces produced by wind effects. Vorttex excitation and self-excited motion are possible unless frequencies are relatively high and greater damping than the usual structural level is provided. Some remedies are considered; the actual solution adopted as worked out by others is noted.

AB - In the stiffness method of analysis, as applied to plane and space frames, axial strains in members may be systematically omitted using constraint conditions that prohibit length changes. With these conditions it is possible to solve for some of the unknown joint translations in terms of others. The number of dependent joint translations is equal to the rank of the coefficient matrix for the constraint equations. When these equations are combined with joint equilibrium equations, the number of the latter is reduced by eliminating the dependent joint translations and retaining the independent joint translations and rotations. A further reduction in the number of equilibrium equations is also accomplished by eliminating the joint rotations and keeping only the remaining joint translations as unknowns in the solution. The procedure developed pertains to both two- and three- dimensional frames and is suitable for automation on a digital computer.

AB - A structural analysis for torsional buckling of four-angle cruciform sections is utilized to predict the failure mode of the space truss for the Hartford Coliseum and the results are compared with the observed field conditions after the collapse. The correlation between the analysis and the conditions at the site, including deflections during construction, snow load and the physical arrangement of the collapse indicates a high degree of probability that torsional buckling was the primary cause. Photographs of an overall view and of each corner of the roof as well as diagrams and a load deflection plot are included to demonstrate the descriptions in the text. The use of cruciform sections in compression should be avoided unless satisfactory test data is available for the section to be used.

The method is based on evaluating moments of area of high order, which have been integrated in a closed and optimized form and presented as a generating formula which is applied according to the desired stress functions. Current approximate techniques are reviewed, and applications of the proposed method are examined. Two numerical examples involving reinforced concrete columns are solved to demonstrate the simplicity of this procedure.

AB - One shell was of nailed construction while the other was glued or nail-glued with the gluing pressure being provided by permanently nailing the layers together. The shell membrane was constructed of three layers of model boards or strips giving a total thickness of ½ in. (12.5 mm) with the outer boards running transversely and boards in the central layer running longitudinally. The shells were tested under a radial load applied by means of an airbag. The nailed shell failed at a load of 75 psf (3.6 kN/m2) whereas the nail-glued (glued) shell sustained a load of 160 psf (7.5 kN/m2) before the membrane separated from the edge beam and diaphragm at one corner. The deflections of both shells under load cycling were about twice those predicted by an analysis based on the Schorer approximation, while no analysis was made for the nailed shell under initial load. This error in the calculated deflections was most likely due to the shear deformations in the shell membrane which were ignored in the analysis.

AB - The Newton-Raphson iterative technique is used to model the strength and behavior of axially loaded, fabricated, tubular, steel columns. Such columns characteristically have highly variable section properties along their length, due in part to the residual stresses introduced by the longitudinal welding process. The analysis developed is used to derive a new set of column buckling curves for columns having the maximum permissible initial out-of-straightness. The curves derived show the dependence of ultimate column load on circumferential location of longitudinal welds. It is also shown that the analysis may be used to accurately model the strength and behavior of real fabricated tubular columns, as tested, provided that some consideration is given to eccentricity of load application and to any rotation resistance of end conditions.

AB - The methodology consists of the decomposition of the overall building design problem into a series of problems, one for each building subsystem, e.g., foundation, structure, roofing. The solution of these problems is sequenced in a manner which accounts for the physical interaction between each subsystem. Their solution is coordinated by way of a master optimization problem, the function of which is to determine values for the variables which describe how the various subsystems are interfaced. Box's Complex Method is used to solve the master problem. An objective function which accounts for material, labor and equipment inputs is used. Labor and equipment inputs as a function of building configuration are assessed by considering the elemental operations required for the fabrication or construction of each subsystem. Results are presented for a light industrial structure having plan dimensions of 100 ft by 520 ft. They demonstrate the importance of considering both weight and nonweight related costs.

The deflection at any point of such a beam is found by combining the primary deflection (determined as for an unperforated beam) and the deflection due to Vierendeel action at the web opening. In determining the Vierendeel deflections account is taken of both bending and shear deformations of the T-beams above and below the openings, and of the slope incompatibility that develops at the junction of the perforated and unperforated sections when only simple Vierendeel action is considered.

AB - In the design of a beam-to-column moment connection the principal decisions to be made are simple: the thickness of the end plate, number and size of the bolts, and whether the column needs stiffening. However, the justification of the design is difficult. A correct elastic analysis relies on a proper evaluation of prying forces. But prying forces are unpredictable. The validity of plastic design is limited by a possible lack of joint ductility. It is difficult to develop the full plastic moment capacity of the section at the connection. A practical approach to the design is developed in this paper, and the sequence of design steps is described. Reference is made to tests conducted on this form of connection at Monash University which show the complex nature of the behavior of the connection and illustrate some of the possible failure modes.

AB - Four Australia-wide surveys supply data on public opinion of the appearance of bridges. Duplicate surveys carried out in 1971 and 1978 show consistent results for nine Australian bridges. Two 1978 surveys with 12 bridges show that sketches can be used to obtain results similar to those obtained with photographs. Another two 1978 surveys on six bridges indicate that angle of view affects results. Data is presented to show the influence of familiarity with the bridge, and the sex and age of the respondent. Finally, all 18 bridges are ranked in preference order. This ranking provides evidence of public taste for the more important bridge forms.
