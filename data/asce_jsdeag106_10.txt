AB - A Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to obtain estimates of hurricane wind speeds along the Gulf and East Coasts of the United States. The paper describes the sources of data, the probabilistic models for climatological characteristics of hurricanes, and the physical models for the hurricane wind speed field used in the estimations. Estimated values of fastest-mile hurricane wind speeds at 10 m above ground in open terrain at the coastline and at 200 km inland are given for various mean recurrence intervals. The estimated hurricane wind speeds were found to be best fitted by Weibull distributions with tail length parameters γ≥4. Estimates are given of various errors inherent in the estimated values of the hurricane wind speeds. Owing to uncertainties with respect to the applicability of the physical models used in this work to locations north of Cape Hatteras, estimated hurricane wind speeds given for these locations should be viewed with caution.

AB - Extensive floor load data are utilized in a probabilistic design model for building live loads. Results from most major live load surveys are employed to derive representative loading parameters for several common occupancy types. Simulation is used to verify a number of probabilistic models describing the stochastic nature of the live load components. Area dependent sustained and transient load processes comprise the total load. The mode by which the maximum total load (or design load) is reached during the lifetime of a structure is not known with certainty. A probabilistic model is developed that accounts for the relative likelihood of occurrence of each mode, and is used to obtain example design loads corresponding to the mean of the lifetime maximum total load. For most occupancy types considered these loads are in reasonable agreement with present building code values.

AB - A size-strength relationship for the shear strength of Douglas fir beams has been developed using Weibull's statistical theory of strength of materials. The two-parameter statistical model has been found sufficient for experimental data analysis. Arbitrary loading conditions as well as bearing sizes are considered in the present study. Numerical results indicate that the existing shear strength data obtained from the ASTM shear block tests coupled with the present analysis can serve as a simple, yet reliable, design criterion for the practicing engineer. Design procedures are illustrated by numerical examples.

AB - A method of analysis is outlined for free vertical vibrations of suspension bridges. The method employs a digital computer and a finite element approach, and uses a linearized theory which restricts the amplitudes of vibrations to be small. The analysis is designed to determine the natural frequencies, modes of vibration, and energy storage capacities of the different members of the bridge. Both symmetric and antisymmetric modes of vibrations are considered. For the symmetric modes (which include additional vibrational cable tension), it is shown that it is imperative to include the elasticity of the cables if correct solutions are to be obtained. A detailed numerical example, which includes the effect of the extensibility of the cables and the elasticity of the towers, is presented and the results are examined by a comparison between measured and computed natural frequencies and mode shapes of a real bridge; the comparison shows good agreement.

AB - Two or more plates connected along lines parallel to the direction of in-plane load reach a limiting state of stability that depends on the stiffness of the connection. Intermittent and one-sided welds provide a connection with finite stiffness. Under certain circumstances described in the paper the connection flexibility may be estimated by averaging over the length of the assembly. This leads to a solution of the elastic limiting stability of the plates. When the elements in the assembly develop considerable torsional interaction the buckling stress may be analyzed for the system as a whole. Conditions are defined limiting the effectiveness of intermittent connections and it is shown that the connection is practically rigid if it is an all-around weld with size not less than the plate thickness.

AB - This paper considers the errors associated with the reduction of the structural static degrees of freedom before performing a dynamic analysis. It is shown that the standard methods of performing the reduction can lead to significant errors especially for the member loads computed in a forced vibration problem. A modified reduction is developed which is shown to significantly reduce the errors. The standard and modified methods are applied to a cantilever beam, a gabled frame, and a piping system.

AB - Hurricane wind speeds corresponding to various probabilities of occurrence at any given site are currently estimated using Russell.s procedure a detailed description of which may be found. In this procedure, information on hurricane wind speeds is obtained indirectly from: 1) Statistical information on the climatological characteristics of hurricanes; and 2) a physical model of the hurricane wind field, that describes the dependence of hurricane wind speeds at any given point upon these climatiological characteristics.
