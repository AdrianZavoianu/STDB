AB - A method for estimating the maximum radial tension and compression stresses in curved glulam beams of rectangular cross section is presented. The recommended precedure is based on a parametric study of beams representing a broad range of the key geometric variables and subject to pure bending and uniformly distributed loading. A trapezoidal finite element method was utilized to carry out the analysis of the beams. The overestimation of the radial tension stresses resulting from the simplied assumptions made in the current design procedure for the case of uniformly distributed loading is illustrated. The recommended method for estimation of the radial stresses for the practical loading case of uniformly distributed loading, improves the competitive position of this structural system.

AB - Recently developed thermal and structural analysis techniques show considerable promise for alleviating the extensive testing otherwise required for determining fire ratings for structural assemblies in the United States. In this study, temperature distributions computed in reinforced concrete members for several realistic fire exposures are examined and compared to the distributions measured in a standard test. Structural behavior during the different fire exposures is also considered. Analytical predictions of behavior are validated using experimental data.

AB - The results are presented for an experimental and analytical study of steel column base plates subject to axial loads and moments. A total of 16 tests were made in which the variables were the anchor bolt size, the base plate thickness, and the ratio of moment to axial load. The results of these tests were used to review the two methods of design presently used, one based on the behavior at working load, and one based on the failure load. Both generally produced reasonable predictions of the capacity for the range of variables in this study. The investigation has demonstrated the need for limits of applicability for the two design methods.

AB - A research program was conducted to investigate the behavior of buried, midplane laminar discontinuities (laminations) subjected to through thickness tension loads. The study showed that under certain conditions a simple plastic analysis can be used as a tool for calculating a lower limit of the ultimate load of connections containing large buried discontinuities. This assumes that the material is free of abnormal concentrations of nonmetallic inclusions and that the discontinuity is large and continuous compared with the region to which the through thickness loads are applied. For connections containing small buried discontinuities, tearing at lower loads must also be considered. Equations are given that can be used to make a rational approximation of the strength of beam-to-column connections.

AB - A general nonlinear theory is presented for the strength analysis of composite sections subjected to combined uniaxial bending moment and compressive or tensile normal force. Sections are composed of three materials having arbitrary stress-strain curves and cross-sections of any geometrical form symmetrical with respect to the vertical centroidal axis. A typical numerical example consisting of a steel wide-flange section and longitudinal reinforcing bars encased in concrete is studied for various applied normal forces, different percentages of reinforcing bars and two types of concrete stress-strain curves corresponding to ultimate strains of 0.003 and 0.004, respectively. The study is carried out to determine the influence of the following on composite section ultimate bending capacity: reinforcing bars own resistance to bending, concrete tensile strength, concrete displaced by wide-flange section and reinforcing bars, type of concrete stress-strain curve, and wide-flange section residual stresses.

AB - A simplified procedure for computation of the maximum amplitude of vibration of floors under foot traffic is introduced. Two types of dynamic loads are considered: the heel drop load and a modified treading in place load. Dynamic response analysis of a simplified one degree of freedom damped system is used to relate maximum amplitudes of vibration to the static response under peak loads by means of dynamic magnification factors. Response spectra of the latter are introduced. Limit lines for acceptable floor vibrations in various types of buildings are suggested for Israeli dwellings according to a literature survey and local habits. Examples of evaluation of three different reinforced concrete floor types conclude the paper.

AB - This model accounts not only for the rapid increase of creep at high compressive stress (flow) but also for the decrease of creep observed for subsequent load increments after a long period of low sustained compressive stress (adaptation). A simply supported column is analyzed for typical load histories: sustained loading; short-time loading to failure; and sustained load followed by short-time loading to failure. Numerical results confirm that the flow nonlinearity makes the column fail in a finite time and the adaptation nonlinearity makes the response to the short-time load applied after a long period of a low sustained load stiffer. Also, there is a substantial difference in the column strength for the same load duration depending upon the loading history, especially the ratio of constant sustained load (dead load) and short-time load (live load) and their durations. This could be taken into account in setting the safety factors for columns subjected to dead and live loads of various ratios.

The significant displacements and force actions derived in this way compare favourably with more exact analyses of the same structures. Problems associated with the proportioning of hanging and bracing cables are considered and some aspects of the design of a three-way cable grid are given.

AB - In connection with the widespread tendency toward base-column design in the future on the strength not of ideally straight, but of initially crooked columns, it is of considerable importance to clarify the influence of end-restraints on such columns, whose strength, so far, was most investigated from the hinged-hinged end conditions. Numerical studies have shown that initial crookedness and residual stresses can significantly reduce the strength of hinged-end columns. This is reflected most notably in the recent development of multiple column strength curves. The effect of these two factors is not so clearly understood, however, for the more realistic case of columns with partially restrained ends. This paper attempts to identify this important problem which requires fundamental research; it provides the needed background information, defines the basic problem in some detail, and describes the current research effort on this subject by the Structural Stability Research Council.

AB - The elastic-plastic response of simple and continuous span composite girder highway bridges, when subjected to factored live loads, is predicted by finite difference plate technique. Using this technique, the live load distribution factor and effective slab width has been determined at ultimate load. These theoretical results, presented as a series of design equations, are then compared to those obtained from model tests, giving excellent correlations.

AB - Experimental test results are presented of the use of force limiting devices (FLD) on the compressive chords of two-layer space trusses. Two subassemblages and one full-scale truss were tested, and two types of FLD were used. The results are considered in terms of the truss load versus central deflection plots. These highlight the significance of lack of fit of members in causing initial member forces that furnish a reduction in truss load capacity at first yield, after which there may be no significant increased ultimate strength reserve. Conversely, when FLD's were used on the brittle-type compressive chords, improved overall ductility was obtained, and the deleterious effects of lack of fit were moderated owing to favorable force redistribution under ductile yield conditions.

AB - The selection of proper plate sized for box girder bridges, requires extensive trials and experience. Often this experience is not transferred to the engineering community because it is limited in that only several such bridges may have been designed. It is therefore the intention of this paper to present the results of an extensive study, on the optimum design of some of an extensive study, on the optimum design of 81 box girder bridges. These results have permitted the development of a series of equatins for rapid evaluation of plate geometry.
