AB - An investigation is presented into the question of whether or not it may be assumed that the annual extreme wind speeds population at various stations is described by probabilistic models with shorter tails than the Type I distribution. Statistical evidence, based on compararive analysis of annual extreme wind data of and data generated by Monte Carlo simulation, appears to support the validity of this assumption for a large number of stations in the United States.

AB - The behavior of one-sixth scale tubular steel frame specimens employing x-bracing for resisting cyclic loads is studied experimentally. The imposed cyclic displacement applied in a quasi-static manner simulate the effects of intense ground motoins due to an earthquake. An offshore tower designed for wave and earthquake conditions appropriate for southern California served as the prototype for the test frames. The paper reports the hysteretic behavior of the frames and braces under simulated seismic conditions.

AB - An efficient method for the static and dynamic analysis of marine cable structures is presented. These structures may consist of floating platforms, buoys, weights, anchors, ect., interconnected by arbitrary arrangements of cables and flexible pipes. Displacements or forces can be specified at any number of nodal points and wave or current interaction can be simulated. The efficiency of the method has been demonstrated by serveral applications: dynamic response of a deepwater oil production platform, anchor drop, sonar towing, dynamic stiffness of mooring lines, tankers loading systems with flexible pipes, etc. Because the analysis technique is based on simple long curved cable elements, it outperforms all the currently available methods which use series of short straight links to model the cables.

AB - The effects of out-of-roundness errors, that cab be introduced durning the construction of cooling tower shells, on the linear stress distributions are examined. Using a simplified, statically equivalent, simulation of nonaxisymmetric geometric imperfections, it is shown that circumferential bending provides the major contribution to the shell's resistance to the effects arising from these imperfections. It is shown how meridional membrane stresses are also severely affected; this is particularly so if a loss of circumferential moment capacity occurs. The mechanics of behavior in the presence of circumferential imperfections is clarified by a systematic study of the effects of a number of the separate parameters defining the imperfection geometry. As a consequence, suggestions are made as to how the various forms of behavior could be incorporated into future design practice, for the provision of rational tolerance limits for out-of-roundness errors.

AB - Coverage has been given to subjects dealing with the strength and stability of columns, including biaxially loaded members and tubular components. Much information is still lacking about laterally unsupported beams, and detailed research needs are outlined for these as well as for steel building frames. A separate section discuss unresolved problems in the stability analysis of shells and shell-like structures, some of which also are pertinent to large-size tubular structures. The research needs of thin-walled, light-gage construction are discussed in one section. Extensive attention is paid to the stability aspects of plate, box and curved girders. Problems related to dynamic stability phenomena are outlined, as are the needs of composite structures. Brief data is given on needed research regrarding material properties of steels, local buckling phenomena, and the behavior of stiffened plates.

AB - A series solution has been development to analyze the elastic behavior of post-tensioned waffle slab bridges subjected to laterally applied uniform and concentrated (patch) loads. The solution applies to bridges of rectangular and skew planforms. Realistic estimates of the orthotropic rigidities of waffle construction are used in the solution. The analysis is verified and substantiated by tests on two 1/8-scale models of prestressed concrete waffle slab bridges. The load-carring capacity of prestressed waffle-type structures versus prestressed slab-type ones is compared.

AB - Proposed design specifications for steel box girder highway bridges are based on ultimate design approch. For design of unstiffened compression flanges a new strength curve is proposed considering the effects of residual stresses and geometric imperfections. Stiffened bottom compression flanges are designed by an interaction diagram giving the strength as a function of the column slenderness of the longitudinal stiffeners and the plate slenderness of the flange plate. Strength of webs is obtained as a sum of elastic buckling strength and a lower limit of tension field strength. Also given are design rules for other box girder members, fabrication tolerances and erection provisions. Attention is called to desirability of adjustment of load factors to be used with the new design rules.

AB - Tests are reported on 15 semicontinous L-beams with stirrups under concentrated loads creating torsion combined with flexure and shear. The main variables were the amount of stirrups, torque-to-shear ratio, and the ratio of support moment to the span moment. The ultimate capacities of these beams could be predicted by the interaction proposed by Behera and ferguson. However, these tests indicate lower stresses at first diagonal cracking for beams with larger depth-to-width ratios. The postcracking torsional stiffness is only a small fraction of the precracking stiffness. Strain-gage measurements indicate that the stress induced by torsion alone (stress at a point of inflection) varies with torque in a manner similar to the variation of the twist angle. At the maximum moment section, the additional stress due to torque can be conservatively estimated as the stress at a point of inflection.

AB - Optimal designs of arches under multiple load cases using an automated design routine are presented. The design variables consist of geometric (arch shape) as well as member sizing variables (cross-sectional dimensions). The members are sized on the basis of working stress design procedure, and all the relevant provisions of the AISC specifications are met. The optimal arch shapes produced by the present method for a uniformly distributed load case show a good agreement with the theoretical results. The optimal designs under two and three load cases are also obtained. Under two load cases, the optimal shapes are not very different than a parabolic curve passing through the supports and crown of the arch.

AB - Alternative formats for load combination requirements in structural design codes are examined. Basic alternative models of macro load-time dependence for live, snow, wind, and earthquake loads are reviewed and a sensitivity analysis performed to establish a set of models sufficient for combination studies. On the basis of normalized design loads and a spectrum of influence coefficients, load combination factors in the alternative basic code formats are established. Extensive numerical results are presented for possible use in code development, It is concluded that a companion action approach is preferable to a probability reduction factor approach and a set of potential design values is suggested.

AB - Storage bins, silos, stud wall systems with heavy cladding, and other similar structures often consist of siding supported by vertical stiffeners on one side only. In some cases, the weight of the cladding contributes significantly to the axial load on the stiffeners. In other cases, the fill in such structures often exerts lateral forces on the siding which in turn generates friction forces. The side walls will thus carry a significant vertical load which is usually transmitted to the stiffeners as eccentric distributed axial loads. In either case since the vertical forces can be quite large, the question arises as to how these eccentric forces should be accounted for in the design. The cladding or fill, or both, provides lateral support to some degree. However, designers have had little guidance as to when the moments due to eccentric axial loads can be neglected. The purpose of this paper is to provide such guidance.

The beams were subjected to tip shear loads, and results are given to illustrate the influence of the relative size of the openings on the buckling loads which were determined by a modified Southwell Plot. The experimental results have been compared with approximate theoretical values based on an equivalent beam flexural rigidity.

AB - Probabilistic analyses of the safety of structural members frequently have relied on a formulation of the ultimate limit state equation in which load carrying capacity (resistance) is measured by a single variable R, such as the fully plastic moment for a beam. Safety or reliability is defined by the condition where the effects of the applied loads do not exceed resistance R. However, there is a feeling that alternate formulations in terms of the basic variables that determine resistance, yield stress, section modulus, etc., may be more desirable in certain instances. This note compares measures of reliability calculated from the R-variable and basic variables formulations of the safety problem for hot-rolled steel beam-columns subjected to dead and live loads and considers some of the implications for reliability based design.
