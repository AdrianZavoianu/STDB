AB - The purpose of this study is to collect and interpret the results of full-scale wind-pressure measurements that are available for hyperbolic cooling towers and to determine the corresponding displacements and forces in the prototype tower through finite element analysis. In some cases the time intervals for which the pressures were recorded were too long to reflect any dynamic response and static analysis is sufficient. However, in two more recent studies a shorter time interval was used and a dynamic analysis was thought to be appropriate. The main emphasis of this paper was directed towards the elucidation of a time-history analysis method that will have value for the prediction of the structural response of prototype hyperbolic cooling towers due to the measured loadings with a view towards the eventual inclusion of nonlinearities. Also, some dynamic response parameters in the form of amplification and gust factors are calculated using limited ranges of the available time records and some simplifying assumptions necessitated by available resources.

AB - The paper considers wind loadings on cooling towers from both a static and dynamic point of view. Field measurements of wind pressure on full-scale towers provide the main basis for study, and the paper includes a review of how measurements were taken, an interpretation of field data for quasi-static designs, and one suggested procedure for applying field data to a more complete dynamic analysis of the tower response in gusting wind.

AB - A wind-tunnel technique for the assessment of wind induced stresses in cooling tower shells has been developed. It includes simulation of the atmospheric wind and aeroelastic models of the towers under test as part of a complete site model. It is shown that the simulation of the steady and fluctuating wind loadings and the dynamic properties of the models are in good agreement with results from full-scale towers. The predictions of wind speeds for failure of the tower shell given by the method are shown to be in good agreement with full-scale evidence. Stresses in cooling tower shells are sensitive to changes in wind loading distribution arising from aerodynamic interactions in complex groups of towers. If the resonant frequencies of the shell are low enough, vibration arising from turbulence produced by the wakes of buildings and other cooling towers can produce significant contributions to the stresses.

AB - The design of natural-draft cooling towers is dominated by wind action. With respect to the response of the structure the wind load may be divided into a static, a quasistatic, and a resonant part. The effect of surface roughness of the shell and of wind profile on the static load is discussed. The quasistatic load may be described by the variance of the pressure fluctuations and their circumferential and meridional correlations. The high-frequency end of the pressure spectra and of the coherence functions are used for the analysis of the resonant response. In general, the resonant response is small even for very high towers. It increases overlinearly with wind velocity. Equivalent static loads may be defined using appropriate gust-response factors. These loads produce an approximation of the behavior of the structure and in general are sufficiently accurate.

AB - Some of the benefits gained from using closed-loop control in controlling flexible structures are illustrated. It is shown that a closed-loop active control provides the active damping and stiffness needed by any kind of current response of the structure. That leads to the idea of designing a closed-loop control system for a simplified structural model, neglecting those factors which complicate the design. The efficiency of the designed control system is then checked afterwards by considering those factors which have been neglected previously. The design may be revised if the controlled response, considering the neglected factors, is not acceptable. A revision proves to be rarely needed. The procedure outlined in the paper enables one to find easily a closed-loop control for nonlinear or high-order structural systems. An automatic controlled bridge is presented as an example.

AB - A new method for the static analysis of guyed towers has been developed. The tower and guy cables may be loaded by arbitrary distributed or concentrated forces, or both, and there are no a priori assumptions about cable shape (such as the usual catenary assumption). Effect of axial forces as well as shear deformation in the tower are taken into account. The base of the tower may be in any support condition between clamped and hinged including either extreme. Cables are handled by the Method of Imaginary Reactions. For the tower, integration algorithms for the nonlinear beam-column equations are demonstrated by comparison with the exact solution for the classical problem of the Elastica. The technique is then applied to a two-dimensional demonstration problem of a guyed tower. Extension to three dimensions is straightforward and will be reported later.

AB - The method is based on residual forces. Diaphragms are modeled by finite elements of three types: (1)The individual panel units; (2)the supporting steel framing; and (3)the connectors. The connectors are considered to be the sole source of nonlinear behavior, essentially as indicated by experimental evidence. The computer program is user-oriented, and is equipped with an automatic mesh generator as well as an accelerator to improve convergence rate. Applications of the analysis to diaphragms for which full-scale test results are available show good correlation. The method provides full information on displacements and internal force distributions, as well as overall behavior, and thus provides a sound basis for the development of approximate methods suitable for manual design. It may be directly useful for the design of complex systems such as those including large openings or having unusual proportions, or for the design of innovative stressed-skin structures such as folded plates.

AB - Using the principle of potential energy, two fourth order differential equations are developed to describe the flexure of a rectangular three layered laminated beam using the calculus of variations. Natural boundary conditions are given. There is no limitation imposed on thickness of core and face. Formulas for deflections, stresses for cantilever and simply supported beams are derived. The region near a fixed end and the concentration of stresses there is studied. New results for a homogeneous cantilever beam are given. A basis for a Galerkin type solution results from the analysis.

AB - The basic concepts of the proposed Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) method for design of steel structures in sound, logical and appropriate for design of such structures. The purpose of the research described in the eight papers that summarize the research basis of the proposed American Institute of Steel construction (AISC) LRFD design criteria is to provide for the first time a real statistical basis for the rational implementation for this logical design method. This is the sharp contrast to the American Concrete Institute (ACI) approach where strength reduction factors and load factors were selected without a statistical study of variations in actual fabrication and materials properties relative to design values or of variations in design loads. Unfortunately, however, it is very difficult to bridge the gap between the theory of statistics and probability and the real world behavior of actual structures. Because of this, the writer is very concerned as a structural designer that the statistical results which are considered in some of the symposium papers in illustrating the development of load factors do not take into account some very important aspects of uncertainly in dead load and snow load.

AB - This paper reports the results of a study investigating the role of restrained warping stresses in the behavior of a two perpendicular flight, free-standing staircase. This paper verifies that a beam type idealization inaccurately predicts the behavior of the free-standing staircase considered unless that analysis is corrected for restraint of warping at the supports and flight-landing intersections.
