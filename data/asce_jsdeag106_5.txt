AB - Approximations are derived for the section properties required for the calculation of the elastic critical loads of monosymmetric I-beams and are found to be related to the ratio of compression flange and section minor axis second moments of area. Approximations are obtained that are applicable to I-sections with unequal and lipped flanges and that are in close agreement with accurate calculations of the monosymmetry section properties made for a wide range of cross sections. An improved design rule is proposed for the elastic critical stress of a monosymmetric I-beam. A comparison is made of the results obtained using the proposed rule and the present rules of the AS 1250, BS 449, and AISC Specification.

AB - This paper extends previous work in shape optimization for trusses to the case in which a realistic objective function, derived by curve fitting, AISC tables of available members, is used. It is based upon the technique of neglecting the constitutive equations and working only with equilibrium which requires that the member weight be written in terms of the member force. This relationship is achieved by curve fitting.

AB - Probability distributions of wind pressures acting on points or areas of low-rise building models have been measured in turbulent boundary layer flow simulating wind over open country and suburban terrains. Results show extensive positive and negative tails for high negative and positive mean pressure coefficients, respectively. Probability density functions of wind speed have also been found positively shewed at lower heights. It is shown that the Gaussian distribution underestimates the high-pressure peak factors, whereas a Weibull model fits the data adequately. Analytical expressions for the number of upcrossings of any pressure level and the extreme value distribution are presented. Comparison with experimental data shows a good agreement.

AB - The effect of 3-yr weathering on the fatigue behavior of a transverse stiffener detail fabricated from ASTM A588 weathering steel was determined experimentally. The 16 specimens fatigue tested after 3 yr of weathering exhibited, on average, a fatigue life up to 40% shorter than that of 12 nonweathered control specimens. The reduction in life came at the expense of the number of cycles needed to initiate fatigue cracks and was attributed to rust-pitting.

AB - A testing program involving steel beam-to-column web moment connections was recently conducted at Lehigh University. The connections studied had the beam attached to the web side of a wide-flange column by different combinations of bolting and welding with the beam loads tending to bend the column about its weak axis. Four subassemblages each consisting of a W14x246 column and a W27x94 beam on one side of the column only were tested to ultimate under simulated static loading conditions by applying a load to the beam while the column was experiencing an axial load. Presented is a description of the testing program, load versus deflection plots and a description of the failure modes of the four connections. Conclusions are drawn regarding the performance of the assemblages.

AB - Data from 145 recent impact tests of reinforced concrete walls with solid and pipe missiles are used to assess the accuracy of several empirical formulas. For solid missiles, penetration depths greater than six-tenths the missile diameter are predicted by the NDRC formula to within —25%, scabbing is predicted equally well by the NDRC, Bechtel, and Stone and Webster formulas, and perforation is predicted best by the CEA-EDF formula. For pipe missiles, the best overall agreement with data is obtained with the NDRC formulas, using the outside diameter in the penetration equation and the equivalent solid diameter in the equations for scabbing and perforation. The limitations of all of the formulas for impact conditions outside their range of applicability are pointed out. For example, the formulas are inapplicable for highly deformable missiles such as wooden poles and autos and give only approximate results for rotating or irregularly shaped missiles such as fragments from rotating machinery.

AB - A new interaction equation is derived for steel beam-columns that is applicable to the combined lateral plus gravity load condition. Unlike the currently used AISC formula, it does not make use of the effective column length factor, K, and it directly includes the second-order bending stress. Compared with LeMessurier's suggested equation, the proposed formula consistently gives more economical results. The accuracy of the new interaction equation has been thoroughly checked by comparing it with numerous interaction charts.

AB - The local flexural limit design strength of flat slabs around interior columns is analyzed by means of Yield Line Theory. The slabs are assumed to be reinforced orthotropically and to be loaded with a uniformly distributed load. Appropriate expressions are developed for the flexural collapse loads at rectangular and circular columns. Since the resulting expressions are cumbersome, solutions for a large range of practical geometries are plotted on graphs to aid designers and future researchers. Example slabs designed in accordance with ACI 318-77 are analyzed, and it is shown that they are unlikely to fail in the local flexural mode. It is also shown that some relatively small changes in those provisions of ACI 318-77 which deal with permissible bar cut off points and column strip widths could considerably enhance the local flexural strengths of most slabs. It was also found that if the reinforcement had been uniformly distributed in the example slabs as is sometimes done in test specimens and assumed in many analyses, the local flexural collapse mode would have become dominant.

Contribution of concrete to load carrying capacity and the significance of cover spalling are examined. Effects of distribution of longitudinal steel around the column perimeter and the resulting tie configuration, the amount and characteristics of tie steel, tie spacing, and the amount of longitudinal steel affecting the behavior of the confined column core are examined. Concrete cores of columns confined with ties and well distributed longitudinal steel exhibit significant gain in strength and ductility. Tie spacing and the characteristics and the amount of tie steel significantly affect the strength and ductility of confined core. The amount of column steel does not appear to have significant effect on confinement.

AB - This paper seeks to make the contemporary structural engineering profession aware of a 19th century tradition of education which has been almost lost. That educational tradition possessed ideas which do not go out of date and which can stimulate a healthy review of present research and teaching in structural engineering. A good case can be made for the judgment that the two greatest bridge designers of the 20th century were Robert Maillart (1872-1940) using concrete and Othmar Ammann (1879-1965) using steel. It is a remarkable fact that both had the same Swiss educational background and even the same professor for bridge design: Wilhelm Ritter (1847-1906). Because it seems correct to credit Ritter with direct influence, the substance of this present paper is to characterize that influence by briefly sketching first the engineering tradition within which Ritter studied, second his own career as a teacher and researcher in bridge engineering, and finally the ideas central to Ritter's vision of bridge design.

AB - The most natural way of attacking a structural optimization problem is to make use of mathematical programming methods. This approach has gradually evolved into a powerful design scheme that proceeds by linearizing the potentially active constraints with respect to the reciprocal design variables and solving partially the resulting explicit problem before reanalyzing the structure and updating the approximate problem statement. This approach can be viewed as a primal method since the goal is to generate a sequence of feasible designs with decreasing weight. An alternative approach is to recognize that the expliit but approximate problem statement is of such high quality that it can be solved exactly after each structural reanalysis. Adopting this viewpoint leads naturally to consideration of dual methods for solving the explicit problem. This approach can be interpreted as a rigorous generalization of the conventional optimality criteria techniques.

AB - Three popular types of steel beam-to-column connections are modeled as mathematical programming problems which are then solved to produce optimal connection designs for given loading conditions. These are: (1)A framed connection consisting of two angles either bolted or welded to the web of the beam and to the column; (2)a flange plate moment connection; and (3)an end plate moment connection. The set of design variables includes all those necessary to describe completely the design in all possible detail, such as the size of welds, size and number of bolts, and detailed descriptons of angles and plates. Design constraints are drawn directly, without change or simplification, from AISC specifications. The thrust of the paper is a demonstration of the techniques employed for building mathematical models for design. Three examples are included which were modeled as described and the models solved mathematically for the detailed designs.

In the formulation of the design problem the displacements of the joints are treated as design variable in addition to member areas and joint coordinates. For the solution of the nonlinear design problem an approximating program is adopted. The proposed design procedure does not require the structural analysis equations to be solved during the design process. Examples are given to demonstrate the flexibility of the method.

AB - A new continuum model for the lateral load analysis of frame-wall systems with rigidly jointed link beams is presented. It consists of a vertical shear element with infinite flexural rigidity and a restraint-free wall having infinite shearing rigidity. The stiffness of the rotational restraints provided by the link beams to the wall is included in the rigidity of the shear beam. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated with an example of a 15-story system. The present results are in excellent agreement with those obtained by analyzing the structure as a frame, in which the wall is treated as a wide column and the members are taken as inextensible. For the same structure the top deflection found by employing the conventional model was found to be more than three times the correct value, where the conventional model is one in which the link beams are assumed to provide rotational restraints equal to 12 times their flexural stiffness only to the adjacent column.

It is assumed that the ring beams, stiffeners, local thickening of plate and accessories such as ladder, etc. have a negligible effect on the optimum proportions of the container. This reduces the problem to the determination of proportion for which, for a specified capacity, the container has a minimum surface area.

The problem would appear to be solved using standard assumptions of elastic behavior of a transformed section. Such is indeed the case if the concrete is not cracked. However, consideration of a cracked section in conjunction with application of Vierendeel method of analysis leads to which a closed form solution does not appear possible. The purpose of this note is to present the formulation and solution algorithm for this problem.

AB - A realistic assessment of the safety of structures subjected to variable loading requires, in addition to a shakedown analysis, the evolution of certain important quantities at shakedown. Bounding techniques have proved to be convenient and, sometimes, necessary substitutes for the step-by-step historical analysis of structures. Several methods have been proposed to bound deflections under varying assumptions. The present note gives a simple method of evaluating upper bounds to deflections of elastoplastic moment resisting bar structures under quasistatic variable loading. A theoretical example is give to illustrate its application and to compare the bounds obtained through different procedures. A preliminary assessment of the accuracy and thus usefulness of method is also made through assessment of the accuracy and thus usefulness of the method is also made through comparison with some available experimental shakedown data.
