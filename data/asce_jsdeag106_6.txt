AB - The literature on compressive membrane action (dome effect) in restrained slabs is reviewed with emphasis on plastic analysis. The differences between the flow theory and deformation theory approaches are discussed. The example of the rigid-plastic restrained slab strip is used to show that deformation theory may lead to unrealistic predictions.

AB - The influence of elastic deformations on compressive membrane action (dome effect) in restrained slabs is considered. The elastic-plastic circular slab is analyzed, using a flow-theory approach. The inplane and boundary flexibilities are lumped and an initial elastic deflection is assumed. The first part of the predicted load-deflection curve is compared with the results of a test series and reasonable agreement is found, especially with respect to the peak load.

AB - The test program included 14 beams, two of which were of plain concrete, six longitudinally reinforced with corner bars of varying diameters, and six with both longitudinal and transverse steel having varying percentages of stirrups. Dowel action was elaborately isolated from other mechanisms of interface shear transfer, such as aggregate interlock, by using thin smooth brass diaphragms introducing a preformed crack or a simulated whole failure surface leading to a preset torsional mechanism of failure. Variation of angle of twist with the applied torque and the corresponding relative rotation of the two beam segments at the failure crack were recorded up to and beyond ultimate torque capacity. The dowel stress per unit displacement was found to be a variable decreasing nonlinearly with the increase in the relative rotation of the two beam segments. Expressions were derived for this variation and for the prediction of ultimate torque capacity of concrete members with and without web reinforcement incorporting dowel forces.

AB - The results of an experimental study of the fatigue strength of anchor bolts in tension and bending are presented. The influence of bolt diameter, steel strength, thread size, and method of forming the threads is examined. An analysis of the results indicated that these variables did not significantly influence fatigue performance. The fatigue design strength of single nut anchor bolts was found to be adequately represented by the current bridge and building fatigue specification Category E. Tightened double nutted anchor bolts in tension and bending produced fatigue lines comparable to Category C of the fatigue specifications.

AB - The variability of inelastic response spectra is investigated by time-history analysis using sets of artificial ground motions with different strong-motion durations. It is concluded that the Newmark-Hall inelastic response spectra of elasto-plastic systems are unconservative for 5% damping, and conservative for 2% damping. New inelastic response spectra are proposed for different ductility ratios and damping coefficients. A 10-story steel moment-resisting frame is designed and analyzed to assess the validity of the design procedure based upon modal analysis and inelastic response spectra. The results indicate that at least for this or similar frames, the method is satisfactory. However, the procedure leads to slightly unconservative design for upper-story exterior columns. The study also suggests that the maximum lateral story displacement predicted directly by the SRSS modal analysis using the inelastic displacement response spectrum is too conservative. The conservatism is more pronounced in the upper stories.

AB - A mathematical model for the shear transfer across cracks in reinforced concrete is reviewed and used as a guide to identify the main parameters involved in the shear transfer phenomenon. The mathematical model is used as the basis for the statistical analysis of the available experimental data. This statistical analysis provides a simple expression for the prediction of the shear slip along a penetrating crack caused by the transfer of the shear force in the presence of a known normal force and of an initial crack width. This expression is utilized within the context of nonlinear finite element analysis to modify the shear rigidity terms of the constitutive law of concrete upon cracking, on an integration point basis. Verification analyses conducted demonstrate the capability of the proposed finite element model to reproduce experimental results. The proposed approach is applicable to loading conditions that do not cause failure by shear.

AB - Model studies were performed and the finite element method was used to develop preliminary design curves for plain concrete underreams. The factors considered in developing the curves were: the strength of concrete, the geometry of the bell, and the assumed distribution of bearing stress. The curves are designated as preliminary because an empirical correlation had to be made between analysis and experiment; however, in the absence of any previous design procedure the curves should be useful as a guide to the design of underreams.

AB - A numerical method for the analysis of elastic thin-walled box girders is presented. The method is based on the separation of variables suggested by Vlasov and on the finite element method. The method is capable of taking into account longitudinal and transversal flexure, torsion, distortion of the cross section, torsional and distortional warping and shear deformation. Stresses and displacements calculated with the computer program developed for a straight one-box girder have been compared with results obtained by other analytical and numerical methods and with experimental data.

AB - Long buried structures, flexible relative to the surrounding soil, will essentially follow the displacements of the soil. An axial and bending stress of such structures due to different types of seismic waves propagating through the soil has been addressed. Shearing deformations has been studied using a mathematical model simulating the elastic properties of the soil and the ground displacement spectrum. This note is concerned with the shear stresses that would develop in a buried beam due to propagation of shear waves assuming that the surrounding medium is linearly elastic and homogeneous.

AB - A doubly symmetric I-section member of constant flange thickness, web thickness, and flange breadth but with linearly varying depth is a common structural element particularly in steel frames for industrial buildings. It is usual in elastic analysis to assume that conventional Bernoulli-Euler bending theory continues to hold for such members. Even so, it is not possible to obtain a stiffness matrix for major axis bending by exact algebraic integration of the governing differential equation. To overcome this difficulty, power functions have been commonly used to represent, in an approximate manner, the variation of the moment of inertia along the member. Numerical integration or displacement functions can also be employed to obtain the stiffness matrix, although such methods are less convenient to use. A further approximate approach is to treat the member as a series of stepped prismatic segments, but this procedure will result in a large stiffness matrix if more than just a few segments are used.
