AB - Elastic instability of rigid-jointed, unbraced, single-story single-bay, orthogonal space frames subjected to static loads at the column tops is studied. The columns are assumed to be fixed at the base. The influence on the frame behavior of the relative magnitude of the load-multiplication factors for the four columns and the orientation of the principal axes of the column cross-sections is investigated. The instability loads are also compared with those obtained approximately using the effective-length approach. Interesting conclusions are drawn based on the results of 12 numerical examples.

AB - An experimental and analytical investigation of the behavior of structural steel frames with K-braces subjected to severe cyclic loadings simulating seismic effects is described. The hysteretic behavior of a one-half scale three-story test frame is modeled analytically. Good agreement between the experimental and calculated results is shown to be possible provided the cyclic behavior of individual braces is accurately formulated. A development of a refined empirical brace model for this purpose is outlined.

AB - A two span beam with a central elastic support was analyzed for incremental collapse under two loading conditions. In each case a modest support flexibility increased the shakedown load until it equalled the static collapse load. Further reduction of support stiffness then produced a dramatic decrease in the collapse load. Incremental collapse is a more significant factor in the design of structures with elastic supports than it is in the design of conventional structures.

AB - This paper presents a mathematical model for evaluation of differential settlement-induced forces in non-prestressed continuous concrete bridges taking into account the effects of creep, stress relaxation, and time rate of settlement. A force induction factor is derived by which the elastic solution of settlement-induced forces should be multiplied to obtain the viscoelastic solution. A mathematical model is developed for ease of computation and is applied to two numerical examples. The results of these examples, and others not presented for lack of space, show clearly the necessity of including the time rate of settlement of different supports in the computation of settlement-induced forces.

AB - A differential-equation formulation is presented for the small-deflection elastic behavior of thin plates of cross-plied orthotropic bimodulus materials (which have different elastic stiffnesses depending upon the sign of the fiber-direction strains). An exact closed-form solution is presented for a fully clamped, cross-ply elliptic plate subjected to uniform normal pressure. For the special case of isotropic bimodulus material, a simplified approximate solution is also obtained. Good agreement is obtained between the two solutions presented here, as well as with numerical results existing in the literature for a special case.

AB - The behavior of both structural steel and reinforced concrete specimens subjected to quasi-static cyclic loadings simulating severe seismic effects are examined. A large number of experimentally determined hysteretic loops for different structural arrangements based on the work mainly done at the University of California, Berkeley, serve as illustrations. The important distinction among the material, the member and the subassemblage ductilities is emphasized. The significance of the different character of the hysteretic behavior on the overall seismic structural performance is discussed by relating it to the widely-used response spectrum approach for seismic analysis. The relationship of the latter approach to the conventional code design procedures is also given.

AB - Spent nuclear fuel can be disposed of safely in deep geological formations. In fact, technology exists sufficient to provide assurance that permanent high-level waste disposal is feasible. Opponents to nuclear power argue that future nuclear plant operation should be curtailed until a high-level waste disposal facility is in operation. This ignores the fact that more than eighty million gallons of separated high-level wastes already exist from the nuclear weapons program and must be placed in safe, permanent geologic storage. Some groups that are trying to block experiments and demonstrations of geologic disposal seem satisfied that spent fuel could be disposed of in a similar manner. Demonstration of nuclear waste disposal in the near future is essential to public acceptance of nuclear power.

AB - Currently, the overly conservative thermal design forces are obtained on the basis of simplified assumptions made about the temperature gradient across the containment wall. Using the method presented in this paper, a more rational and better estimate of the design forces can be obtained. Herein, the outside temperature is considered to consist of a constant mean on which yearly and daily harmonic changes plus a randomly varying part are superimposed. The random part is modeled as a stationary random process. To obtain the stresses due to random and harmonic temperatures, the complex frequency response function approach has been used. Numerical results obtained for a typical containment show that the higher frequency temperature variations, though of large magnitude, induce relatively small forces in a containment. Therefore, in a containment design, a rational separation of more effective, slowly varying temperatures, such as seasonal cycle from less effective but more frequently occuring daily and hourly changes, is desirable to obtain rational design forces.

AB - The perturbation technique in conjunction with a double Fourier series method are used to yield the postbuckling deflections, bending moments and membrane forces in simply supported orthotropic skew plate structures subjected to oblique in-plane forces. The analysis is based on the solution of the von Karman-type large-deflection plate equations in terms of the force function and the lateral deflection of the plate. All the boundary conditions including those involving the bending moment at the plate edges are satisfied. The convergence of the series solution and its range of applicability are discussed in detail. Numerical results presented for typical cases indicate good convergence of the solution for the range of the deflection considered, as well as provide an insight into the problem of postbuckling behavior of such structures. An example is given to illustrate the use of the data generated in design.

In support of this argument test data is given from an actual load test on a bridge which had experienced some distress in the past, and was not considered safe for carrying normal traffic according to conventional analyses. The sources of distress that were located by the test could be removed by simple remedial measures. By utilizing the enhanced load distribution pattern of the bridge that was also established by the test, the bridge, after minor repairs, was opened to normal traffic.

AB - In a member with a slender, unstiffened web, a combined buckling mode may occur in which the web distorts and reduces the member's torsional resistance, and consequently its resistance to lateral (or flexural-torsional) buckling. In this paper, an approximate analysis of the effect of web distortion on the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of a simply supported I-section member is presented. This analysis leads to a closed form interaction equation, relating the critical uniform moment and axial load acting on the member. The buckling moments and loads determined from this equation are compared with the results of a more sophisticated finite strip analysis, and are shown to be of high accuracy.

AB - A particular opportunity to upgrade the seismic resistance of existing buildings arises when their lifetime is extended by major renovations. There is lacking, however, a set of guidelines that relates the cost of strengthening a structure to the probable reduction in earthquake-induced damage and life loss. This paper offers a recommendation for strengthening buildings undergoing renovations in zones where intensity of expected seismic shaking is low. Two buildings, one a masonry bearing wall and heavy timber floor warehouse and the other a reinforced concrete flat slab factory, are studied to determine the existence of weak links in seismic resistance and the cost of upgrading such resistance during major renovations. The expected damage from three levels of earthquake for the two buildings is summarized in damage probability matrices; these matrices are then used to compute mean damage ratios (MDR). Each MDR is shown as a function of strengthening cost, providing a means for estimating the reduction in seismic risk of these buildings from their present condition when they are either strengthened to a recommended practical level or replaced with new construction.

AB - A method for predicting high cycle fatigue under stationary gaussian wide band stress processes is developed. The rainflow cycle counting method is used as the basis for predicting fatigue damage. Stress simulations from various spectral density models were analyzed using the rainflow method. Statistical analysis of these results provided a closed form expression for fatigue damage. A principal application of the method is to predict fatigue in the welded joints of offshore structures, an example of which is provided. A long term nonstationary sea state is modelled as a sequence of stationary sea states. Thus the example also illustrates how fatigue under certain types of nonstationary stress processes can be analyzed.

Vlassov's governing differential equations for thin shallow shells with variable curvatures in terms of displacements have been employed for the analysis. The integral equation technique is used for the numerical solution of these differential equations. A computer program has been developed for the analysis of the shell. This program gives deflections and stress resultants at various points in the shell under uniformly distributed loads. The present results are compared with Brebbia's experimental data and with other available numerical results. In all these comparisons, a good agreement is achieved.

AB - This paper presents an extension of the penetration theory proposed by the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). The extension is based on experimental studies, performed over the last few years and covering projectiles with lower impact velocities and larger diameters and weights than originally considered by the NDRC. The missiles are considered to be rigid, that means that no deformation of the missile is taken into account. The paper gives a new expression for the calculation of the perforation thickness for the above mentioned range of missiles and a new formulation of the velocity function is proposed, allowing the estimation of residual velocity after perforation. The new formulation preserves the advantages of the NDRC formula and leaves the basic expression unchanged. The impact time and the reaction force are calculated based on the new velocity function. The results are compared with the experiments.

AB - Mathematical models of aquatic systems frequently represent phytoplankton growth dynamics in nutrient limited environments by saturation or Michaelis-Mention type kinetics. When nitrogen is the limiting nutrient and both ammonia and nitrate are present, the representation is complicated by the fact that one form of nitrogen may substitute nutritionally for the other, and the uptake rate of ammonia is significantly faster than that of nitrate. A modified form of nonlinear saturation kinetics, to represent the preference of algae for the ammonia form of nitrogen over, the nitrate form, is proposed and examined.
