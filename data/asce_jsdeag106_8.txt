AB - The tensile strength of concrete is most commonly measured by the indirect split—cylinder test. Recently, an alternative new test, known as double—punch test, has been proposed. It is the purpose of this paper to summarize the present stand on the double—punch test method for the determination of tensile strength of concrete. The summary deals with two equally important aspects of progress—new solutions emerging from the analytical study and experimental results reported from laboratory tests. This paper attempts to evaluate critically this new test method and to determine the range of their applicability, relative merits, and limitations as compared to the well—established split—cylinder tests. Throughout this development and evaluation, it has been recognized that a balance must be struck between the requirement of realistic representation of tensile strength of concrete and the requirement for simplicity in practical use. It is considered that in both these respects, the double—punch method is satisfactory.

AB - Results of tests on very small scale single and double bay stiffened steel panels are presented. These are compared to a series of large scale model tests carried out at the University of Manchester as well as with an analytical method based on the effective width approach. In the case of multiple bay panels the analysis assumes simple support to exist between individual bays, and uses an energy expression to account for the effects of continuity. A set of simultaneous equations are obtained and these are solved iteratively for each increment of applied load. By this means a loading curve up to failure can be obtained. The effect of longitudinal continuity on the failure mode and ultimate load is investigated, and a simplified analysis suitable for design is suggested for taking account of the effects of continuity.

AB - Design procedures for reinforced concrete columns subjected to seismic forces are presented. Four types of column configurations are considered. The four types are: (1)The ductile moment frame column; (2)the captive spandrel column; (3)the flat slab column; and (4)the pilaster column. Pertinent structural analysis methods, design procedures, and reinforcement detailing are discussed. State-of-the-art design by code, needed code improvements, and research needs are mentioned.

AB - A model for the prediction of bending and tensile strength of glued-laminated beams is developed. The model accounts for effect of size, lamination thickness effect, E-rating, and proof-loading of the individual laminations, and it can be used in computer simulations to estimate the distribution of beam strength. Eight types of beams, differing in size as well as in lamination lay-up, were tested. The experimental results are compared with the model's simulations and the agreement is found to be satisfactory.

AB - Idealizations for the cyclic moment-curvature behavior of prestressed, partially prestressed, and reinforced concrete members are presented. These idealizations are used in a comparative study of the earthquake response of partially prestressed concrete single degree of freedom systems, ranging from fully prestressed to reinforced, to different earthquake acceleration records. Maximum displacement ductility factors are tabulated for varying values of system strength, initial period of vibration and viscous damping ratio, and for different earthquake excitations. In general, it is found that for very severe earthquake shaking the displacement response is greater for a prestressed concrete system than for a reinforced concrete system with the same strength, initial stiffness, and equivalent viscous damping.

AB - Seventeen tube specimens and eight angle specimens were tested under repeated axial loading. Length of the specimens varied from 20 in. to 59 in. and their effective slenderness ratio varied from 30 to 140. The objective of this experimental investigation was to quantify the reduction in maximum compressive loads and increase in member length, to study the influence of mode of buckling and shape of cross section on the hysteresis behavior and energy dissipation through hysteretic cycles. It was concluded that local buckling and shape of the cross section can have significant influence on the hysteresis behavior of axially loaded steel members. A hysteresis model is proposed for tubular members which is in reasonable agreement with the observed inelastic behavior.

AB - An approximate method for the analysis of Weakest-Link systems is presented. Using the Normal and Extremal Distributions, a study of the effect of failure mode correlation on systems of two modes was carried out. It was observed that correlation between failure modes contributes significantly to the risk prediction only for high correlation values. By examination of the sensitivity of larger systems to correlation, a hand method of system risk analysis was developed. Example applications to truss and frame structures are presented.
