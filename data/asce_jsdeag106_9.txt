AB - A fundamental objective of offshore platform design is to configure and construct a structure that will have utility, desirable performance, adequate reliability, and reasonable cost. This paper examines reliability considerations involved in development of environmental criteria for offshore platforms. For a given structural criteria, a simple reliability formulation is developed to determine design wave heights or design ground accelerations and their return intervals. Three examples are developed: design wave heights and return intervals for conventional template-type, deep water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and Baltimore Canyon, and design wave heights and effective ground accelerations for similar platforms in the Gulf of Alaska. Return interval is found to be a highly sensitive parameter for specifying design environmental conditions. The use of a range of target Safety Indices is proposed in lieu of return period.

AB - The fatique strength of welded steel beams containing groove-welded flange splices is examined. Nine beams with an as-welded groove weld and nine beams with a flush-ground groove weld were tested. The results for the flush-ground specimens show that these attain the fatigue strength of a plain-welded beam (AASHTO category B). The beams with the groove weld left as-welded gave a slightly lower mean fatigue strength but had lives in excess of those which would be predicted by current specifications (AASHTO category C). Beams with this type of detail could be placed in category B, or a new class, between B and C could conservatively be established to accommodate them.

AB - A set of postmortem force-response type analyses have been conducted and windspeeds quantified for the April 4, 1977, North Birmingham, Ala. tornado. Immediate field damage surveys and documentation were conducted by ground and air. The degree of damage to numerous clean, freestanding structures was thoroughly recorded along the 6½ miles of extensive damage. Upper and lower bound windspreed estimates were obtained based on engineering analyses of the aerodynamic wind forces/damages. Windspeed contours were plotted using these windspeed estimates in conjunction with stereoscopic studies of aerial photographs.

AB - Forced vibration response is investigated for hyperbolic paraboloid cable networks composed of a linkage of straight members connected by frictionless pins with concentrated masses lumped at the connection points. Newmark's β method is used for evaluation of the dynamic response through both a linear and a nonlinear formulation. The linear and nonlinear responses are compared and conclusions drawn regarding the extent to which the nonlinear aspects of the structural response must be considered.

AB - The limit design of a dence regular reinforcing net in concrete panels or walls under in-plane loading is studied with consideration of friction on the cracks due to aggregate interlock. The previously established hyperbolic yield locus, which corresponds to simultaneous yielding of reinforcing bars of both directions, does not give the complete domain of safe reinforcing ratios. The safe domain is larger and the enlargement corresponds to cases when only bars of one direction yield. Those cases are far from the optimum design. Deformations for these cases do not generally conform to the dilatancy ratio that is characteristic of the normal and tangential components on the crack and they do not allow an increase of deformation at constant load.

AB - This paper attempts to demonstrate not only the differences between possible methods of reinforcement of buildings against seismic forces, but also the variations in the desired results. The examples cited used criteria ranging from reasonable protection of life (Case Study No. 1), through total code compliance (Case Study No. 2) to optimum protection of life and property (Case Study No. 3). The issues in the formulation of appropriate building code provisions for the seismic reinforcement of buildings are therefore complex. A recognition and acceptance of the different levels of protection, as far as life, safety, and protection of property, is needed. Code provision dealing with the methods of reinforcement should be based on performance type specification rather than explicit and overly detailed requirements. Research is needed regarding such contributions of structural and nonstructural elements to the seismic resistance of a building that may not meet the letter of current codes.

The formulation is very flexible and versatile, and can deal with various nonuniform sections and different loading conditions. The simple mathematical operations are suitable for both preliminary design and final design with hand calculation or any mini-computer. Numerical example is presented and compared with results obtained by other researchers.

AB - A model is presented to calculate stresses, deformations, and crack width for a concrete slab or a shell wall that carries in-plane forces and is reinforced by a dense regular net of steel bars and containing one or two systems of straight, parallel, equisdistant, and densely distributed cracks. Friction on the cracks (aggregate interlock) and dilatancy due to their slip is approximately taken into account, and slipping cracks without contact are also allowed. The resulting stiffness matrix for concrete with frictional cracks is nonsymmetric and involves cross-terms relating the shear stress (or strain) and the normal strain (or stress), which implies that the principal strains and stresses in concrete are not co-axial. The proposed service stress design with crack slip never predicts smaller values of stresses in steel and concrete and of crack width than the classical frictionless design without crack slip. Significantly larger values are obtained when the angle between steel bars and principal stress is large. A single system of slipping cracks in contact is found to be always the critical case for maximum stresses and crack width.
