AB - Window glass design practice in the 1950s and 1960s was influenced to a large degree by manufacturers glass design charts, adopted by building codes and standards and utilized heavily by the design professions. In the 1970s, a changing design environment caused professionals to examine more closely design processes for window glass. Questions concerning wind loads, glass strength, failure risks, and window system behavior have prompted window glass designers to look beyond the glass charts for guidance. Problems exists because of the limited amount of data and information available on window glass in the open engineering literature. Activity in the field of wind engineering assists the designer with problems related to load definition, but troublesome problems remains, i.e., questions of glass strength, glass behavior under load, and acceptable failure risks.

AB - A computer program for the static and dynamic analysis of plane frames subjected to large inelastic deformations is reviewed. Nonlinear material, soil structure, and geometric effects are simultaneously considered. Problems are solved showing the influence of the stress-strain model on the static and dynamic response of frames subjected to large static load reversals and earthquake motions. Results indicate that while more accurate models are available for structural steel, the relatively simple Masing model is able to simulate the inelastic force-deformation response of frames quite well over a large range of inelastic deformations; even plastic-hinge models may predict accurate frame response.

These joints are designed to withstand differential settlement between independent adjacent structures, and their relative motions during earthquakes, yet still retain the function to minimize joint leakage. Stress deflection, mode of failure information, and leakage information under hydrostatic pressure are presented.

AB - Some shortcomings in the present United States practice for designing membrane reinforcement in concrete shells have been pointed out. Using several existing methods, it is possible to calculate less than the necessary amount of reinforcement, which would lead to an unsafe structure. On the other hand, some of the requirements may be impractical, such as providing reinforcement in principal directions. When there is more than one governing load case, it would be impossible to meet such a requirement. Rational equations for calculating the reinforcement capacity on the basis of the principle of minimum resistance are presented. The state of strain and its magnitude have been examined. Higher tensile strain would lead to larger cracks in the concrete. Recommendations have been made to limit the strain magnitude for the cases in which limiting the crack width is important.

AB - Circular and square tower models were tested in a boundary layer wind tunnel. At close to the critical reduced velocity and particularly at low values of structural damping, displacement dependent lock-in excitation was found to cause large increases in cross-wind displacement response, especially for the circular tower, in a suburban type wind model. Critical cross-wind response amplitudes were determined from the response characteristics. These response amplitudes represent the level of cross-wind response of a structure above which the response can not be accounted for by the random wake excitation process and that lock-in excitation is significant. A prediction procedure, which consists of a random excitation model and a sinusoidal lock-in excitation model, is described. Cross-wind response predicted by these models agreed well with the measured response.

AB - Recent trends in the development of design standards have been toward the use of probabilistic limit states concepts. The development of such criteria requires that a large amount of data be examined by the appropriate standards writing oranizations. This paper describes basic statistical information that currently is available for developing probability-based limit states design criteria for wood structures. A number of problem areas are examined where additional study appears necessary or desirable prior to implementing such criteria in practice.

AB - Statistical buckling experiments of 34 welded beams for each group of two different lengths are carried out under a concentrated load applied vertically at the midspan of the compressive flange of simply-supported beams. The influences of the variations of the various imperfection parameters on scattered test points of the lateral buckling are examined. The obtained test results are compared with the writers' previous test results of the rolled beams. The main imperfection parameter that highly influences the variation of the ultimate strength of the welded beams is the variable value of the actual full plastic moments, as already mentioned for the rolled beams. The welded beams, however, have a lower ultimate strength in the mean value and large coefficient of variation as compared with the rolled beams. The large variations in the compressive residual stresses and the initial lateral crookednesses in the welded beams may cause the large strength variation in the welded beams.

AB - The Ontario equivalent base length concept is reviewed. This concept does not rely so much on the assumption that a vehicle can be described by two variables, the weight, W, and equivalent base length, BM but rather on the observation that the vehicle can be described by a series of points in (W, BM) space. An alternative development is given of an equivalent base called the concentrated base length, b, which is one half the Ontario base length and which introduces a location parameter, x. The validity of the base length concept is demonstrated by developing a vehicle equivalent to a hypothetical family of Australian legal vehicles. The accuracy of resultant curves of design bending moment and shear is assessed. It is concluded that reasonable accuracies can be achieved by the use of a single, nonvariable design truck, and that the Ontario method is useful and important.

AB - A geometrically-nonlinear displacement method is developed for the purpose of studying the snap-through behavior of reticulated space trusses of arbitrary shape and loading. The present formulation is comprehensive and well suited for applying incremental and iterative solution techniques solving the governing system of nonlinear equations. The results of comparative studies of four efficient solution methods are presented with reference to the computational efforts. The dramatic influence of nonuniform loading and unsymmetrical stiffnesses on the snap-through load is shown by parametric studies.

AB - The inelastic behavior and failure mechanism of a reinforced concrete frame-wall system when subjected to static cyclic loads is established on the basis of a mechanical model. The validity of this model was confirmed in an earlier study by comparison with a laboratory experiment on a 10-story reinforced concrete frame-wall structure of the same dimensions and reinforcing. Using this model, the interaction characteristics between the frame and the wall are investigated.

AB - The interaction between local and Euler buckling in an imperfect I-section column produces an adverse effect on its strength. Analytical models based on the effective section method and the finite strip method which account for interaction buckling are compared with tests performed by Kalyanaraman, Pekoz, and Winter (1977). A design method based on the SSRC column curves is proposed to account for the effects of interaction buckling in I-section columns. This design method is also compared with the tests.

Results of load-deflection hysteresis loops, curvature distributions, and confining and shear steel strains are presented. Substantial enhancement of flexural and shear strength values (above those predicted using normal ultimate strength theory) was obtained. A method for predicting confined moment capacity is suggested.

AB - The reliability of buildings under winds is evaluated. The uncertainties in terms of the first and second statistical moments are included in the formulation. The dynamic response of the structure is obtained based on a random vibration analysis. In estimating the statistics of the wind load effects, uncertainties in the wind environment parameters and dynamic structural properties are considered. Risks of exceeding various safety and serviceability limit states are evaluated at critical sections of a 25 story steel building. Results indicate that uncertainties in the dynamic structural properties and wind environment parameters contribute significantly to the risk. The risk is also sensitive to the form of the extreme value distribution and errors in sampling and estimation of distribution parameters. The proposed method provides a tool for a comprehensive assessment of reliability of structures under wind loadings.

AB - A method for computing the probability distribution of combined, time varying loading on a structure is presented. The point crossing method is based on finding a close upper bound to the mean upcrossing rate of a linear combination of scalar load processes. Both smooth, continuous processes and pulse-type processes are included. The solution is a series of single convolutions of two natural descriptors of the load effect process: the first-order or arbitrary-point-in-time probability distribution and the mean upcrossing rate function. An example of the combination of three load processes is included, and the method is compared with others. Implications for load modeling and a format for combined loads in deterministic design codes are analyzed.
