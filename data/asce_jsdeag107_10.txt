AB - A series of full-scale structural static and dynamic tests were erformed to characterize selected properties of a 1200-kV mechanical test line. Prior to the experiment tests, a finite-element analysis of the test tower was conducted. The analytical techniques used to determine the static and dynamic behavior of a transmission tower will provide satisfactory results. Full-scale dynamic testing using the twang excitation technique proved adequate for characterizing the dynamic properties of a transmission line tower and conductor-bundle system. The importance of a pretest computer analysis to aid in experiment design is demonstrated.

AB - Mathematical formulations and solution techniques are presented for the stress analysis of circulary curved bars subjected to transverse forces in the plane of curvature. The formulation follows the semi-inverse method of Saint Venant, using a stress function. Numerical results are obtained with a finite element method, which accepts curved bars with complicated cross-sectional geometries.

AB - Wind pressure loads acting on 1:12 sloped perimeter eave sections of low-rise building models have been measured in turbulent boundary layer flow, simulating wind over open country and suburban terrains. Both local and area load measurements have been carried out for two eave widths (5 ft and 10 ft in full scale) and three eave heights (16 ft, 24 ft, and 32 ft in full scale). Data show the overestimation of peak loads which may be made if the effective uplift forces on the eaves are derived from simple local pressure measurements on upper and lower eave surfaces, and full correlation of the worst cases is assumed. A simplified chart with pressure coefficients appropriate for design is also suggested.

AB - A two-phase sequence of weight minimization is proposed as an approximate method for optimizing truss geometry and topology in preliminary design. In the first phase, the initial geometry is held fixed while member sizes are optimized. In the second phase, the nodal coordinates are optimized. The advantages of the heuristic method lie in reducing the number of structural analyses and in the control it offers the designer. Through the proposed technique, a reasonable initial geometry may be obtained which allows optimization of the topology of the structure.

AB - Cyclically reversing and monotonic shear transfer tests are reviewed for companion intitially cracked specimens of normal weight and lightweight reinforced concrete. Both composite and monolithic specimens were tested. The interfaces of all composite specimens were roughened as required by sec. 11.7.9 of the ACI Building Code, ACI 318-77. In some cases the bond at the interface was deliberately broken. In the case of monolithic specimens and composite specimens in which good bond is obtained at a roughened interface, the strength under cyclically reversing shear is about 80 percent of the shear transfer strength under monotonic loading.

AB - A total of 137 ultimate strength tests–on simple T, Y, DT, and K tubular joints is used as a basic for development of new ultimate capacity formulas. The data are taken from a variety of sources, and only relatively large geometries are considered. Axial tension, axial compression, in-plane bending, and out-of-plane bending loads are represented. The failure condition is taken as the minimum of either maximum load, first crack load, or load at an excessive deformation limit. Several formulas are recommended to predict the capacity of the different joint and load types. The accuracy of these formulas is then studied in a statistical manner. Predictions of past and present API RP 2A formulas are compared to the same data base. The new relatively simple equations are more consistent in their level of prediction and result in less scatter.

AB - The influence of internal pressure and static loads on the dynamic characteristics of cable-reinforced inflatable caps is studied numerically. The structure is modelled as a three-dimensional cable-reinforced network with the action of the membrane neglected except for transmitting pressure load to the cables. For relatively small static loads, including snow and dead weight, the natural frequencies are approximately proportional to the square root of the internal pressure. The dynamic response of the structure under the action of static wind load differs considerably from that without such loading. The static wind-type load causes the natural frequencies to vary, particulary to decrease the fundamental frequency.

AB - The behavior of outrigger-braced tall building structures is studied taking into account the flexibility of the outriggers. Expressions are developed for the core moment distribution, the top drift and the optimum location of the outriggers for minimum top drift. A characteristic non-dimensional parameter is developed that takes into account the core-to-column and core-to-outrigger flexural rigidity ratios. Graphs are plotted as functions of the characteristic parameter which allow the determination of the optimum outrigger levels for minimum drift and the corresponding core base momnet for structures with up to four outriggers. The study is based on the assumption of a uniform structure and uniform horizontal distributed loading.

AB - The study of shape optimization for skeletal structures is extended to a simple case of the finite element method using plane stress, constant strain triangular elements. Following earlier work, the method developed neglects the constitutive equations and is formulated using only node equilibrium and a stress-type objective function from plasticity theory. A form of constitutive equation subsequently appears through the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. As a result, the optimization algorithm used takes on the appearance of an analysis-redesign procedure. Two plane stress, beam-type examples are included.
