AB - A finite element model is presented for a beam initially curved in one plane but deformable in the three dimensional space. Geometric nonlinearities are included in the analysis and eigenproblems are formulated to calculate the bifurcation buckling loads of arches. Numerical results obtained for some problems indicated that [n2] had only negligible effect on the buckling load and that the rotation terms in [n1] should be deleted. Results thus obtained with the modified [n1] matrix and with only a few elements to represent the arch structure indicated very good agreement with known analytical solutions and available experimental data.

AB - One hundred twenty-six slip tests were conducted on friction-type bolted connections fabricated from A588 weathering steel. The tests were conducted mainly on specimens with mill scale or blasted surfaces which were exposed to the atmosphere for periods up to one year. The test results indicate that A588 mill scale surface has a 33 percent lower slip resistance than those reported for other steels. Suggested revisions to the AASHTO Bridge Specifications based on this behavior are presented.

AB - Experience gained from post-storm investigations of damaged buildings has made it possible to predict types of damage expected on existing buildings. Two procedures that involve different levels of engineering effort are outlined in the paper to predict wind damage to buildings. The level I procedure is a subjective one utilizing a questionnaire. Answers to the questionnaire for a particular building are used to ascertain the type and extent of potential damage to the building. The level II procedure is an analytical one. Structural analysis is performed using knowledge of wind-structure interaction, material properties, and a building's structural system to establish threshold failure wind speeds. Damage sequence and possible failure modes can be ascertained from the analysis. The two procedures have been used to predict damage to various types of ordinary buildings. The predictions are used for indentification of areas of safety for occupant protection for construction retrofitting of components to improve a building's wind resistance capabilities.

AB - Previous research at Iowa State University has resulted in a shear-bond design equation which was based on data obtained from tests utilizing concentrated line loads on one-way elements. However, since most floor slabs are usually designed for uniformly distributed loads a shear-bond formulation for such loading is required. A modification of the shear-bound concentrated loading design equation is examined for use with uniformly loaded systems. The results of laboratory service and ultimate load tests which substantiated the equation conversion are presented. The full-scale slab element tests consist of three uniformly loaded specimens which are compared with three companion specimens subjected to concentrated line loads. A description of the loading system and test procedures utilized for each type of loading is given. In addition to the shear-bond strength comparison for the tests, significant behavioral characteristics involving failure, end slip, load-deflection, and cracking are presented.

AB - An experimental investigation is conducted to substantiate a prior study of environmental stresses induced in composite-girderbridge structures. The objectives of the study were to subject a two-span test structure, with tie-rods to simulate approach-slab forces, to thermal loading, and to correlate the resulatant strains and deflections with those obtained form the theoretical study. The experimental results and theoretical values are in reasonable agreement. It is concluded that the theoretical procedure provides a rational method for predicting the thermal behavior of composite-girder bridge structures and can be applied with reasonable confidence when used with realistic temperature profiles, material properties, and substructure stiffness characteristics.

AB - A methodology for making maintenance decisions to avoid fatigue failure is proposed. The maintenance procedures developed for the drawspan mechanism of the Evergreen Point Bridge are used as an illustration of the methodology. The methodology includes, development of the stress/environment relationship for the critical member, collection of long-term environmental data and the computation of long-term stress distribution, determination of cycles at each stress level from the return period, and duration of various environmental conditions and the member frequency at the associated stress level, determination of the fatigue characteristics of the member (S-N) from a limited number of full-scale tests using the Prot procedure, and determination of yearly damage and, life expectancy using Miner's hypothesis.

AB - The behaviour of a continuous, steel-concrete composite box girder bridge was monitored during construction of the concrete deck and during the first three years of operation. It was observed that cracking developed in the deck which was attributed to the temperature developed in the deck shortly after casting, the sequence of casting, the shrinkage of the deck concrete, and the rapid heating of the steel boxes exposed to direct sunlight. It was also found that the strain distributions across the depth and the width of the steel boxes are more or less linear. This beam theory can be applied with confidence for the design of this type of structure.

AB - A section of a poststressed twin box concrete bridge is instrumented for continuous recording of temperatures within the concrete and of environmental parameters outside. The recorded data are processed with the aim of presenting it in the form suitable for analysis of similar bridges for thermal effects. It is found that the necessary data can be represented through only two design variables, namely maximum differential temperature DTMAX and base temperature BT. Analytical expressions are derived which give vertical temperature profiles as function of DTMAX and environmental parameter insolation. The value of the average temperature is similarly obtained from empirical expressions which are functions of the two design variables and environmental parameter ambient air temperature. The derived expressions correlate satisfactorily with the measured data, however further research is required to test the effect on stresses and curvatures. A flow chart is given showing main steps in design.

AB - A new method for solving discrete structural optimization problems is presented. An interior penalty function is used to convert the original constrained problem into an unconstrained parametric problem. Then the search for the optimal solution to the parametric problem is based on a discrete direction gradient. Solving an appropriate sequence of these unconstrained parametric problems is equivalent to solving the original constrained optimization problem. This method is illustrated first on a small reinforced concrete problem, and then to the design of steel building frames which are made up of standard sections. Results for a one-story four-bay unsymmetrical frame and an eight-story three-bay symmetrical frame are described.

AB - Response measurements in the laboratory of full scale glass cladding panels are presented and compared with the predictions of finite element models. The detailed static and dynamic behavior of a glass panel (window) mounted within a flexible frame and attached to a building frame by means of flexible connections was the focus of the studies. Both singles as well as double pane glass panels are handled. The present results are limited to dynamic response analyses and measurments only. The dynamic response measurements reveal the presence, as predicted, of double plate modes in which the plates move out of phase with respect to each other. One of these, involving no net interpane volume change, is found to occur at a low enough frequency to pose potential problems in large windows where significant pressure nonuniformity might provide excitation. For the range of parameters studied, the results are in good agreement with the predictions of the models and thus confirm their validity and appropriateness.

AB - The theorem of Guyon is modified for a continuous curved beam and those forces that invalidate the theorem are determined in terms of equivalent loads. For these loads, influence coefficients for stress resultants and rotations at the ends of each single span are obtained. These coefficients are used to determine the effect of a linear transformation in the two most common schemes used in continous beams, and the results obtained are compared with those for straight beams.

AB - Strength and load reversal tests were conducted on reinforced concrete beam-column connections. Fourteen tests investigated the influence of the column axial compressive stress, the amount of hoop reinforcement in the connection, the size and location of transverse beams, and the geometry of the connection region. The test results indicate that the current state-of-the-art design procedure underestimates the capabilities of concrete in the beam-column connection and overestimates the contribution of hoop reinforcement in the connection. It appears that satisfactory load reversal behavior can be achieved if the shear stress in the connection is about half of the monotonic shear strength.

AB - A model for aggregate interlock has been developed based on the behavior of micro scale. The relation between displacements and stresses across the crack faces are defined to be a function of deformation and sliding at particle level. This relation is derived for one particle projecting from one of the crack faces with an arbitrary diameter and an arbitrary embedment depth. The most probable distribution of aggregate particles, crossed by the plane of cracking and their positions with regard to this plane are assessed by a statistical analysis. The general relations between stresses and displacements for a unit crack area are obtained by integrating all particle contributions. The model proves to give adequate results, compared with experiments, carried out on several types of (cracked) concrete. Using this model, further analysis of the mechanism of aggregate interlock has been carried out, explaining tendencies observed in tests of other investigators.
