AB - The post-buckling behavior of short towers, supported by a single set of guy wires is investigated. Using the principle of stationary potential energy, a set of non-linear algebraic equations are obtained for both fixed and hinged-base towers. The equations are solved numerically for several actual systems. The results of the investigation include the shape of the post-buckling curves for towers subjected to vertical loads, the effect of cable pretension on the post-buckling behavior and the effect of horizontal forces on the capacity of the towers to supprot vertical loads.

AB - A modified modal superposition method is developed and used to evaluate the nonlinear dynamic response of a cable network composed of a linkage of straight members with lumped masses. The method is compared with Newmark's B method for accuracy and the time interval requirements for stability. To show the usefulness of the method a number of parameter studies are presented using the cable network as an example.

AB - The use of allowable stress algorithms for a simple structural optimization problem with a single frequency constraint and a constant mass matrix is discussed. The mathematical properties of the eigenvalue problem are reviewed. An Allowable stress algorithm is stated and its properties discussed. Two simple examples are presented. The primary concern of this paper lies in placing allowable stress-type algorithms within the mathematical programming literature.

AB - Two nondestructive techniques are used to evaluate the strength of wood joists in an existing structure. The traditional visual grading and longitudinal stress wave approaches are employed, with the latter technique providing better insight into the strength of the floor system. Further refinements of the stress wave method are suggested.

AB - A parametric numerical analysis is conducted on strain-hardening multi-story frames subjected to wind disturbances generated by amplifying a recorded fluctuating wind pressure. The effect of spreading and diminishing of the strain-hardening regions has been taken into account in the one dimensional finite element formulation employed here. The dynamic behavior including in particular the dynamic collapse behavior is extensively examined and the details are presented for the first time. The effect of a fluctuating wind disturbance on a frame may be represented by the required overall plastic strength, the therefore measured by a multiplier (load factor) of the basic design wind loads. There exists a critical frame which just exhibits the dynamic collaps behavior under a wind disturbance. The corresponding critical value of the multiplier has been called the dynamic collapse gust load factor. The factor provides a rational basis for a practical safety factor and is therefore recommended for a more rational method of wind resistant design of ductile structures.

AB - The special phenomena of reinforced concrete shell buckling is described on the basis of the latest results of research. The method presented takes into consideration the special properties of the reinforced concrete including, plasticity, creep, and quantity of reinforcement. Snap-through critical loads calculated by the described method are compared to the results of model tests and to the loads and critical loads of erected domes. The shell buckling stiffness was seen to be composed of two parts; the bending and the axial stiffness of the reinforced concrete cross section. The critical load is reduced by the plasticity and the imperfections. The critical load of the reinforced concrete shells decreases by the craks of concrete and increases by the reinforcement.

AB - A review of the different types of shear reinforcement for concrete flate plates is presented and the difficulties encountered when these are used in practice are reviewed. Practical shear reinforcement should efficienty increase the shear strength and ductility of the slab-column connection, and should be easy to fabricate and install. New Type of shear reinforcement which satisfies these requirements is presented. An individual reinforcing element is in the form of vertical bars with mechanical anchorages at the two ends. The size and shape of the anchors are examined as well as the arrangement of the shear elements around the column. From the results of 40 full-size tests, rules for the design of the new type of shear reinforcement are given in the form of suggested revisions to the current codes.

AB - The behavior of composite deck-reinforced floor systems under concentrated loads is described. Laboratory experiments show that these floor systems may have a considerably larger capacity to support concentrated loads than indicated by existing design techniques. There are two sources of this additional strength. First, continuity of the slab and slip restraint of stud shear connectors increase the shear bond capacity. Further benefit is obtained through the distribution of the load effects over the weak direction of the one way slab. The utilization of these benefits may produce significant economics in the design of floors to resist concentrated loads.
