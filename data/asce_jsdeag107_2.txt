AB - Semianalytical formulas are developed to predict scabbing and perforation thicknesses for reinforced concrete panels subjected to impacts by solid steel missiles. The scabbing thickness is defined as the thickness that is just enough to prevent the peeling off of the back face of the panel opposite to the face of impact; perforation thickness is defined as the thickness that is just enough to allow a missile to pass through the panel without exit velocity. In the development of these formulas, simplified models for scabbing and for perforation were assumed; engineering mechanics principles were applied in the formulation, and the Bayesian statistics were utilized to determine coefficients in these formulas. The Bayesian approach was used because it can handle the estimation of parameters better than the classicial statistical method when suitable data are limited, as is presently the case in low velocity missile impact on concrete panels.

The measured force in the slab at failure is compared to the theoretical longitudinal shear transfer strength. A procedure is outlined for the investigation of shear strength in slabs of stub girders. A numerical example is given to illustrate the procedure.

AB - An experimental investigation of wind-induced pressure loads acting on two square-plan flat-roofed model structures (50ft and 225ft high in full scale) is described. Measurements of mean, peak, and root mean square pressures acting on points and over larger roof areas have been made in turbulent boundary layer flow simulating wind over urban and open country terrains. Area loads on the roofs have been measured both by a pneumatic-averaging technique, and by using a large flush-diaphragm transducer. Correlation coefficients and spectra of effective pressure loads on various regions of the roofs are also presented. A significant overestimation of peak loads may occur for larger areas if full correlation of the worst point pressures acting over the area is assumed.

AB - A stiffness method for the analysis of monolithic beam and slab skew bridges is developed, the deck geometry being modeled with two-node beam and four-node skew plate finite elements. The T-beam action of the deck is effected by joining the centroidal surface of the beam and plate systems at the corresponding nodes by infinitely stiff connections. This form of representation implies that, at a beam-plate connection, the displacements of the two elements may be related to each other so that at such a connection there exists only one independent node. Thus, the number of equations necessary for an analysis is only of the same order as that required for a flat grillage solution. However, the necessity of prior calculation of section properties, as is required in the grillage approach, is eliminated.

AB - The induced static and dynamic response of a two-span continuous composite steel curved box-girder bridge, located in Seoul, Korea, has been examined. The deformations and strains were induced by a calibrated test vehicle. The experimental results, deflections and strains have been compared to results from three analytical techniques. The comparisons show excellent agreement between tests and theory. Because of the high torsional rigidity of the bridge, basic beam theory is adequate in prediciting the response.

AB - An effective width approach is presented for predicting ultimate strengths of thin-walled compression elements with edge stiffeners. In conjunction with procedures for predicting ultimate strengths, a requirement for adequate stiffener rigidity is given. Stiffener adequacy is assessed as that stiffener rigidity for which the ultimate strength of an edge-stiffened element equals that of an element of similar dimensions and material properties but supported by a web at the stiffener location. Critical and post-critical behavior of the assembly are studied analytically and experimentally; however, the stiffener requirement is based primarily on the experimental results. Simple formulations for assessing the performance of the stiffener and plate elements are presented.

AB - An approximate finite element method is developed for analyzing the distortional buckling of doubly symmetric I-section beam-columns. The method allows an analysis to be made of elastic uniform members under various conditions of loading, end support, and restraint. A computer program based on this finite element method is described, and the convergence and accuracy of the buckling solutions are demonstrated. The method is then used to investigate the significance of different end conditions on the elastic buckling of I-beams under uniform moment.

AB - The stress distribution in a double skin wall system is found to be very sensitive to the load distribution between the two skins. The understanding of wind load distribution between the two skins is essential to justify the design adequacy of a double skin wall system. Wind engineering research is urgently needed in this area in order to eliminate the design confusion and legal litigations arising from the dispute of the assumed wind load distribution used in the design. An example design analysis indicated that an 85% difference in the computed allowable load resulted from the two extreme wind load distribution assumptions (i.e., total load on the interior skin versus total load on the exterior skin). Using an extreme wind load distribution assumption in the design would lead to either an unsafe structure or an overconservative design.

A special characteristic of a certain class of common truss is then presented as an extension. The condition for trusses to have this charateristic is then derived, and its implications on topology, optimality and stress-ratio design are examined. Simple and more complicated examples are presented.

AB - The formulation is presented of an analytical model using the finite element technique to compute the nonlinear dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete planar structures under earthquakes. The model is based on a lumped-mass approach, and utilizes the Newmark β-method to perform the step-by-step integration of the equations of motion. This model is applied to trace the response of a three story shear-wall subject to the El Centro earthquake of May 1940. The results computed are compared with an experimental investigation.

AB - Ultimate moment capacities of H-columns with or without flexural end restraints have been computed by two methods–one including the effects of torsion and warping, the other ignoring them. Comparisons are made for both the ultimate moments and for deflections and failure modes. Some cases are indentified where torsional effects appear to have only a small influence on the moment capacity or failure mode. These include: the relatively short columns (weak axis slenderness ratio up to about 45) with no end restraints, and the longer columns (weak axis slenderness ratio up to about 75) with only minor axis flexural restraints. In some other cases, serious errors can result if torsional effects are ignored.

AB - Partially prestressed concrete beams, those which are designed for a limited level of tensile stress, have several advantages over their fully prestressed counterparts – there is a better control of camber, a savings in prestressing steel and end anchorages, and a more economical utilization of mild steel. Partially prestressed concrete beams do, however, have several disadvantages: 1) Reduction in the ultimate strength; 2) increased deflection under overload conditions; and 3) cracking. This note is based on a recent study of flexural cracking in partially prestressed concrete beams which include the examination of all available experimental data.
