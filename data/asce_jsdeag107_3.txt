AB - The finite strip method developed by Cheung is extended to include the nonlinear response of imperfect plate strips under axial compression. Local buckling and postbuckling phenomena are included in the formulation. The convergence and accuracy of the method is tested against accepted solutions for uniformly compressed plates with different boundary conditions. Studies are made of the nonlinear response of box and I-section columns. The application of the method to the interaction of local and Euler buckling of straight columns with imperfect plates is presented.

AB - Leading bridge designers have developed individual styles within limited locales, and those styles demonstrate similarities in personal esthetic ideas. An examination of the works of six major bridge designers characterizes these ideas and illustrates the striking fact that in each case these designers have done nearly all their major work in one well-defined region of a remarkably small area. The six bridge designers are: Thomas Telford (1757-1834), John Roebling (1806-1869), Gustave Eiffel (1832-1923), Robert Maillart (1872-1940), Othmar Amman (1879-1965), and Christian Menn (born in 1927). Their bridges are at least as good as, and probably better than, any of their time; there is a definite connection between the high quality of their work and its restriction to a samll well-defined geographic region. Their works illustrate a series of individual styles that spring from local conditions rather than an international style.

AB - Low-cycle fatigue tests were performed for various sizes of X-type welded tubular joint specimens. The relationship between the repeated load and the number of cycles to failure is estimated by modifying the test data based on the Bayesean theorem. The size effect and the influence of residual stress, which is called the annealing effect, are also considered. The statistical approach that is described can be applied to the fatigue test data which are stongly influenced by the scatter of welding defects. In case of low-cycle fatigue of welded tubular joint specimens, the S-N curve can be assumed as a straight line on the regular scales. Concerning the size effect in low-cycle fatigue, the relative strength of welded tubular joint specimens shows a downward trend with an increase in the size of the specimen.

AB - The buckling of the web post is investigated for steel I-beams containing adjacent rectangular web openings, and a method is presented for determining the buckling moment. An expression is derived for the effective buckling length of a web post, and its validity is demonstrated by means of tests on scale models. The elastic buckling moment of the post could then be found from elastic buckling theory, and it is used to obtain the actual buckling moment from an inelastic buckling analysis due to Nethercot and Trahair. Analysis of practial beams shows that web post buckling can affect the ultimate flexural strength of perforated plate girders, but it is not significant for rolled sections.

AB - The equations of the linear buckling theory are given in tensor notation, and the method of their solution is explained for the case of shells of revolution under axisymmetric loading. Partial differential equations are reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations introducing trigonometrical functions for the 14 unknowns of the problem. For integration, the differential equations are transformed into finite difference equations using the Hermitian (multilocal) method. Available test results are calculated and a good agreement is achieved. Parametric studies with different boundary conditions demonstrate the sensitivity of the buckling loads to the statement made for the buckling shape as a regular trigonometric configuration. The so-called classical boundary conditions prove to be very sensitive in this respect.

AB - A realistic analysis of edge stiffened cantilever slabs having linearly varying thickness in one direction (and subjected to concentrated loads) is usually done by rigorous methods that are either computer based or are too complex for everyday design office use. Semigraphical manual methods are presented which provide solutions comparable to those given by rigorous methods. The methods provide longitudinal moments in the slab and also the maximum hogging and sagging moments in the edge beams. The charts are based on grillage analogy analyses of slabs and therefore are subjected to the same limitations as the grillage analogy method, which is demonstrated to conform closely to the classical plate solution for plates of varying thickness.

AB - Experimental results for a layered lumber diaphragm are presented and compared with theoretical analysis. The influences of joists, boundary members, and layer discontinuities on deflections and strains are evaluated. The theoretical analysis overestimates deflections and strains. Layer discontinuities and boundary members have insignificant effects while gluing joists to decking results in an 18% reduction in deflection. Further tests are recommended to reach more conclusive results.

AB - When a member is subjected to bending, there is a shortening of the chord length, as shown in Fig. l. This change in length has been called bowing deformation or curvature shortening. Researchers in the area of inelastic frame analysis continue to debate the merits of including bowing in second-order analyses (l).
