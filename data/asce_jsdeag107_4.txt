AB - A specific pull-out test used to determine in-situ concrete compressive strength is analyzed. This test consists of a steel disc that is extracted from the structure. The finite element analysis considers cracking as well as strain hardening and softening in the pre- and post-failure region, respectively. The aim is to attain a clear insight into structural behavior. Special attention is given to the failure mode. Severe cracking occurs and the stress distribution is very inhomogeneous. However, large compressive forces run from the disc in a rather narrow band towards the support and this constitutes the load-carrying mechanism. The failure is caused by the crushing of the concrete in this region, and not by cracking.

AB - A numerical procedure based on the finite segment method has been presented and applied to large displacement analysis of pipe bending problems frequently encountered in offshore structural engineering applications. In this method, the pipe is treated as an assemblage of segments and the moment-curvature relation of the tubular cross section is approximated by simple mathematical expressions. Material and geometrical nonlinearities are treated using a modified incremental tangent stiffness approach. A number of numerical check problems are solved and compared with available exact solutions. Finally, the method is applied to an offshore pipe bending problem.

AB - An effective width approach is presented for predicting ultimate strengths of thin-walled compression elements with intermediate stiffeners. The study is limited to intermediately stiffened assemblies in which the stiffener is located in the center of the stiffened plate and is of relatively small width compared to the plate. In conjunction with procedures for predicting ultimate strength, a requirement for adequate stiffener rigidity is given. Stiffener adequacy is assessed as that rigidity for which the ultimate strength of each component plate element, one on either side of the stiffener, equals that of an element of similar dimensions and material properties, but supported by webs at both longitudinal edges. Critical and post-critical behavior are studied analytically and experimentally; however, the stiffener requirement is developed based primarily on the experimental results. Simple formulations for assessing the performance of the stiffener and plate elements are presented.

AB - The development of proposed design criteria is presented for pinned end columns for the load and resistance factor design provisions being developed for the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC). Available test data have been examined by regression analysis to determine a practical column strength equation for design. The study resulted in the division of slenderness into three regions: a plastic region where slenderness does not effect column strength; an inelastic region where strength decreases linearly with increasing slenderness; and an elastic region where strength is defined by a hyperbola. Equations representing column strength in each of these regions are developed, and a resistance factor to be used with these equations is derived.

AB - Gypsum is one of the indigenous materials for housing being studied by Cairo University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the Technology Adaptation Program. This program is supported by the Agency for International Development of the United States Department of State. Newly-found large deposits make gypsum attractive. Strength, density, retarders, optimum composition, and additives such as sawdust and foaming agents are examined. Solid and cored gypsum block, and the strength characteristics of walls made of such units, are compared with traditional red brick and sand-lime brick.

AB - The lateral-torsional buckling behavior of non-prismatic beams is not yet fully documented. Using the total change in potential energy during buckling, a fourth-order differential equation in the angle of twist, B, is obtained, in which the location of the transverse load with respect to the centroid is considered. Using central finite differences, this equation is transformed to a characteristic matrix eigenvalue equation. Solutions for a number of conventional tapered-beam problems are presented.
