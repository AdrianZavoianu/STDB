AB - The design, analysis and implantment of undersea suspended cable structures is explored. These structures have been located in water depths to 19,000 feet (5,800 m). The predominant external load imposed on the structures in-situ is current-induced drag; however, the design is often significantly influenced by the dynamic forces generated during implantment by the surface platform motions. Hydrostatic pressure may be the governing load in the design of some components. Analytical techniques are available for predicting the dynamic response of these structures subjected to implantment and in-situ forces. The influence of cable strumming on structural response can also be estimated. The design must consider the following: limitations to be imposed on the structure motion, the mean and maximum current profile, the corrosion and biofouling potential at the site, and the weather window for implantment. Implantment (or construction) techniques emphasize prefabrication to minimize on-site operations and time.

AB - The deterministic wave- and current-induced hydrodynamic loadings on sea-based structures are reviewed. This state-of-the-art review does not include geotechnical, surface, or installational/operational forces. Wave-induced loadings in both the small member (Morison equation) and large member (diffraction) regimes of wave force computations are reviewed. The selection of appropriate water wave theories and hydrodynamic force coefficients is included. The effects of laboratory facilities on the evaluation of the hydrodynamic force coefficients for periodic flows are also considered.

AB - A concrete gravity platform consists of a cellular caisson made up of a collection of large concrete cylinders supporting three or four large diameter tubular columns with a steel frame deck structure on top. The huge size of the overall structure, and the variety of load conditions, make it complicated to analyze all of the problems with one structural model. The complete soil-structure-water system is divided into separate systems for analysis, and then the load cases are combined with due regard for interaction effects to determine the total response. Three general classes of analyses are involved: (1) Space frames; (2) continuum type shell problems; and (3) soil-structure interaction problems. Methods of predicting elastic-plastic-fracture behavior and implosion pressure on the outer cell walls are mentioned. Kinds of failure of gravity type foundations for offshore structures are given.

AB - Offshore construction as we know it today began in 1947 with the installation of the first steel template-type structure in the Gulf of Mexico. Twenty years later there were over 2,000 such structures, and the technology had matured in the sense that much of the pioneering had been done, and the pattern was pretty well set for what are today's routine structures. The basic technology is outlined to provide one designer's perspective from which recent developments can be appreciated. This present state of practice is codified in API RP 2A. The outline cites 197 landmark papers from among the over 2,600 which appear in the Preprints/Proceedings of the Offshore Technology Conference, as well as 88 other key reference from other sources.

AB - The Delphi method of highly structured group communication is described. The method is characterized by anonymity of responses from a panel of experts, controlled feedback with a statistical description of responses, and multiple iterations to reach a consensus. It is designed to extract the maximum unbiased information in reaching the most reliable results. The basic philosophy, historical development and relevance of the method to structural design loads are addressed. The Delphi method is applied to the revision of design live loads for American National Standard A58, Building Code Requirements for Minimum Design Loads in Buildings and Other Structures. A panel of 25 outstanding structural engineers was formed and two interactions used to produce final recommended changes to the standard. A detailed discussion of the conduct of the Delphi and the implementation of the changes is included. The method offers potential for additional application in structural engineering.

AB - A large, U-shaped, thin-walled, reinforced concrete beam, restrained at both ends with heavy diaphragms, was subjected to torsional moment at midspan and tested throughout postcracking and post yielding ranges to its ultimate capacity. Measured strains in the longitudinal steel, and stirrups, and torque-angle of twist curves, torque at yielding and cracking were compared with predictions based on the theoretical models proposed by the writers in a companion paper. Very good agreement was obtained.
