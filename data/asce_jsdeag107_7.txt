AB - Much progress has been made in recent years in the art of long-span bridge design and construction. Modern long-span bridges tend to have a more graceful appearance, a breakaway from the traditional shapes, and an economical, light structure resulting in savings in material and labor. In the future, the possible introduction of new materials, the improvement in fabrication and erection techniques (as well as in analytical theories and methods), and the development of new forms of bridges may not only make it possible to increase the maximum span lengths further, but also to produce more economical, more graceful, and almost maintenance-free structures. Also included are lists of all major long-span bridges according to bridge types, giving the span lengths, years of completion, special features, and other information.

AB - The ASCE Committee on Loads and Forces on Bridges has studied the information available on bridge loading and makes its recommendations. Recommendations significantly different to current code practice are made for long span traffic loading, braking, fatigue, wind, temperature, earthquake, snow, ice and friction forces. Little change is recommended at this time to short span traffic loading and impact.

AB - Analytical studies of the elastic and inelastic response of reinforced concrete frames subjected to earthquake motion are presented. The effect of stiffness degradation on the seismic response and in particular on ductility demand is examined. Several single-story frames are analyzed; stiffness degradation significantly increases ductility demand in short period systems. Studies of multistory frames are also presented; stiffness degradation again increases ductility demand but the effect is pronounced only in the upper stories. The bending moments and forces induced in an inelastic multistory frame are smaller than those in a purely elastic frame. However, if the columns are designed to remain elastic while the girders yield, the reduction in the column moments and axial forces is not as large as that in the girder moments.

AB - The responses of 23 single family residences to motions from surface mining blasts were analyzed with Fourier power spectral density and transfer functions to determine their dynamic response properties. The fundamental frequency of the structural frames, which had an average value of 7.0 Hz, decreased with increasing height of the structure. The damping of these structures was observed to increase with increasing induced absolute motions. Walls vibrating in flexure had fundamental frequencies higher than those of the structural frames (12 Hz - 21 Hz). These results apply directly to the study of the response of structures subject to ground motions from mining activities, and are also useful for the study of response to earthquakes.

AB - Full-scale tests were conducted on two radially reinforced Douglas-fir beams. The two beams, each with a span of 30 ft., were tested only to initial failure prior to repairing. The two beams were repaired by radially reinforcing each by a different method. The radial reinforcing was similar to the field repair carried out on beams which fail in service. Each beam was instrumented for strain and deflection measurements and tested under working loads. In addition, load tests were conducted to beam failure, which occurred in radial tension for both beams. A factor of 1.6 was observed between the strength of the repaired beams and that of the unreinforced beams, clearly indicating that reinforcing a broken beam can restore the original load carrying capacity. The strength predictions for unreinforced and reinforced-unbroken test beams show that the American Institute for Timber Construction's current 15 psi radial stress limit for unreinforced Douglas-fir is quite conservative and that the 55 psi limit for reinforced Douglas-fir may be high for some beam configurations.

AB - A plastic design method is presented on minimizing the structural weight of n-span continuous beams with variable cross sections. The loads applied to the beam are combined loads consisting of a concentrated live load and a uniformly distributed live and dead load. The method which obtains optimum cross sectional shapes is explored. The plastic design method of n-span continuous beams consisting of any span length is presented, and the obtained required plastic moment distributions under combined loading are shown. Optimum I-shape sections, which lead to minimizing the beam weight, are given. The modified stepped beams corresponding to the required plastic moment distributions are determined by the dynamic programming approach. Practical design charts are supplied.

AB - The use of fatigue notch factors is proposed for specifying the relationship between the allowable stress range and the number of loading cycles. This is done by premultiplying the stress range with a fatigue notch factor which accounts for the severity of the detail's stress concentration. The method simplifies the manner in which fatigue specifications are written, and it conveys the idea of classification of details by severity of stress concentrations; it is most suitable for use in computer-aided analysis and design. The proposed equations for redundant load path structures give stress range values closer to those corresponding to the lower confidence limit at two standard deviations of the mean than the rounded off values in the specifications. The proposed equations for nonredundant load path structures are set at a uniform 5.5 standard deviations below the mean.

AB - The post-yield flexural characteristics of prismatic members with bilinear moment-curvature properties are investigated. The objective is to improve point hinge modeling of such members for inelastic dynamic analyses of large structures subjected to seismic excitations. By comparing incremental secant stiffness ratios derived under different loading patterns, an antisymmetric end loading can be used to derive improved average post-yield properties that approximately account for the spread of yielding. Subsequently, two sets of curves are presented for use in practical applications; the first gives equivalent post-yield stiffness ratios and the second the corresponding idealized yield moments. Ductility factors frequently used in practice are also examined, and some clarifications are made that are aimed at eliminating certain ambiguities associated with such factors.

AB - The problem of how to control a structure against random disturbance of known statistical properties is investigated. An optimal control law can be found as a combination of closed-loop control and open-loop control. The open-loop control depends on the statistics of the disturbance, but the closed-loop control depends on the current response of the structure. The approach is used for controlling a sample span bridge against the effect of the irregularities of the bridge deck. The irregularities are assumed to be stationary random processes with known mean and variance. A comparison between the controlled and uncontrolled responses is considered.

AB - An automated procedure is presented for the optimum design of large frameworks having size, stress and displacement constraints. The main feature of the algorithm is the use of a simple redesign procedure that is based on a generalized optimality criterion derived directly from the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. These conditions define an algorithm for the selection of improved designs for building frames in addition to being the necessary test for optimality. In addition, displacement and stress constraint derivatives are derived for multi-variable elements with several stress components. The energy-based approach for calculating behavior gradients has been extended to include the stess gradients for members of rigid plane frames. This formulation permits gradients to be determined for little cost and thus it complements the efficiency of the new generalized optimality criteria method. The efficiency of the complete algorithm has been demonstrated by optimizing the design for two relatively large frameworks, one having 30 members and the other 105 members.

The positive and negative moments in the encasement caused by the design loading conditions can be determined, in part, by applying moment distribution around the encasement. A problem arises, however, in determining the carry-over factors and fixed-end moments to be used in the moment distribution calculations.
