AB - The displacement and stress responses are presented for Pine Flat Dam to the S69E component of the Taft ground motion only, and to the S69E and vertical components acting simultaneously. For each of these excitations, the response of the dam is analyzed four times corresponding to the following four sets of assumptions: (1) Rigid foundation, hydrodynamic effects excluded; (2) rigid foundation, hydrodynamic effects included; (3) flexible foundation, hydrodynamic effects excluded; and (4) flexible foundation, hydrodynamic effects included. Based on these results, the separate effects of dam-water interaction and dam-foundation rock interaction, and the combined effects of the two sources of interaction, on earthquake response of dams are investigated.

AB - Current Navy criteria specifies that for important buildings a site seismicity study shall be performed and the design earthquake level shall be taken as the site acceleration having an 80 percent chance of not being exceeded in 50 years. Construction cost increases are reviewed for seismic strengthening and expected damage from seismic shaking. Economic factors techniques were used to study earthquake design levels. Results indicate optimal least cost designs occur at lower design levels than is specified by current criteria.

AB - Various simplifying assumptions, commonly used in the design of unbraced multistory steel building frames, are explored. An analysis program was developed to account for the nonlinear flexibility of the girder-column connections as well as for the response to variable load histories. Analyses were performed on three different structures. The results show the importance of including actual connection behavior for realistic prediction of sway and internal forces. The possibility of the occurrence of alternating connection plasticity is also pointed out. The inclusion of linearly-elastic connection flexibilities in the analysis appears to lead to very satisfactory results.

AB - The pipe whip problem is a highly nonlinear problem which, except for special conditions, is usually solved numerically. When a dynamic load is applied to the base of a pipe (striker) whose end impacts another pipe (target), it is possible for both the striker and the target to experience plastic deformations during impact. A finite element solution considering the nonlinear impact problem with material nonlinearity has been carried out. At the point when the material becomes plastic, high frequency oscillations can set up in the continuum model. Experimental data indicate that these oscillations quickly disappear due to material damping. The effects of plasticity are considered, as are Rayleigh damping and nonlinear damping in the target material.

AB - Time history analysis of 1DOF systems with and without a tuned mass damper, subjected to a set of historical earthquakes, shows that the peak response ratio (ratio between the peak responses with and without damper) depends primarily on damping constants and on earthquake duration. The same analysis reveals that response ratio values are widely scattered and that the mean response ratio in underestimated by conventional stationary random vibration calculations. Improvement is obtained by considering response movement and broadening of the response spectral density function caused by the damper. Based on these considerations, a probabilistic model is developed that gives the distribution of peak response of buildings modified by addition of a tuned mass damper in terms of the same distribution for the unmodified structures. For elastic systems tuned mass dampers have small antiseismic effectiveness.

AB - The time-history response of a three-dimensional reinforced concrete frame structure to concurrent earthquake ground motions is analyzed. Yielding is allowed in both beams and columns by a series of yield surface options selected according to the principal structural actions of the component elements. Comparisons between the behavior patterns arising from unidirectional and concurrent earthquake loading indicate that the non-linear response predicted by a full three-dimensional analysis is significantly different from the response based on a planar frame idealization. Concurrent loading causes asymmetric distribution of yield as a result of the interaction of the orthogonal displacement components, and this gives rise to an eccentricity between the mass and the instantaneous center of stiffness at some levels in the building. Nominally symmetric buildings can develop torsional responses in moderate earthquakes.

AB - A simple analysis is presented for predicting the ultimate load carrying capacity of slender plate girder webs subjected to edge loading, uniformly distributed between vertical web stiffeners, and combined bending. The analysis is based on an assumed failure mechanism which considers the formation of plastic hinges in the flange and yield lines in the web. An alternative mechanism solution is also considered for situations in which failure may be initiated by direct yielding of the web. The analysis is compared with a limited number of existing test results and is found to give satisfactory agreement.

Load and resistance factors are developed to convert existing code requirements into a limits states design format. Comparisons of the resulting factors are obtained by examining existing codes from several European countries as well as the National Design Specification of the United States. Current factors vary significantly. Use of the load and resistance format for design of wood structures is propose, based on further studies using probability-based criteria.

AB - The origin, growth and contributions of the Structural Stability Research Council are examined. Originally named the Column Research Council, the organization has annually provided a forum on structural stability by bringing together researchers from all parts of the world. The Council has initiated research, and it has cooperated with specification writing bodies. Three successive editions of the council's design guide have been published; a fourth is underway. Research contributions include: (1) The recognition and quantification of the residual stress effect on column stability; (2) the definition and application of the strain-hardening modulus in steel; (3) the determination of maximum inelastic column strength; and, (4) through the council's technical memoranda, the establishment of methods and criteria for tests of columns and metals in compression.

AB - A numerical procedure is presented for predicting elastic and inelastic beam buckling loads. The procedure uses a finite difference solution to the differential equations defining lateral torsional buckling. The reduction in beam stiffness in the inelastic range is estimated by using an approximate tangent modulus method. A computer program has been developed using the numerical procedure presented for general elastic and inelastic buckling solutions. Solutions from the program are compared against approximately 123 test buckling results. Inelastic program buckling solutions are compared with and without using the shear center adjustment method. The approximate tangent modulus method and the shear center adjustment method agreed favorably with the test results.

AB - The effects are analyzed of torsional coupling on the earthquake response of simple one-story structures in elastic and inelastic ranges of behavior. The structures considered are symmetrical about one principal axis of resistance, resulting in coupling only between lateral displacement along the perpendicular axis and the torsional displacement. Torsional coupling arising only from eccentricity between centers of mass and elastic resistance is considered. Systems with several resisting elements are idealized by a single element model. Response of such a model to a selected earthquake ground motion are presented for a range of the basic structural parameters. The response quantities presented include maximum lateral and torsional deformations of the system as well as maximum deformations of individual columns. The response in the inelastic range of behavior is effected by torsional coupling to generally a lesser degree than elastic response.

AB - An approximate method for the design of long, high-rise buildings under horizontal wind loading is described. The method is based on the reduction of the framed structure to one built-in column with equivalent bending and torsional stiffnesses. Discrete actions of the horizontal members on the columns are distributed over the story heights. The floors are treated as rigid in the horizontal plane. The calculation is reduced to the solution of a system of four linear equations; the determination of internal actions only requires some very simple operations. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated by comparison to the displacement method.

AB - The performance of lap splices subjected to impact loading was studied and compared with that of splices under static loading. Nineteen specimens were tested under impact loading, with failure produced in either one impact, in the three to five impacts of incrementally increasing magnitude, or under either unidirectional or reversed cycling of the impact load. Analytical studies were carried out to help evaluate the experimental data. The impact moment capacity of the splices tested was equal to or greater than the static moment capacity. The splice strength achieved under impact could be computed using material strengths adjusted for the strain rate imposed. Under large impact loads (producing high strain rates), the moment capacity of the splice region can greatly exceed the static moment capacity, but failure occurs after only a few load applications. With smaller impacts loads, more cycles of load were carried before failure.

AB - The general solution of the restrained warping of beams in three-dimensional frames has been developed. The general beam strain-displacement relations are used in developing a finite element solution to this problem. The solution can account for arbitrary cross-sectional shapes and arbitrary loadings. It also accounts for the coupling between the different internal forces of the beam. The concepts of continuous and restrained warping are introduced as an aid in analyzing general three-dimensional framed structures. The known analytical solutions of simple problems are predicted by the finite element solution. The method is used in a case study of a massive three-dimensional turbine generator pedestal. The warping restraints are found to have a considerable effect on the computed displacements and stresses.

AB - Light, cold formed steel sections have been arc welded without the benefit of a general guiding specification for many years. By the late 1960's the structural use of the fastening was sufficient to create a demand for a more systematic approach. In a series of tests at Cornell University, the behavior of the most common types of arc welds in sheet steel has been studied, and strength prediction equations have been derived. The strength prediction equations can be converted into design equations through the use of appropriate safety factors. Except for the case of the arc spot welds, the correlation between the test results and the computed results is quite satisfactory. In the case of the arc spot welds, the variability of the quality of welds has led to a rather large scatter in the test results.

AB - The available failure hypotheses for masonry under combined stresses are reviewed. The applicability of the failure theories for composite materials to masonry is examined utilizing experimental results of concrete block masonry test. Failure theories for isotropic materials are not applicable to masonry. Also, failure theories for composite materials cannot be directly applied to predict the masonry strength under biaxial stresses. Failure criteria are proposed for masonry under biaxial stresses, taking into consideration its anisotropic nature as a composite material. Two failure criteria are proposed, with each describing a single mode of failure‚Äîa shear failure along one of the criterical bed or head joint direction, and a tension failure incorporating the interaction of the block, mortar and grout. The proposed criteria are capable of predicting both the mode of failure and the strength of concrete block masonry under biaxial stresses.
