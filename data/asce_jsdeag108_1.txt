AB - A four-part state of the art summary on fatigue reliability is presented by the ASCE Committee on Fatigue and Fracture Reliability. This first part reviews fatigue models commonly used by designers, e.g., the characteristic S-N curve for high cycle fatigue and the general strain life relationship for low cycle fatigue as well as the fracture mechanics approach. Statistical models (i.e., the Weibull and lognormal) used to describe the distribution of cycles to failure fatigue data, are summarized. An example of analysis of S-N data is presented.

AB - Periodic reevaluation of a structure by inspection and proof loading with repair when needed is an alternative to complete dependence on initial quality for obtaining structural reliability. The theory of reliability of fatigue sensitive structures in service is developed. Changes in the probability density functions for strength and fatigue crack length under programs of proof loading or inspection are illustrated. Proof loading truncates the lower tail of the strength distribution. Inspection shifts the distribution upward. The state of the art of inspection for cracks is presented in a review of nondestructive methods and a detailed discussion of visual inspection. Maintenance principles are discussed and several successful repair procedures noted. The economic analysis of inspection and repair programs is outlined.

Models for computing fatigue damage associated with various statistical distributions of stress ranges are reviewed. The Palmgren-Miner rule is described and statistical summaries which provide a description of the performance of Miner's rule is presented. A closed form expression for fatigue damage under wide band stress spectra is given. Finally, methods of predicting fatigue crack growth under variable amplitude stresses are reviewed.

AB - This is the fourth in a series of four articles prepared by the ASCE Committee on Fatigue and Fracture Reliability. This paper summarizes how criteria for assuring integrity against fatigue and fracture may be developed using principles of engineering reliability analysis as a basis. The probabilistic treatment allows specification-writing groups to consider explicitly uncertainties that affect fatigue performance and fracture susceptibility when setting practical criteria for design. However, this treatment need not lead to more complex provisions at the design level. Several illustrations of these concepts are given.

The model, which was a 1:2.82 scale replica of a typical California highway system prototype, had overall dimensions of 72 ft (21 m) long by 12 ft (3.7 m) wide, with two spans and a skew center bent diaphragm. Results are given for reactions, deflections, strains and moments due to working stress point loads applied before and after overload stress levels in the bridge. The adequacy of analytical methods for the assessment of the structural response is discussed.

The model, which was a 1:2.82 scale replica of a typical California highway system prototype, had overall dimensions of 72 ft (21 m) long by 12 ft (3.7 m) wide, with two spans and a skew center bent diaphragm. Experimental and theoretical results are considered for reactions, steel and concrete strains, deflections, and moments due to conditioning overloads producing stress values as high as 2.5 times the nominal design stress. The loading to failure is described in detail. The ultimate strength behavior is examined on the basis of postulated collapse mechanisms and the bridge is observed to possess an excellent overload capacity.

AB - An experimental program examined the effect of A588 steel specimens with transverse stiffeners and attachments. It was found that two years of continuous weathering, prior to stress cycling to failure, reduced the fatigue life of the specimens with stiffeners and attachments by 19 and 6 percent, respectively, as compared to the non-weathered control specimens. Two years of alternating between 6-month weathering and one-quarter-life stress cycling had no significant effect on the fatigue life. The present data, in conjunction with earlier results, suggest a larger weathering-induced loss in fatigue life the more fatigue strength the specimen had in a non-weathered state. Since weathering prior to cycling affects only the crack initiation phase, whereas unpainted A588 bridges are continuously exposed to the environment, it is prudent to regard the fatigue strength of the weathered specimens as an upper bound on the fatigue strength such details would exhibit on actual structures.

AB - An experimental investigation to study composite beams with rectangular web openings is presented. Six composite beams and one steel beam were tested. W14 × 34, W18 × 45 and W18 × 46 sections were used. Opening sizes were fixed, with depths equal to 60 percent of the steel beam depth and lengths equal to twice the opening depth. Concrete slab dimensions were held constant. Opening locations were varied to investigate moment-shear ratios ranging from 3 to 33 feet (0.9 to 10 m). Web openings reduce the strength of composite beams. Beams with high moment-shear ratios fail by general yielding in the steel below the neutral axis and crushing in the concrete. Beams with medium to low moment-shear ratios fail by the formation of plastic hinges in the steel below the opening, accompanied by a diagonal tension failure in the concrete slab. The concrete in composite beams contributes significantly not only to the flexural strength, but also to the shear strength of the beams at web openings.

AB - The presentation of rehabilitation plans for bridge structures requires engineering analyses of various strengthening schemes. The use of scale models as an alternate approach to conceiving and evaluating these rehabilitation schemes is examined. These schemes would be applied to the bridge in a manner that would affect the entire structure, not simply localize repairs. Schemes conceived make use of steel rods, or cables, or both. Data is presented for the experimental, and theoretical, performance of a one-seventh scale unreinforced model, in addition to the experimental results of two preliminary reinforcing schemes. Also presented are questions that arise from rehabilitation work of this type that only model analysis, supported by theoretical analysis, can answer. Emphasis is placed upon the design of the model since accurate modeling is required for accurate results.

AB - The effect of external hydrostatic pressure on the cross sectional behavior of fabricated tubular columns is studied analytically using tangent stiffness approach. The moment-curvature behavior of a short column is of prime importance in the analysis of any long beam-column. The results will be applied to study the effect of external pressure on the strength and behavior of long beam-columns. The fabricated tubular column contains imperfections such as out-of-roundness and longitudinal and transverse residual stresses. These imperfections combined with the effect of external pressure are studied in the present analysis. Tresca yield criterion is used for elements in biaxial stress state, which is induced by the interaction of axial stress and longitudinal and transverse residual stresses and magnified by external pressure. A computer program has been developed to obtain numerical results from which practical design formulas are derived for cross-sectional capacity of fabricated tubular columns subjected to axial force, bending moment and external hydrostatic pressure.

AB - Studies are reported of the response to uniformly distributed loading of parabolic arches of rise equal to a fourth of the span. Base conditions are both fixed and pinned. The distributed loading varies between covering less than half the span to covering the complete span. The numerical studies use a discrete element, large deformation method that enables the prediction of the complete load-deformation history of an elastic arch up to full inversion if necessary. Account is taken of axial as well as flexural strains and, under full span loading published data are confirmed for the load intensities at which equilibrium bifurcation occurs. The significant result is that the intensity of load that can be supported by a fully elastic arch is significantly less than the bifurcation value when approximately three-fourths of the span is loaded. The reduction in load intensity is appreciable for both fixed and pinned arches.

AB - Shear tests on push-off specimens are carried out in order to study the strength and deformation behaviour of normal and lightweight concrete. Two types of specimen are used, one with embedded reinforcing bars and another with external restraint bars. In both series the experimental results show the dilatancy of cracked concrete under shear loading. The variables studied are the concrete quality, concrete composition, the reinforcement ratio, the bar diameter, the initial crack width and the influence of repeated loading. The concrete quality and the reinforcement ratio have the most pronounced influence on the behaviour. For the case of the external restraining force, diagrams are established to show the relation between shear stress, normal stress, crack width and shear displacement.

AB - The problem of dynamic alongwind response of structures to forces induced by atmospheric turbulence is treated in this paper. Starting from the classical formulation, the study analyses the behaviour of two structural standard models, called point-like and threedimensional, respectively. The treatment of the problem presented in the paper leads to a closed form expression of the alongwind response. The remarkable simplicity and the very high precision of the proposed method is pointed out in general terms and illustrated by two examples. In conclusion, some prospects for possible future applications referred to this solution are outlined and briefly discussed.

AB - Prismatic members of structural frameworks are conventionally analysed by using a simplified model supplied by the engineering beam theory. The paper considers the possibility of extending that model to members of varying cross sections; such extension is warranted provided the variation is smooth and not too large. The flexibility parameters which represent the elastic behavior of such members are calculated by means of simple quadratures. Explicit expressions and charts are presented for an important class of tapered beams. As an alternative to the usual representation of a member in terms of a stiffness of flexibility matrix, an equivalent model, consisting of two or three uniform segments, is suggested. Simple formulas are derived for that purpose and their application is numerically demonstrated.

AB - Tensioned cable structures are becoming increasingly popular for covering large column free areas. Among the various forms of cable roof systems used, the truss form is the most popular because of its simplicity and versatility. These structures exhibit a non-linear structural response and thus pose a special problem of analysis. A study of the comparative behaviour of different types of cable truss configurations is presented. The influence of design parameters, such as sag to span ratio, cable sizes and prestressing forces, upon the response of the structure has been investigated for various truss forms with unyielding supports subjected to both symmetrical and unsymmetrical loading conditions.

AB - The bond action between concrete and deformed bars in lap splices is analysed in its different working stages. The principal tensile stress generated by bond stress cracks the concrete after which bond gives rise to splitting forces. These forces cause longitudinal cracking of the cover. A method for determination of this cracking load is proposed. The stress distribution along the lap length is analysed with modulus of displacement theory for different bond stages. The final bond failure by splitting of the cover according to minimum stressed failure pattern is analysed. The effect of confining reinforcement is discussed. Methods for calculation of bond resistance in lap splices are proposed and compared with tests.
