AB - Analytical and experimental studies were performed on straight-soffited, double-tapered glulam beams. Full-scale tests were conducted under working loads to evaluate the applicabiLity of the finite element method for theoretical analysis. Two Douglas-fir and two Southern pine beams, each with a span of 30 ft (9.1 m), were studied. Each was instrumented for strain and deflection measurements. Experimental flexural and perpendicular to grain tensile stresses were compared with theoretical predictions. Load tests were also conducted to failure. Both Southern pine members failed in tension due to bending, whereas the Douglas-fir members failed in tension perpendicular to grain. The interaction of stresses concept of failure is evaluated in light of the test results observed in this study.

AB - Analytical and experimental studies were conducted on Glulam members with tapered configuration. Full-scale flexural tests were conducted under working loads. Three different geometries were investigated; namely a beam, an arch leg and an arch rafter. Each geometry was replicated in Douglas-fir and Southern pine species. Strain and deflection were measured and compared with theoretical predictions obtained by a finite element modeling. Load tests were also performed to failure. Stress results indicate that current design computations yield highly conservative stress levels. A commonly used interaction equation is evaluated in light of the ultimate strength results observed in the tests to destruction.

New predictions for cooling tower buckling are presented and compared with newly available experimental information. Various analysis techniques are evaluated, and the equivalent axisymmetric approach (including suction) is identified as a useful compromise between the accuracy and economy of calculation.

AB - Direct numerical integration of the equations of motion is used to evaluate the adequacy of modal solutions, as applied to the analysis and design of large offshore structures under wave and earthquake loadings. Two such solutions are considered: mode acceleration and simple modal superposition. Both these methods are widely used by the offshore industry but recently their adequacy in predicting member forces under wave loadings has been questioned. After reviewing the underlying assumptions and the differences between the two solutions in relation to the two types of loading, results from analyses of a template platform, modeled with 1,428 degrees of freedom, are compared to those obtained by a direct solution in geometric coordinates. It is found that for wave loadings the mode acceleration method gives excellent results, while simple modal superposition can lead to erroneous member forces and stresses even if a large number of modes is used. For earthquake loadings, on the other hand, mode acceleration is not any better than simple modal superposition, which gives answers that may be considered acceptable for design applications.

AB - The techniques of discrete field analysis are utilized to investigate the response of X-braced trusses to various static loading conditions. Deflection formulas for arbitrary static loads are presented in finite Fourier series form. These formulas are used to derive stiffness coefficients which comprise the equivalent beam element stiffness matrix for a given X-braced truss. Fixed end moments for arbitrary static loads are also derived from the deflection formulas. All stiffness formulas are exact in the context of linear, elastic truss analysis and are valid for an arbitrary number of panels. These stiffness coefficients when compared to approximate estimates are found to vary by as much as 100% within a given range of span lengths. The formulas can be used to analyze a variety of structural systems which have X-braced trusses as the basic component. Examples include two-way truss systems, trussed frames, and planar trusses continuous over several supports. The analysis of such systems would be identical to that in which the individual components were beams except that here modified stiffness coefficients would be used.

AB - Creep and shrinkage measurements are reported on three steam-cured and one moist-cured control concrete. Half the specimens were stored in a constant environment of 70Â° F and 50% RH, and half were stored outdoors in central Illinois. The shrinkage of the outdoor specimens was much less than in the laboratory, as expected, but the creep strains were comparable in spite of the large difference between the average relative humidities of the two environments. This high creep in a relatively moist environment must be taken into account if the loss of prestress in prestressed concrete structure and the time-dependent deformations of all concrete structures exposed to variable environments are to be properly predicted. Annual cyclic expansions and contractions occurred in all outdoor specimens.

AB - The wind-induced pressure inside buildings has a profound effect on building safety. Yet, little attention has been given to it in the past. The effect is either ignored or improperly considered in contemporary building codes or standards. This paper seeks to clarify the matter and improve the way internal pressure is considered in the design of buildings. Both static and dynamic effects of internal pressure are considered herein. The dynamic effects include the overshooting of internal pressure following the breakage of a windward window during high wind, and the Helmholtz resonance created by any disturbance. Combined effects of internal and external pressure variations are also reviewed.

AB - Wind tunnel tests were conducted to determine the increase in drag on flat plate and luminaire models due to the proximity of nearby models of like shape. Test results showed drag increases of up to twenty percent due to interference between the flows around the two bodies. The maximum interference drag generally occurred at a spacing of about 20% of a single model width. Several models exhibited a pronounced dip in the data where interference drag first decreased and then increased again. On the luminaire model this resulted in an optimum spacing where the interference drag went to zero.

AB - Twenty-one two-span continuous beams with nominally identical cross sections of welded I-250x100x6x8 mm are tested in seven groups of three, each group having different span length. These continuous beams are tested under a concentrated load on the midspan of one side span. The continuous test beams are on the simple and clamped supports at the both ends against in and out-of plane displacements with an intermediate support. The test results are compared directly with the buckling behavior of simple beams and also with the buckling results based on the effective length concept. The ultimate strengths of the present continuous beams are higher than those of simple beams and scatter between the elastic buckling strength curves of simple beams and of propped cantilever beams which are considered to have a nonloaded span with infinite rigidity. However, in the plot of (Pu/Py) vs (Î» = Py/PE) the test results of continuous beams scatter on the lower part of the results of simple beams and the coefficients of variation are close to the values of simple beams.

AB - Theoretical formulae are presented for the various rigidities of non-orthogonally shaped waffle concrete slabs for both the precracking and postcracking stages. The deduced expressions for the flexural, coupling and torsional rigidites are applicable to both reinforced and prestressed concrete constructions. Experimental results derived from tests on twelve non-orthogonally shaped waffle concrete slabs verify and substantiate the theoretical derivations. The effect of creep on the rigidites is discussed and a method to account for it is suggested. The use of reliable estimates of the rigidities should lead to a more economical and better design of such waffle-type structures.

AB - An analytical study of the inelastic cyclic load-deflection behavior and load-shortening behavior of axially loaded steel tubular bracing members subject to cyclic loading is presented. Expressions are first derived for the moment and axial strain expressed explicitly in terms of curvature and thrust for tubular sections with geometric imperfections and residual stresses. For the case of reversed loading, several approximations of the moment-thrust-curvature curves and moment-thrust-axial strain curves are made. Using these relations, cyclic solutions of pin-ended columns subjected to one cycle of axial loading are obtained and compared with some available experimental tests. Good agreement is generally observed.

AB - A five-span, four-hundred-foot long, reinforced concrete box girder birdge supported on single column piers that are pile-founded was subjected to extensive dynamic tests. The pullback and quick-release method of excitation was used. Two D-8 crawler tractors were used to apply total release loads that had a magnitude of about one-quarter of the earthquke design loads. The transverse mode shapes and natural frequencies obtained from these tests were used in conjunction with the system identification procedure outlined herein. By using these techniques, it is possible to identify the in situ dynamic stiffnesses of the pier foundations as well as the abutment structures. In addition, the dynamic bending and shear stiffness factors for the superstructure deck were also obtained. Thus, carefully conducted dynamic tests of full-scale highway bridges provide detailed information about the structure. At the same time, they shed much experimental light on the soil-structure interaction aspects of the problem, which in many cases greatly affects the distribution of seismic loads in bridges.

AB - A theory is developed for the non-linear or linear analysis of arbitrary composite sections subjected to biaxial loading. The accuracy of the theory is verified by comparison with known uniaxial non-linear analyses of steel wide-flange and channel sections encased in reinforced concrete, with classical linear theory based on principal moments of inertia, and with test results from various authors. Three basic shapes of concrete stress-strain diagram are considered, for two allowable compressive strains and two ultimate strengths. This gives twelve different types of concrete stress distribution which are used to analyse four different composite sections. A comparative study of the results indicates that the factor which most influences ultimate biaxial bending strength and curvature is the allowable concrete compressive strain. The shape of concrete stress distribution has little effect on the section behavior.

It is shown that already small correlations between loads can substantially increase the probability that the sum of the loads exceeds a specified level. The asymptotic behavior of the cumulative distribution function is derived by Laplace transform methods.

Explicit formulas for correction weight changes are developed. Static measurements are compared with the continuous recording. It is shown that satisfactory measurement can be made by either method, provided that a damped oscillation occurs in the observed torque when the opening is stopped so that the static friction effect is reduced.

AB - The concept of an intelligent computer program is introduced using the design of a simply-supported wide-flange beam as a model. The key to the approach is component selection through a database organized by frequency of past usage. The programming implications are divided into acquisition of the database and application of the database. For the truly intelligent program, a dynamic feedback loop connects acquisition to application. The intelligent approach is compared to a conventional approach, binary search, with favorable results.
