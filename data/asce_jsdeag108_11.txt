AB - A single-degree-of-freedom approach is used to model structural response to superimposed airblast and ground vibration from conventional explosions. A method is used whereby the force applied to the structure by the airblast is combined with the force due to the ground motion into a single exciting force. The use of field data permits comparison of model response to actual measured structural response. Natural frequencies and damping values used in this study are typical values obtained for residential structures in other studies. The model response is similar to the actual response in frequency content, and the peak velocities are predicted within a factor of two.

AB - Finite element procedures for determining the plate bending stiffnesses of a circular voided slab are presented and the results are compared with those obtained from tests on model elastic voided plates. Preliminary investigations showed that a simplified plane-strain formulation, rather than a more complex general plane-strain formulation, could be used to determine the transverse flexural stiffness. Torsional stiffnesses were obtained from an analysis using the Prandtl stress-function formulation of the torsion problems. Tests were carried out on four epoxy-resin model plates having different void sizes. Good agreement was obtained between the finite element and experimental results. For design purposes, charts are presented which enable a designer of a concrete voided slab, having a Poisson's ratio of 0.2, to determine the values of the plate bending stiffnesses required for a thin plate analysis of such a slab. It is also shown that simple calculations based upon replacing a circular void with an equivalent square void are often adequate for design purposes.

AB - A convergent series solution, using the concept of equivalent orthotropy, is employed to analyze continuous composite bridges under static loads. The effect of the interaction between prestressing a portion of the deck slab and shear connectors in the region of the intermediate supports is examined. It is shown that prestressing the deck slab increases substantially the cracking load as well as the stiffness of such bridges. Results from tests on two bridge models verify and substantiate the theoretical analysis.

AB - The limit design of a regular rectangular reinforcing net in a concrete plate subjected to arbitrary normal and shear forces and bending and twisting moments is studied. The assumptions are: The reinforcement is plastic; concrete resists no tension; a normal crack of any direction may exist in concrete; the normal stress in concrete is constant; in-plane shear stresses can be transmitted in concrete, are of constant magnitude but possibly of alternating sign, and their ratio to the normal compressive stresses may not exceed the friction coefficient. The previously developed frictional (no-slip) limit design for membrane loading is the special case when the compression zone covers the whole thickness of the plate. Design charts for the case of no membrane forces are computed and plotted. They differ up to about 20% from the classical solution. In contrast to pure membrane loading, the frictional design for failure may yield a lighter reinforcement than the classical design. Mostly, however, it yields a heavier reinforcement. The difference vanishes when the bars are laid in the direction of principal bending moments. In contrast to the classical design, the angle between the crack and the bars does not have to be 45° for the optimum design.

AB - Formulas are presented for the analysis of typical wood-frame shear walls with sheathing attached by nails or other types of discrete fasteners. Formulas are derived for the sheathing fastener forces, for the linear shear stiffness of a wall, and for the nonlinear shear load-strain behavior of a wall. These formulas are shown to be in agreement with the results of load tests and of finite element, linear, and nonlinear analyses. Details of the load tests and finite element analyses are given. The formulas are relatively simple and should be applicable to the design of wood frame shear walls with plywood or other types of sheathing.

AB - The flexural strength of exterior panels of flat slab structures is investigated by use of Yield Line Theory. Six controlling, geometrically admissible, collapse mechanisms are identified, three of which involve local flexural failures around the columns. The loading is uniformly distributed, the columns are rectangular, and the reinforcement is arranged orthotropically. The coefficient of orthotropy and the ratio of negative to positive yield moment may vary arbitrarily. The governing equations for the six mechanisms are derived and presented in dimensionless form. Based on numerical solutions of four of the equations, a set of graphs is provided which covers practical ranges of the important physical and geometrical parameters. These graphs are useful for the analysis or design of the exterior slab panels. In addition, an equation is derived which gives an upper bound on the bending moment which the slab can transfer into the exterior column at collapse load through flexural action.

The theory considers the three important parameters: residual stresses, geometrical imperfections and nonlinear end-restraints. A computer program using finite difference technique has been developed to obtain numerical results. Several numerical results are presented to show the influence of the three parameters mentioned on the maximum strength of I-section columns and beam-columns.

AB - This paper presents a method for calculating the notional risk of overload associated with fixed offshore platforms subjected to random wave loading. The lifetime exposure of the structure to potentially damaging storms is treated within a rigorous mathematical framework. The procedure used to establish the long term extreme wave load distribution is emphasized. This procedure utilizes presently available oceanographic information in a statistical model of the wave environment. The composite probability of exceedance associated with all significant loading events is computed for a lifetime exposure to the ocean environment. For the purposes of demonstrating this procedure, only the resistance of pile foundations to overturning forces is investigated. A simplified technique for estimating the ultimate foundation capacity is presented and compared to a more rigorous method. Failure mechanisms in the jacket are not investigated, i.e., the structural jacket is assumed to be adequate to transfer loads into the pile foundation. Finally, the resistance and load effects are combined to evaluate the reliability of the pile foundation in a wave environment. Results are presented for a recently installed Gulf of Mexico platform. The sensitivity of the results to various input parameters is discussed.

AB - Rarely can historians attribute to one person the introduction into a society of a new and widely useful engineering idea. We have no difficulty, however, in attributing to one structural engineer, Anton Tedesko, the introduction of thin-shell concrete roof structures into the United States. This achievement merits some reflection not only on the events themselves, but also on the background and personality of the individual engineer. Anton Tedesko's work and ideas in thin shell concrete studies demonstrate: First, his educational background broadened his vision, emphasized design at least as much as analysis, and included aesthetics as a serious part of structural design. Second, his experience in European practice gave him not only a solid grounding in thin shell construction, but also a first-hand view of the operation of designer-builders. Third, the history of thin shell structures shows how new ideas in structural engineering came from designers and especially those with construction experience. Fourth, Tedesko's long career has focused on the design of full-scale works in which behavior, cost, and appearance have been the criteria for success.

AB - The extended Neuber solution which has the curl of a harmonic vector added to Papkovich-Neuber solution is proposed as a useful solution to asymmetric problems referring to cylindrical coordinates. A three-dimensional analysis for a laterally loaded semi-infinite cylinder embedded in an elastic half-space is presented on the basis of that solution. The potentials of displacement for a semi-infinite cylinder and an elastic half-space are given. The components of displacement and stress are expressed in those potentials of displacement. The Fourier, Bessel, and Dini expansion are used in order to satisfy the boundary and continuity conditions. Numerical calculations are made for various values of Poisson's ratios and the shear moduli of a semi-infinite cylinder and an elastic half space. Some available data for the behavior of such a structure as single piles in a foundation, anchor bolts, and reinforcements subjected to a shearing force in a concrete with cracks are presented.

AB - An empirical study was conducted to determine whether design wind speeds can be estimated confidently from short records, i.e., records extending over periods of a few years. The study was based upon the analysis of records of daily, weekly, and monthly largest wind speeds taken at 36 United States weather stations over periods ranging from three to 10 years and upon largest yearly wind speeds recorded at these stations over periods ranging from approximately 25-45 years. Investigations were presented into the type of probability distributions that best fit sets of largest daily, weekly, and monthly wind speeds and into the relationship between winds estimated from short records of largest daily and weekly wind speeds on the one hand, and from 25-year to 45-year records of largest yearly wind speeds on the other hand. The main effort in the paper was focused on the relationship between estimates of 50-year wind speeds based on three-year records of largest monthly speeds and on 25-year to 45-year records of largest yearly speeds. It was found that 50-year speeds can be estimated confidently from three-year records of the largest monthly speeds.

AB - During the preliminary plan phase of designing a steel roof space truss, a number of parameters must be considered and evaluated. These include the geometry of the framing system, the possible use of a proprietary system, the type of nodal joint, grid spacing, method of support, and depth of truss. Twelve types of truss framing systems that have been used for actual structures are presented. These systems are developed from basic elements of either rectangular or triangular prisms or from pyramids with either rectangular or triangular bases. Eleven different proprietary systems are briefly described. These proprietary systems are adaptable to closely spaced grids and shallow trusses and result in low weights per square area of structural material. Alternatively, a space truss can be developed utilizing a fabricated joint. Two examples are presented. These types of structures are usually deeper in depth with a larger module size. The weight of the structure is generally higher than that obtained by using a proprietary system. The actual weight of the truss is a secondary cost consideration. Three methods of analyses for preliminary designs are referenced. The review highlights some of the important factors that must be considered during the planning state of a steel roof space truss design.

AB - Experimental study was conducted at the University of Windsor and a composite beam system using soffits made of cold-formed steel channels was developed. The test results show good characteristics of these beams, especially with regard to their ultimate load carrying capacity and bond strength. The study shows that by replacing the standard reinforcing bars into a cold-formed steel section of equal area, the structural performance of the beam could be almost unchanged, while saving is achieved in the cost of forms and shorings. Soffits made in the form of stiffened channels with embossments performed very well as integral parts of the composite beam. The combined action of the embossments and the channel's lips lead to excellent bond characteristics between the soffit and the concrete. This can be explained by the fact that the concrete has to be lifted up in order to slide over the embossments, while this movement is restrained by the lips of the channel.
