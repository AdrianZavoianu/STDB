AB - Bolted shear web connections were tested to evaluate the 1978 AISC Specification provisions concerning edge distance, end distance, and bearing stresses. Tests were performed on beams with both standard holes and also slotted holes; single row and double rows of bolts were considered. Both coped and uncoped beams were used in the test. The results of each test are compared with the allowable service loads. For each test a plot of the connection reaction versus the deformation is presented along with a description of the behavior. Results of the tests indicate that design methods of connections which develop the full depth of the web are conservative; connections with two rows of bolts which were concentrated in the upper half of the web gave lower factors of safety than desired. Also, connections with slotted holes had less capacity than those with standard holes when edge distance was critical.

AB - Present status of the research on the beam-to-column connection in Japan is reviewed. The design philosophy of beam-to-column moment connections of steel building frames under the unique situation that the earthquake loading dominates the structural design is discussed. The importance of the contribution of the excellent shear deformation capacity of joint-panels to the overall ductility of the frames which should be developed against the extreme earthquake is emphasized. Some design criteria for the beam-to-column moment connections suitable for seismic design are suggested.

AB - The influence of realistic semi-rigid end restraint on the strength and behaviour of real steel columns is investigated. An analytical procedure is developed which includes the effects of initial out-of-straightness, spread of yield and initial residual stresses. The procedure also permits the inclusion of the nonlinear restraining effect of the column's end connections as determined by tests on actual connections. Comparisons of initial results with available experimental data for end-restrained columns are made to verify the validity of the procedure. Agreement is shown to be acceptable. Load-deflection curves and column curves are produced for a series of column assemblies including both initially stress-free and residual stress conditions. Effective length factors calculated from these results indicate possible column design economies due to the actual end restraint present. The influence of end restraint on the distribution of internal stresses and hence the initiation of column yield is also discussed.

AB - The behavior of moment connections and beam-column joints in moment resisting steel frames subjected to severe earthquakes is studied. The cyclic inelastic deformation capacities of different types of connections are discussed and design recommendations are presented that are intended to assure the development of plastic hinges in beams at the column faces. A conceptual approach to the prediction of the low cycle fatigue life of welded connections under random loading is outlined, utilizing concepts of elastic-plastic fracture mechanics. The shear behavior of beam-column joints subjected to large cyclic beam moment reversals is summarized. Based on experimental evidence and a simplified mathematical model for shear strength, a method for the shear design of joints is proposed that should permit a reduction in the demand for shear stiffeners in joints.

AB - For a beam-to-column web connection where the beam is attached to the column perpendicular to the plane of the column web, the theoretical maximum strength of this beam and column assemblage is reached when plastic hinges are formed in the column or in the beam. Other factors that limit this maximum strength include the development of yield line mechanism in column web, fracture or shear punch of column web, and shear yielding of beam flange plate. These could preclude obtaining the connection load level required to produce plastic hinges. The results of eight simulated tests on web connection details are presented. In the simulations, pairs of steel plates are welded to column sections using four different attachment details. These plates represent the tension and compression flanges of a beam attached to the column. The pair of flange plates are loaded by tension and compression forces to simulate the bending moment of a beam acting upon the column. Observations are made of stresses and deformations as well as phenomena that prevented the connections from obtaining this theoretical maximum load level.

AB - A theoretical and empirical analysis is presented for the ultimate static strength of gapped joints in welded Rectangular Hollow Section trusses having one compression bracing member and one tension bracing member. Ultimate joint strength is determined from a set of observed failure modes which are studied with the yield line method, adapted for large joint deformations, as the main analytical tool. The results of 84 tests on isolated and truss joints from three different countries have been used to successfully verify the analyses.

AB - For many years research on welded and bolted beam-to-column connections has been carried out in The Netherlands, with particular emphasis on those connections which cannot transmit the full plastic moment. This concept allows for a wide range of moment distributions in non-sway frames, thus giving the possibility of optimizing the cost of the construction in balancing the material cost of the members against the labour cost of the connections. It will be evident that for unstiffened connections special precautions should be taken in order to avoid lack of rotation capacity and stiffness of the connections. The appropriate design rules for unstiffened welded connections are bolted connections in non-sway frames are discussed.

AB - A method for analyzing reinforced concrete beams and beamcolumns is developed, and the analytical results are compared to experimental data obtained by other investigators. The present method employs the stressstrain relationships for reinforced concrete and steel bars, and considers the combined effects of flexure, shear, and axial forces. The ultimate flexural moment and rotation capacities of reinforced concrete beams is associated with the amount of shear reinforcement provided. As a result, a relationship is proposed between the ultimate flexural moment capacity, the amount of shear reinforcement, and the inclination of cracks.
