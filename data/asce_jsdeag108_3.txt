AB - The strength of aluminum pinned crooked columns has been derived as the basis of a design column curve. The effective length factor concept has then been presented and a value for crooked columns introduced (Kcrooked). This factor can only be numerically determined and has no direct theoretical relation with the classical effective length factor (Kel) derived from elastic buckling analyses. Many examples have, however, shown that Kcrooked is less than Kel and that it is conservative to base a design on Kel and a column curve derived for pinned crooked columns. It has also been shown that the amount of restraint necessary to compensate the effect of initial imperfection is strongly dependent on the slenderness ratio of the member.

AB - An experimental study is presented on the local and overall interaction buckling strength of welded built-up box columns made of high strength steel. A total of twenty-seven box columns with large width-thickness ratios were tested to failure, of which twenty-four columns were centrally loaded and the rest eccentrically loaded. Based on the test results, an empirical design formula is presented to predict the interaction buckling strength. Further, a discussion of an economical way of proportioning box sections is presented.

AB - A method for static analysis of guyed towers is extended and applied to problems in three dimensions. The tower and guy cables may be loaded by arbitrary distributed or concentrated forces, or both, and there are no apriori assumptions about cable shape (such as the usual catenary assumption). The effect of axial forces as well as shear and twist deformations in the tower are taken into account. The base of the tower may be in any support condition between clamped and hinged including either extreme in each of three rotational degrees of freedom. Cables are handled by the Method of Imaginary Reactions. For the tower, highly accurate integration algorithms for the three dimensional beam column equations are presented. Results are applied to a 1500 foot tower bearing a 15 million pound platform and other loads, and supported by 20 cables attached in four clusters at the tope of the tower.

AB - Stiffness matrix for a structural member is obtained using the differential equations derived by V.Z. Vlasov. Presence of additional off-diagonal elements over the conventional tridiagonal form is observed. A number example is shown in order to compare the relative magnitudes of elements in the stiffness matrix and some of the new off-diagonal elements are found to be of considerable importance. This stiffness matrix conclusively demonstrates the inter-relationship between the three rotational degrees of freedom. This coupling is found to reduce the value of the critical axial force below all three individual buckling loads, viz: lateral buckling about major and minor axes and torsional buckling. All these effects are attributed to an internal force called as bimoment.

AB - A new method for constructing one-layer steel grids erected by prestressing with the aid of recoverable bending forms is presented, followed by an approximate structural analysis. The grid elements are joined together by cables passing through them. By stressing other cables the flat grid erects itself to a vault, the shape of which is determined by the recoverable bending forms. The preliminary analysis covers the erection stages and dead, snow and wind loads during service. Using the results of a design example it is predicted that this new method, which dispenses with special joints on the one hand, and with high scaffolding and erection cranes on the other, will not require excessive amounts of steel.

AB - The elastic post-buckling behavior of rectangular plates in combined compression and bending is presented. The theoretical investigation begins with the Marguerre's compatibility equation and proceeds to obtain a solution by the energy method. The computer results are first compared with some available test results. Then the theoretical results are utilized to derive effective width formulas in combined compression and bending. Finally a family of post-buckling strength curves of box sections are presented that are calculated from the derived effective width formulas.

This solution can be used to simulate beams on elastic foundation with different boundary conditions. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the solution. Results for beams with simulated boundary conditions agree with those for exact boundary conditions.

AB - A model for the strength of steel-concrete composite beams with unreinforced, rectangular web openings is presented. The model includes the contribution of the concrete slab to shear strength, as well as flexural strength. Steel is represented as an elasto-plastic material with no strain hardening. Openings may be concentric or eccentric with respect to the steel section. Comparisons are made with test results. The model provides realistic, and generally conservative, predictions of the strength for the test beams. The contribution of the concrete slab to shear strength at an opening must be included to obtain a realistic model.

AB - The sagging rotation capacity of composite beams consisting of a concrete slab attached to a steel beam by a shear connection is studied. Tests are reported on four full-scale beams in the range of ductility parameter x from 0.65 to 3.0. This parameter is an index of the degree of strain-hardening developed in the steel beam at collapse. Expressions are proposed for the minimum inelastic rotation and deflection available at collapse. Examples are given of the application of these expressions to design problems with continuous composite beams. It is shown that, with a minimum value of x equal to 1.4, sufficient sagging rotation should be available to develop the conventional plastic design collapse load under the worst combinations of spans and loading.

AB - A parametric study of the strength and behaviour of an axially loaded wide-flange steel column is investigated from the viewpoint of a beam column analysis using the approximate deflection method and the bi-linear fitting for test data of moment rotation relationships of beam-to-column connections and taking into consideration the effects of residual stresses, geometric imperfections and small end restraints. A computer program is developed to obtain the numerical results, from which effective length decreasing factor and maximum load increasing factor are proposed. The validity of the computer model is demonstrated by comparison with the results of a test on an actual column.

Interaction of cable truss and network roofs with the supporting structure modelled as a spring is studied in this paper for a variation of design parameters. Both symmetrical and unsymmetrical loading conditions are considered.
