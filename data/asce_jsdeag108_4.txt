AB - A review of reliability computation methods is presented. The strength of aluminum beam-columns is described, taking into account material and cross-sectional properties, initial imperfection and load eccentricity, and comparisons are made to the interaction equation prediction. The reliability of the current aluminum code design criteria for beam-columns is analyzed by different methods. A load and resistance factor design criterion is proposed, and appropriate resistance factors are derived which are a function of the design parameters in order to offer a uniform reliability.

AB - A method to predict the ascending and the descending parts of stress-strain curve of concrete subjected to triaxial compressive stresses is presented. The proposed analytical stress-strain relationship depends on the values of the three principal stresses and strains at the ultimate compressive strength. A criterion to predict the triaxial compressive strength is proposed, which is sensitive to all three stress invariants. To enable predictions of the post-peak stress-strain relation, experiments were conducted on concrete confined by steel tube. Concretes with different compressve strengths were confined by steel tubes of varying thicknesses. The predicted stress-strain curves compared favorably with the available experimental data on uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial compression.

AB - Seventy, 5/8-in. diameter wedge anchors were tested in direct pull-out to determine the effect of various configurations of unused holes and different treatments of these holes on pull-out capacity. The test results indicated that for unused holes as close as approximately 2.0 bolt diameters, there was a measurable reduction in pull-out strength. When the holes were as far away as 3.0 bolt diameters, there was no reduction in capacity. When holes as close as 1.5 bolt diameters were filled with drypack mortar, the anchors behaved as if there were no additional holes present. Thus, no reduction in pull-out load, even the extreme case of holes 1.5 bolt diameters away from an anchor, need be considered when the holes are filled with dry-pack mortar.

AB - The strength of series-produced structures is uncertain because of modelling error and material parameter uncertainty. By testing of prototypes, information on both uncertainties is obtained. Because of strength correlation in a series, sampling is considered non-random. The Bayesian Method is used to consider the problem of relating prior knowledge and test data to a prescribed characteristic value of the load carrying capacity, i.e., a prescribed fractile of the strength distribution, or a target value of a reliability index. Examples show application to prototype testing structural assemblies or parts. It is concluded that even a slight correlation may have a significant influence on the estimated strength.

AB - Reinforced concrete corners have inherently more flexural strength across the corner than at other sections when subjected to negative bending moments. The modes of failure and cracking characteristics of negative moment corners and the reliability of different conventional reinforcement arrangements at corners are studied. The results show that the cracked section moment capacity of the corners should be considered reliable. Channel shaped frame specimens, with and without initial flaws at the corners, are used in the study. Three types of reinforcement arrangements are investigated. Corner efficiency rating is obtained.

AB - The finite segment method is applied here to solve biaxially loaded reinforced concrete columns. The column is treated as a space structure after segmentation. The sections are divided into finite elements of steel and concrete in order to calculate its tangent stiffnesses properties at different levels of strain. The segment stiffness relationship is computed by solving the governing differential equations about the principal axes of the cross section. Direct stiffness method is utilized to construct the whole column stiffness matrix (master stiffness matrix). Nonlinearities due to material plasticity and geometrical change are handled by an iterative procedure based on the modified tangent stiffness approach. Comparisons of failure load and deflection with biaxially loaded reinforced concrete column tests show an excellent correlation between theory and test data.

AB - A dynamic axisymmetric finite element model suitable for shells of revolution founded on ring footings is presented. The model consists of high-precision rotational shell finite elements, representing the axisymmetric shell, supported on an equivalent boundary system, representing the soil medium. The substructure method is used to model the shell and soil components. In addition to the seismic analysis capability of the proposed model, it is also applicable to other dynamic loads such as wind. The dynamic behavior of a hyperboloidal cooling tower shell on discrete supports with a ring footing is studied. Dynamic properties are examined and stress analysis is carried out for a variety of soil conditions.

AB - The behavior of two reduced-scale concrete bridge decks subjected to simulated wheel loads was evaluated in a series of tests. One slab was reinforced in accordance with AASHTO requirements; the other had three areas with varying amounts of isotropic reinforcement. Results show that with either reinforcement pattern, service load bending moments are from 40 to 65 percent of those predicted by flexural theory. Failures were by punching shear rather than flexure and occurred at loads at least six times larger than design.

AB - Material properties (heterogeneity and non-linearity) and disturbing phenomena (slow crack growth and microcracking) cause several research workers to be pessimistic about the applicability of Fracture Mechanics to concrete structures. A critical review of the preceding works dealing with concrete fracture is presented. During the 1960's and 1970's it became more and more evident that notch sensitivity is not a material property but only a phenomenon dependent on the specimen and crack sizes, and that the degree of heterogeneity is only a matter of scale. A true fracture collapse can occur only with very large structures. On the other hand a real ultimate strength collapse can occur only with very small fracture specimens. Usually, with the sizes of the structures built by man and the lengths of the natural cracks, the two collapses are interacting.

These procedures essentially consist of simple and accurate repeated numerical integrations similar to the Newmark procedure for beams and beam-columns. Iterations are required for the large deflection and second order analyses. Axial strains and temperature effects are considered. The procedure gives high accuracy with few divisions, and computer solutions are inexpensive.

SO - Journal of the Structural Division 1982-04-01 108(4): 869-887
AB - The acrosswind response of buildings is investigated. Expressions for the acrosswind loading are developed through the use of the spatio-temporal measurement of the fluctuating pressure field around a square cross-section building model. Methods of random vibration theory are used to estimate the rms and peak values of displacement, acceleration and jerk components of response. The results are compared with the response of an aeroelastically modeled building. The predicted and measured response agree within the limits of expected experimental errors. The addition of motion induced loads at higher reduced velocities produces still closer agreement between the predicted and measured response. Important features of the measured response characteristics are summarized. A step-by-step procedure and numerical example are presented to illustrate the methodology outlined for predicting the response to be estimated at the preliminary design stages. This would allow early assessment of the requirement to resist the mean deflection and to reduce the acceleration level at the top floors, and to ensure structural safety and occupancy comfort.

SO - Journal of the Structural Division 1982-04-01 108(4): 888-909
AB - A new optimal design procedure, intended to reduce the number of exact analyses during the solution process, is proposed. High quality explicit approximations of the structural behaviour and a scaling procedure are combined to achieve this goal. Explicit behavior models are introduced for a set of lines (directios of move) in the design space. Some algorithms for selecting these lines are presented. For each checked design along a given line the structural behavior is evaluated. The design is then scaled. This procedure, which involves small computational effort, is repeated the various step sizes until the best constrained design is obtained. A new direction of move is selected and a modified approximate model is introduced. Each selected direction requires only a single exact analysis of the structure. The result is an efficient path to the optimum with a relatively small number of exact analyses. Simple examples illustrate the solution process, the quality and the efficiency of the explicit behavior model, and the potential of the proposed procedure.

AB - A brief review showed considerable differences in the quantity of rectangular hoops required by various seismic design codes in the potential plastic hinge regions of rectangular reinforced concrete columns. Tests conducted on four nearly full size reinforced concrete columns with a 550 mm (21.7 in) square cross section, various axial load levels, and various quantities of rectangular hoops, are described. The hoops were designed according to the recommendations of the draft New Zealand Concrete Design Code. The columns demonstrated very ductile behaviour when loaded by simulated seismic loading up to displacement ductility factors of at least 6, confirming the adequacy of the proposed design provisions. Considerable enhancement of flexural strength was observed over that calculated by normal code design procedures, but the enhancement could be accounted for a refined flexural strength analysis which included the effect of strain hardening of the longitudinal steel and the increase in strength and ductility of the confined concrete. Maximum compressive concrete strains in the range 0.016 to 0.026 were measured on the surface of the confined concrete core at the peak displacements.
