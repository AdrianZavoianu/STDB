AB - The first three natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes for fixed-base frame-wall systems are presented. The system is modelled as a continuum of uniform properties incorporating the shear deformation in the wall. The resulting fourth-order homogeneous differential equation in terms of lateral displacement is solved exactly using an appropriate numerical technique. The results are presented for various combinations of the two nondimensional parameters which together incorporate all the geometric and material properties of the frame-wall system. The mode shapes are presented in terms of the first three normal modes of a uniform slender cantilever. The nondimensional base shears appropriate for the response spectrum analysis of the system under seismic loading are also given.

AB - The conventional method of designing water tanks is irrational and leads to relatively thick walls with a substantial amount of reinforcement. Application of the limit state method results in considerable economy. The limit analysis used to find the strength of the structure is explained. Cost of the tank consisting of the tank wall and floor, which includes cost of concrete, reinforcement and formwork, is chosen as the objective function in the optimization problem formulation. The constrained nonlinear programming problem is solved using DFP algorithm. An example, solved in a textbook by the conventional method, is chosen to get an idea of the saving in the cost that can be obtained. It has been found that optimization coupled with limit state design results in significant reduction in the cost of the tank.

AB - Methods for assessing the seismic safety of a lifeline system are developed; with part of the study being devoted to the development of a relation between the earthquake intensity and the distance for near-source regions. The attenuation of maximum ground motion intensity with distance is examined. Specific attenuation relations are developed and compared with the existing empirical attenuation equations. On this basis, the importance of the source parameters are examined. With regard to the safety analysis of lifeline systems, it is assumed that earthquakes originate as ruptures along geologic faults. Two types of hazards from earthquakes are considered; namely, the hazard of a fault rupture strike on the links of a lifeline system, and the hazard of damage caused by severe ground shaking. The application of the methods presented herein are demonstrated for a specific lifeline system.

AB - The behavior of prestressed concrete beams with rectangular openings is investigated at transfer. The theoretical analysis for the potentially-splitting stresses around the opening is performed by the finite element method. The results are verified and substantiated by tests on eighteen post-tensioned concrete beams. Based on the results a simple method is developed to estimate and design for the vertical tension force at the opening. Effects of lateral prestressing around the opening as well as the presence of more than one opening are examined.

The cross section is partitioned into a number of small elemental areas of steel and concrete, and the moment-curvature-thrust relationships are obtained by step-by-step application of the force-deformation equilibrium equations subjected to different loading paths. Contour interaction equation is extended and verified for its applicability to composite sections.

Bridges of rectangular and skew planforms are studied. The elastic analysis is based on a Fourier series solution, while the ultimate load analysis is formulated using yield-line theory. The results from the theoretical analyses are compared to those from experiments on five 1/8-scale models of reinforced and prestressed waffle slab bridges. The serviceability and load-carrying capacity of reinforced versus prestressed waffle slab bridges are compared.

AB - Earthquakes in the eastern United States have longer recurrence times, less attenuation of damaging ground motion, and occur in more diffuse source zones than their western counterparts. As a consequence, hazard specification, either by deterministic or probabilistic techniques, is more uncertain in the East. Many of the eastern source zones in historic time have not had the largest earthquake of which they are capable. Two eastern source zones, the St. Lawrence valley of Canada and the New Madrid fault of the central Mississippi valley, produced great earthquakes (magnitude larger than 8). They probably are the only zones in the East which can generate such great earthquakes. A number of other zones, however, can produce major earthquakes which will affect a large number of people, because of the high density of population and the low attenuation of damaging ground motion in the East. All critical facilities should be designed to withstand the maximum expected ground shaking, even though it may have a long recurrence time, of the order of 1000 years.

AB - A new concept of aseismic design for steel framed buildings is proposed. By providing sliding friction devices in the bracing system of the framed buildings, their earthquake resistance and damage control potential can be considerably enhanced. During severe earthquake excitations, the friction device slips and a large portion of the vibrational energy is dissipated mechanically in friction rather than inelastic yielding of the main structural components. Results of inelastic time-history dynamic analysis show superior performance of the friction damped braced steel frames when compared to computed responses of other structural framing systems. The proposed friction devices act, in affect, both as safety valves and structural dampers. The device may also be conveniently incorporated in existing framed buildings to upgrade their earthquake resistance.

AB - The results of tests to destruction of twelve space trusses are reviewed. The results cover model tests of 3' to 8' span and larger scale tests of 24' and 31' span. The trusses are all double-layer plate-like space structures. Both aluminum and steel members, and welded, bolted or commercial (proprietary) jointing systems are used. Attention is drawn to the significance of factors not normally considered in the analysis and design of such structures. The effects of joint slip, initial force systems caused by lack of fit or welding, combined with the inherent scatter of peak load capacities of the brittle-type compressive elements, furnish reductions of the experimentally derived ultimate loads when compared with theoretical predictions. It appears that the greater the degree of indeterminacy the greater the theoretical overestimate of the experimental value. Load capacities between 3 and 37 percent below those expected were observed.

The panels were tested mainly under flexural and impact loading to determine the effect of the type and amount of reinforcement and the panel thickness on the strength and deformation characteristics. Roof panels reinforced with Nile reeds are proposed. A 20-year old house of stabilized earth with reed-reinforced gypsum floor and roof panels is described.

AB - A finite strip method is used for analysing the buckling of longitudinally stiffened web plates subjected to transverse local edge loading. The probLem is of particular importance for box girders, which have relatively weak flanges for resisting this type of buckling. Critical loads are obtained for square webs stiffened by single asymmetric longitudinal stiffeners positioned at one fifth of the depth from the loaded edge. A sufficient range of stiffener geometries is considered to enable the separate influences of the bending and torsional rigidities to be determined and two simple design rules are proposed. The first gives the lower limit on the bending rigidity for which the stiffener remains straight in the buckled configuration. The second gives the buckling strength of the web as a function of the torsional rigidty of the stiffener.

AB - The imperfection sensitivity of laced columns is investigated, the imperfection consisting of both a local and an overall geometrical imperfections. A simple numerical method is given and used for solving the linear elastic as well as the linear elastic-ideally plastic problem. The collapse load in the latter case is approximated with the load, initiating yielding in the structure. It is shown that the linear-elastic column, after reaching the collapse load, behaves almost like a shell and must, therefore, be expected to be sensitive to imperfections. It is shown that the relative drop in capacity of the linear elastic-ideal plastic column is largest when the two critical Euler stresses and the yield stress all coincide.

AB - The paper describes an analytical model for theoretically predicting the inelastic cyclic behavior of fix-ended steel beam-columns subjected to one cycle of axial loading. The analysis is based on the hinge-by-hinge method used widely in the study of elastic-plastic behavior of steel structures. In this analysis, the solution of an elastic-plastic beam-column under cyclic and reversed loading is obtained as a sequence of elastic column solutions which follow the history of loading. Using this analytical procedure, closed form expressions are derived for axially loaded beam-columns with constant lateral loads. With these expressions, extensive numerical solutions are presented. Some of the results are compared with available tests on actual tubular beam-columns, providing the needed confirmation of the validity of the simple analytical model for practical use.

AB - The resistance to crack growth in mortar, concrete and fiber reinforced concrete was studied by testing double torsion and double cantilever speciments. R-curves (plots of strain energy release rate vs. crack extension) were obtained from the test data. To include the inelastic strain energy absorbed during the crack extension, the definition of the strain energy release rate was modified. It was found that R-curves for mortar and concrete were similar for both double torsion and double cantilever speciments. R-curves were sensitive to the volume and size of aggregates and to the presence of fibers. It appears that R-curves can be a useful specimen-geometry-independent parameter for chracterizing the fracture behavior of cementitious composites. However, the effects of differing crack-opening displacement on the strain energy release rate must be considered; especially for fiber reinforced concrete.

AB - Composite masonry walls (walls built of brick and concrete masonry units bonded so as to exert common action under load) have been used for decades. Until recently, the only method of sizing composite masonry walls was an empirical one using ANSI A41.1 Now, with the completion of ACI-531, there is a rational method available. This standard is actually a concrete masonry standard, but it includes a chapter on composite masonry. The ASCE/ACI 530 Joint Committee on Masonry is currently developing a new design standard for masonry of all products, including composite masonry. This paper presents a short history of past research and gives suggestions for needed research in the area of composite masonry.

AB - The dynamic response of a tall reinforced-concrete hyperbolic cooling tower which has been designed for vertically incident seismic waves, based on a linear analysis, is examined for horizontally propagating waves of the same amplitude. The nonlinear response is also calculated, taking the material law of the reinforcing steel and of the concrete in the columns as well as lift-off and slipping of the separate foundations into account. The global response is increased for retrograde waves and decreased for prograde waves. It is decreased in a nonlinear analysis for both types of waves. The local response is increased for retrograde and prograde waves and is in all cases larger in a nonlinear analysis than in the corresponding linear one. When checking the seismic response of the retrograde wave in a nonlinear analysis with the design determined for vertical incidence, the following applies: The foundations have to be strengthened, the reinforcement of the columns is unaffected, but its area would possibly have to be increased, and the reinforcement in the lower part of the shell is sufficient.
