AB - A method is presented to analyze the load-deflection behavior of liner anchorage systems used in the design and construction of steel-lined concrete containment structures in nuclear power plants. The PAFEC 75 computer program with its bilinear stress-strain capability produced analytically similar results to those measured in anchorage tests conducted at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Three different analyses were made. Two of these were variations in the angle anchorage system and the third was an analysis of a structural tee. In large measure, crushing of the concrete occurs as the load approaches the maximum peak. Rough approximations of the results of concrete crushing were made by successive analyses where selected elements of the concrete mesh were eliminated. The eliminated elements were those that first reached strains where crushing of the concrete could occur. This analytical approach gave conservative results compared to the data.

AB - Little attention has heretofore been paid to the strength of welded thin-web columns. The purpose of this research was to determine what factors affected the strength of this type of column. An initial literature search defined the range of testing necessary to provide pertinent data on column strength. Seven columns ranging from 9° (22.9 cm) to 24° (61 cm) deep were used in the testing program. Prior to testing, all columns were measured for residual stress distributions. Stub-columns and long column tests were performed on the 9 inch (22.9 cm) and 12 inch (30.5 cm) deep columns. It was found that residual stresses were larger than those found in either thick-wall welded or rolled sections. The columns were generally stronger in axial compression than would have been predicted by various widely used column curves. This is accounted for, in part, by the straightness of the columns tested and by partial end rotation restraint. However, proposed column design curves may unduly penalize columns of this type. Weld amperage and preparation of edges had relatively small effect on the residual stress pattern and column strength.

AB - The growing need for a unified approach to structural design for different construction materials and technologies is met by the limit states design approach. Several standards-writing committees currently are considering how best to implement practical limit states design criteria. This paper examines the relative advantages of several approaches proposed for this purpose, with regard to their ability to provide desired levels of reliability for all probable design situations. The choice of an appropriate approach is found to depend on fundamental characteristics of structural behavior, and thus might not be the same for different construction materials.

AB - Results from a duration of load experiment on western hemlock 2 × 6-inch lumber, visually graded No. 2 and better, are presented. Constant and ramp loadings arm used and, to predict load duration behavior for other load histories, a damage accumulation model is developed and calibrated to the test results. The implications of the test and the damage model for the assessment of reliability of wood structures are discussed. The model's predictions are verified using additional test results from a rate-of-loading experiment with media-times-to-failure in the range 0.04 seconds to 11.3 hours.

AB - The strength of series-produced or mass produced structures is often correlated because of workmanship or material strength correlation (e.g., steel from the same heat or lumber from similar species grown in the same region). A model of correlation is used to select load factors in design based on prototype testing so as to yield structures with a prescribed reliability. Correlation is usually disregarded in practice. It is found, however, that the correlation in structural resistance is significant and can produce important savings if taken into account. This is illustrated in the design example of an industrial building. In this example the best strategy is to test only one prototype, in agreement with common practice.

AB - The fatigue crack propagation behavior of two types of fillet welded specimens is investigated and the application of fracture mechanics for the prediction of fatigue life is discussed. Small scale fillet welded stiffener and gusset specimens were tested under constant amplitude stress cycles. The crack propagation behavior is estimated from dye-markings on the fatigue fracture surface. The dye penetrant technique permits a crack depth of as small as 0.1 to 0.2 mm to be visibly marked. Along the fillet weld toes of the stiffener specimens, single or multiple cracks, 0.47 to 0.6 mm deep, could be dye-marked, after about 30% of the fatigue life. Cracks could be marked even earlier in the gusset specimens due to a higher stress concentration. Applying the method of fracture mechanics, the fatigue behavior of these dye-marked specimens are analysed. Measured crack shapes and fillet weld toe geometries are taken into account. The computer fatigue life is in good agreement with the test results.

AB - In the design of steel building frames, various simplifying assumptions are usually introduced when determining member design forces. Typically, the beams are assumed to be either rigidly connected to the columns or simply supported. However, neither of these conditions is ever realized in actual frames. This paper describes the effects of connection flexibility on beam behavior; a parametric study is described for a family of 32 typical multistory frames representing several design philosophies. The study evaluates the adequacy of preliminary design methods for predicting both member forces and building drifts by comparing these parameters with those obtained from a linear elastic computer analysis which accounts for actual connection flexibility. Example results are shown indicating potential savings of steel from use of refined analytical methods.

Predictions using the model are compared with test results and good agreement is shown. The model includes the lateral and torsional deformation of the joists as degrees of freedom, and this permits the consideration of the effect that joist bridging has on the maximum floor deflection and the maximum bending stressed. In another application, the response of floors under uniformly distributed ad is simulated for different levels of within-fLoor variability in the elastic properties for the joists.

AB - This paper describes the application of an analytical method for estimating structures at an intermediate distance from a fault; the method is based on fault dislocation and surface wave theory. For illustration, a potential large earthquake which may occur along the southern portion of the San Andreas fault in California is considered. The prototype event assumed is the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. As a site, Long Beach is chosen. Long-period ground motions due to Love waves and their response spectra are calculated for various fault rupture and crustal models. Sloshing wave heights in a large tank during the earthquake are also estimated. The results obtained indicate that: (1) the average velocity response spectra of ground motions with 5% critical damping are nearly uniform (30 to 40 cm/sec) over the period range from 6 to 14 sec; (2) sloshing wave height in a large tank is about 70 cm and may reach 2 m under certain circumstances; (3) the freeboard height specified in current aseismic design appears to be inadequate for sloshing waves produced by a large earthquake. The example discussed herein is just one of a number of potentially important applications of the theory.

AB - This paper addresses some of the questions facing the engineer who is charged with assessing the safety of concrete structures for which conventional linear analysis is deemed inadequate. The currently available material models are reviewed and discussed under the viewpoint of applicability in engineering practice. Guidelines are given to aid the engineer in selecting the material model most appropriate for this purpose. Questions related to finite element analysis are discussed, including numerical solution techniques, their accuracy, efficiency and applicability. Also considered is the practical significance of solution sensitivity, reliability and cost. An example of a prestressed concrete reactor vessel illustrates the application of nonlinear finite element analysis to concrete structures in engineering practice.

AB - The effect of an initial out-of-straightness on the buckling strength of a single-crossarm stayed column is investigated. A geometrical study of the stayed column is used to determine the relationship between the applied load, lateral deflection and the tension in the stays. The geometrical nonlinear behaviour is included in the analysis by using the finite element method and a mixed incremental and iterative procedure. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the influence of varying the stayed column parameters on the buckling load, deflection rate, as well as the minimum effective, optimum and maximum possible pretensions. Experimental results obtained from a single-crossarm stayed colum with various initial pretensions in the stays are presented and compared with theoretical results, and good agreement was obtained. The results indicate that the presence of an initial out-of-straightness changes the deflection rate and can significantly reduce the buckling load.

A brief description of a beam model and solution technique are given. It is shown that if a cantilever tube is loaded laterally under non-uniform shear, a reversal of the shear lag distribution may occur at some point in the beam; the centerline stress may exceed the edge stress. Although the practical significance is not clear, further study is encouraged to explain the phenomenon and explore its significance.

A method to extend the theory to cables with inclined chords is to view the cable in a coordinate system inclined with the chord. A modified linear analysis for inclined slack cables is suggested.

AB - There are two principal disadvantages in the use of multiple column curves as they are currently formulated. First, they are represented either by equations which are cumbersome to use or by tables with a new table for each column curve. Second, the change from one column curve to another is a large step change so that it may be difficult to decide which curve should represent some sections and it is possible for anomalies to arise. These two disadvantages are removed in the proposed method, in which the three SSRC curves are represented by a single curve and a single linear modifying function. The modifying function has been chosen to allow smooth transitions between the existing SSRC curves and to make step changes between the curves unnecessary.

AB - This technical note presents estimates of the extent to which thermal convection effects cause mean wind profiles to deviate from the logarithmic law. It is shown that the deviations from the logarithmic law are significant for wind speeds corresponding to hourly means of the order of 5 m/s above ground in open terrain. However, for strong wind speeds of interest in structural engineering calculations (≥70 mph), these deviations are of the order of 4% or less at 200 m above ground, and 1% at 50 m above ground, and thus may be neglected in practice. For strong wind speeds of interest in extreme wind climatological estimates (≥30 mph), the deviations are of the order of 4% or less at 15 m above ground, and therefore are also negligible for practical purposes.
