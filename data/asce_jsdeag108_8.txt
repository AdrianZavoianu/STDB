AB - The effect of meridional imperfection in hyperbolic cooling towers is studied in a continuation of an earlier study by the writers; the present paper takes into account the parallel work performed by Croll, et al. In the previous study the writers assumed the meridional shape of imperfection as the combination of two straight lines. Croll, et al considered the shape to be a combination of circular arcs. In the present study, a general shape is assumed, which becomes the straight line or the circular shape as two extremes depending on the value of a parameter 'C'. Simple expressions for the maximum possible imperfection hoop force and meridional moments are obtained. It is proposed that imperfection stresses be considered explicitly in the design of cooling towers. These stresses can be calculated on the basis of the maximum allowable construction tolerances. The writers suggest further professional discussion to decide whether the designer can lower the apparent factor of safety when the imperfection stresses are explicitly accounted for.

AB - An approach for the ultimate limit state design of steel buildings against the credible severest earthquake is presented on the basis of energy concept. The safety of a structure is judged by comparing structure's energy dissipating capacity with earthquake input energy to the structure. A general safety criterion is first developed for a simple elasto-plastic shear-type system, and then a procedure is discussed in detail to relate the strength and deformation capacity of steel members to those of the dynamically equivalent elasto-plastic system.

AB - A systematic procedure is proposed for the design of prestressed concrete tensile members. The design criteria considered include maximum allowable compression, ultimate strength, safety against cracking, safety against decompression, minimum reinforcement and maximum instantaneous and long-term deformations. Each design criterion is expressed in function of two unknown variables that are the area of the prestressing steel and the cross sectional area of concrete. It is shown that the relationships representing the various criteria form a feasibility domain bound mostly by linear functions. Using an acceptable design approximation the problem is linearized and reduced to a linear programming problem in which the objective function is to minimize the cost and/or the weight of the member. The geometric solution is explained and recommended for the purpose of design. An example is developed to illustrate the procedure.

AB - A plastic method of design of rectangular slabs based on lower bound solutions of collapse has been developed. The slab is divided into middle and end zones so as to reinforce for beam action in the middle zone and for slab action in the end zones. Earlier developed lower bound limit analysis solutions for rectangular slabs are made compatible with the assumed mode of collapse. Expressions are presented for the plastic moment capacities to be provided in the x and y-directions in the end and middle zones of all the nine possible slab types with combinations of simply supported and fixed edge conditions. Two design illustrations demonstrate the rationale in the application of the method.

AB - The lateral torsional buckling behavior of I beams with tension flange restraint is described. Tension flange restraint occurs frequently in continuous beams and indeterminate structures. A theoretical derivation of the buckling capacity of these beams is described, and the results are compared to other well known solutions. The theory predicts a significant increase in buckling capacity with tension flange restraint when the St. Venant torsional stiffness is large. An experimental setup is designed and tests are performed to verify the theory and to further substantiate the increased moment capacity. Finally, equations which can be used in the design of beams with tension flange restraint are presented. The results of this work show the importance of tension flange restraint in limiting or controlling buckling.

AB - An alternate method for the design of prestressed concrete flexural members using the service load criteria is presented. The method differs from other available methods, in the sense that no preliminary estimation of the prestressing force or sectional dimensions is necessary, and the range of prestress is determined prior to determining the cross-sectional dimensions or section modulus. However, the use of the design equations requires a preliminary assumption of eccentricity ratio. The method can be adopted for design of both fully stressed and non-fully stressed sections, and is applicable for pretensioned as well as post-tensioned sections. The method of construction of interaction diagrams is shown which can be used to determine the range of eccentricity in non-fully stressed sections. Different equations are derived for different types of cross sections for estimation of their thickness or section modulus.

The cables are represented by beam segments which are initially straight between modes; a bilinear constitutive equation is used and changing geometry is accomodated. An example is included. Applications to the pheneomenon of thermo-mechanical bending are covered.

A parametric study is carried out to show the effects of the dimensionless parameters of the foundation on the transmissibilities of the structure due to harmonic ground motion. The characteristics of an optimal base isolation are discussed and results are presented in a form which may be of use in preliminary designs.

AB - Natural modes and frequencies of a simple span suspension bridge with straight backstays are investigated, theoretically and experimentally. Fourier series representations of cable displacements are used in conjunction with the Lagrange method to represent the system with a small number of degrees-of-freedom. Bridge system matrices are derived which take account of cable, gravity, bending, and torsional stiffnesses. Natural modes and frequencies are obtained as the eigensolutions of small order system matrices. A numerical example is given from which approximate frequency formulas are derived. Experimental results in the form of frequency response curves, are presented for a laboratory model. Agreement between theory and test is within 5 percent or better.

AB - Tensegric shells are composed of cable or membrane envelopes prestressed by lengthening properly arranged bars connected at both of their ends to the envelope and not touching each other. The prestressing stabilizes the shell and induces tensile forces in the envelope and compression in the bars. The tensegric shells do not comprise a continuous rigid supporting element. The advantage of using tensegric shells for temporary and permanent structure is due to their easy assembly and erection. The nature of the bar arrangement in tensegric shells is shown. The stability criteria of a tensegric shell are formulated, and the effect of prestressing the envelope by lengthening some of the bars is examined. The analysis of the shell geometrical distortion due to prestressing is formulated. The effect of external load applied to the structure is investigated. It is shown that the effect of external load on the geometrical configuration of the shell depends on the type of the shell. External load applied to some types of shell causes too large geometrical distortion, whereas the distortion of other types is due to the elasticity of its members only. Different types of tensegric shells are analyzed as numerical examples.

AB - Results of an experimental investigation to determine the inelastic dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete coupled wall systems under severe earthquake motions are reported. These tests show that the natural frequencies of reinforced concrete structures are reduced to as much as 50% of the initial uncracked values during the first few seconds of a strong earthquake, additional reductions in the natural frequencies are not as significant as those caused by the first shock even if the aftershocks are significantly stronger than the first one, the size, strength, and ductility of the coupling beams are the controlling factors in the mode of failure of coupled wall systems, and although the test structures were subjected to severe inelastic behavior, some characteristics, such as modal shapes, nodal points, and amplification (filtering) along the height of the structure were similar to those of linear elastic systems.

The displacement transformation matrix, which allows the beam element to be incorporated into a general frameworks program is then formulated, after which the treatment of distributed loading is described. The accuracy and correctness of the stiffness and transformation matrices are verified by comparison with a range of convergent solutions obtained from subdivision of the curved members into a number of straight segments.

AB - Nonlinear analysis of concrete structures using finite elements is discussed. The applications include a thick-walled top-closure for a pressure vessel as well as the delicate problems of beams failing in shear. The top-closure analysis evaluates the effect of two different failure criteria and modeling of a realistic post-failure behavior is demonstrated to be mandatory for accurate structural predictions. For shear beams it is shown that the primary cause of failure is strain softening adjacent to the load point. This softening causes a strain localization which in turn results in a tendency toward diagonal cracking. Stirrups prevent this tendency and a shear-compression failure follows. Otherwise, a diagonal tension failure results. This again highlights modeling of strain softening. The influence of the shear retention factor is found to be relatively moderate. Variation of the uniaxial tensile strength influences the results insignificantly. Modeling of secondary cracks is found to be essential. Finally, it is shown that dowel action must be treated through the bending of the bars and not through their shear deformation.

Such a classification may be selected, if secondary members are considered in the design. In order to illustrate such effects, a two girder system is examined, with and without bottom lateral bracing. One girder is considered in a cracked and uncracked flange condition. The preliminary results show the effect bracing has on the load redistribution.

AB - Roof failures due to snow loads are often the result of heavy drifts rather than uniform snow loads. Codes and standards such as Standard A58.1 of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the National Building Code of Canada contain procedures for estimating snow loads on basic structures only. An understanding of elementary fluid mechanics and snow accumulation phenomena allows a designer to predict regions of potentially heavy snow loading in situations not covered by the codes. Several basic principles are presented and illustrated by examples of air flow around commonly shaped structures and the regions of snow accumulation. Modeling of snow drifting supplies qualitative information on snow accumulation in complex situations; advantages and limitations are examined.
