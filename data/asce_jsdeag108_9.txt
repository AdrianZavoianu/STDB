AB - Some deficiencies in structual welding, particularly when thousands of welds are installed, are expected. This deficiency may or may not compromise the strength of the joint or the structural element. A deterministic evaluation of this deficiency may not be possible. A probabilistic procedure is suggested. Limited sampling information from the site is used to develop this methodology. Sampling information obtained from a project should be checked before the information is used for any statistical prediction. The χ2 test of homogeneity could be used to check the homogeneity of the samples. The hyperbinomial distribution may be the most appropriate distribution to study the characteristics of a group of welds. It considers the effect of sample size on the prediction. A large sample size is always beneficial, but the cost-benefit ratio for the collection of samples should be studied before any decisions are made. The method suggested here would help to study this area. Repairing the welds, whenever necessary, is the final step. This method is a safe, economical and conservative solution to this complex problem.

AB - The power spectral density (PSD) of road surface roughness on highway bridges is presented. Eighty-four lines of 56 bridges were measured and the road surface roughness was measured by surveyor's level. The PSD is assumed by a stationary normal probability process with a zero mean value, and is calculated by a maximum entropy method (MEM) to a measured value of road surface roughness. Numerical examples are presented to obtain the information of road surface roughness on bridges in spectral characteristics, and to give the appropriate PSD using the dynamic response analysis of bridges under moving vehicles.

AB - The feasibility of probability-based design procedures for electrical transmission lines is discussed. Single pole structures have been selected in this initial study because of their simplicity as well as the lack of consistency in their design procedures. For the reliability analysis of a line, the paper emphasizes the design point, or advanced mean value second order method. All equations needed for a design point analysis are presented. These equations were implemented in the reliability program PAPOLE. The computer program can perform a reliability or design point analysis for a line consisting of poles with random properties and the line can be subjected to random wind and ice loads. Any probability distribution can be prescribed for the variables. Sample reliability analyses are presented. It is shown how reliability analyses of existing lines can be used to calibrate new proposed design procedures. A design procedure based on the (LRFD) Load Resistance Factor Design format is recommended.

AB - Computer oriented and manual procedures are presented that enable a direct second order analysis of asymmetric building structures to be performed by means of first order formulation. This is achieved by modeling the geometric-stiffness of the structure as a fictitious column with negative lateral and torsional stiffness properties. Simplified methods are proposed for structures amenable to some form of uncoupling. The approach is also applied to elastic-plastic analysis of asymmetric structures by combining center-of-rigidity and sway-subassemblage procedures. A numerical example is provided.

AB - An extensive finite-element parametric study developed a chart giving lateral-distribution factors for the fatigue design of steel highway bridges. The chart gives conservative upper-limit factors for interior and exterior beams. The factor for interior beams is 0.5. The factor for exterior beams varies with the distance from the beam to the outer traffic lane and reaches a value of 0.9 when the center of the lane is directly over the beam. These upper-limit values can be used to make an initial fatigue check. If this check is satisfactory, as it would be in many cases, no further check is required. Otherwise, a second check can be made by using a more precise criterion that depends on the beam span and moment of inertia. The factors from the chart are generally much less than the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) factors. Lateral-distribution factors were calculated from field measurements on 21 steel bridges. The factors ranged from 0.20–0.52 and were in good agreement with factors from the lateral-distribution chart.

AB - Theoretical and experimental information is presented on impact factors for the fatigue design of steel highway bridges. Theoretical studies suggest that the impact factors for individual trucks in actual traffic should generally be less than 0.25, but that much higher factors would occur occasionally due to unusual conditions, such as a bump at a critical location. Measurement of impact factors in actual steel bridges confirms these theoretical conclusions. Impact factors approaching 100 percent have been reported in studies aimed at determining peak impact factors for nonfatigue design. However, impact factors determined for individual trucks in traffic, or for test trucks, are generally much lower. This suggests that the impact factors given by the present American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) formula are representative of actual bridge loading and, therefore, are generally appropriate for fatigue design, which should be based on typical, rather than extreme, conditions.

AB - Footbridges vibrate because the forces imparted by the user are applied with the frequency of the pace and movement, however small, is therefore a forced vibration. In instances where the pace coincides with a structure resonant frequency dynamic movement can be quite large and the user may be disturbed or even alarmed. Vibration is recognized as a serviceability limit state and a process that can be employed as a design tool permitting an early assessment of behavior is proposed. The subject is investigated in terms of the pedestrian excitation source, the structure response, and acceptance criteria. Calculated response compares favorably with test results. Remedial or preventative options in the form of various damping devices are reviewed.

AB - Primary concerns in the design of high-rise buildings, particularly those located in seismically active regions, are the control of interstory drift and the ability of the structure to withstand inelastic deformations. The design of the 47 story 4 Embarcadero Center building in San Francisco, California, utilizes a recently developed structural system that provides economical control of interstory drift, as well as sufficient ductility to enable the structure to perform satisfactorily in the event of a major earthquake. The use of eccentric bracing elements is the key to this structural system. This paper describes how an eccentric bracing scheme was used to satisfy the requirements for both drift control and ductility in the design of a high-rise structure located in a zone of high seismic exposure.

AB - The finite element method (FEM) is used to model the behavior of rectangular hollow section (RHS) T-joints beyond the elastic limit, and is applied to determine their ultimate and working strengths. Punching shear and rotational stiffnesses under branch axial force and bending moment have also been calculated. The unreinforced and haunch type joints were analyzed in the study. In both cases the chord top flange was modelled as a thin plate supported by coupled edge springs. Loading was incorporated through line loads along the perimeter of a rigid inclusion (the branch). In the elastic range, joint stiffness values were found to be in good agreement with the available test results. The sensitivity of joints to different geometric parameters, i.e., width ratio λ, haunch size λ1, and chord thickness t was studied using the FEM model in the elastic-plastic range. Ultimate branch moments or punching shear forces were found to be about five times the corresponding first yield values, thus indicating the need to base design loads on an ultimate strength or maximum deflection criterion.

AB - An approximate method for determining the elastic flexural-torsional buckling loads of laterally continuous structures is developed. The method can be applied to structures loaded at braced points. The braces and supports are assumed to prevent lateral deflection and twisting. The procedure locates a critical segment and adjacent restraining segments which together form a subassemblage. The elastic critical load is obtained by determining the effective length of the critical segment. Charts of effective length factors are presented and the factors are shown to depend on the amount of end restraint and on the critical segment beam parameter and end moment ratio. The proposed method is applied to a worked example. The result, along with other results presented in the paper, is in close agreement with accurate numerical solutions.

AB - A report of fatigue tests on tensile loaded bolted connections is presented. The tests clearly demonstrate that the structural design is of major importance with regard to the fatigue strength of such connections. By designing connections which are structurally well-detailed, it is possible to entirely eliminate bolt fatigue in tension, while in that case an elaborate analysis of the fatigue strength of the bolts can be eliminated.
