AB - The determination of wind forces on a structure is basically a dynamic problem. However, it has been conventional practice to treat such forces as static loads. This approach is satisfactory provided that the relationship between the time variation of the wind and the natural frequencies of the structure is such as to cause an essentially static response. This paper is devoted to that portion of the problem involving structures which respond dynamically to the imposed wind forces.

AB - The analysis of bending of finite beams on elastic foundation, under the action of an arbitrary distribution of lateral loads, is accomplished by an iterative procedure analogous to the H. Cross method for the analysis of continuous beams and structural frames. Very short beams may be considered as rigid with respect to the foundation. Approximate equations are derived for the direct computation of deflection and stress for beams ranging from long to moderately shot with respect to the “characteristic length” of the system of the beam and the foundation.

Included is a series of tables from the Swiss Building Code which is the latest and most extensive data published. It is hoped this paper will assist the civil engineer in establishing more logical design criteria for proper economy and safety in structures.

AB - The design procedure presented in this paper involves the strength of a short column, the eccentricity determined from an elastic analysis, and a reduction coefficient. Depending on the method used in computing the short column strength, the procedure may be applied at either working or ultimate load level. The reduction coefficient is based on the results of a theoretical analysis of the strength of long columns. It is shown that the strength of a hinged column with the eccentricity obtained from an elastic analysis represents a lower limit for the strength of restrained columns. It is shown further that the ratio of the strength of a long column to that of a short column depends primarily on the slenderness ratio and on the ratio of end eccentricities. These two variables are taken into account in the reduction coefficient. The design procedure is compared with the available test data for hinged columns.

Large size and scale model brick walls were tested without bounding frames, and with reinforced concrete or structural steel frames. Some approximate relationships are suggested as a means of predicting the behavior of such walls.

AB - Recent research efforts utilizing high-speed digital computers and electric analogs have indicated vast differences between design and code values for structures and their actual earthquake shears and behavior. This paper attempts to reconcile these differences with the aid of comprehensive structural and dynamic analyses and research efforts on two office buildings–one the traditional filler-wall type and the other a modern glass-wall structure. Included are strengths, rigidities, and energy-absorption values for the former building under various distortions up to failure and also the results of a comprehensive series of analog tests for the modern 20-story structure using four complete earthquake records with 16 various systems of damping and rigidity values. Certain inconsistencies and pitfalls in present-day design practice are demonstrated and new considerations are suggested for resisting the occasional but extreme energy releases of Nature.
