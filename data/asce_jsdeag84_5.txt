AB - The behavior and properties of concrete structures for shielding atomic power plants are discussed briefly. Methods are presented for estimating thermal effects associated with linear and non-linear distributions of temperature, nuclear heating, and shield cooling. These data and procedures are subsequently used for analyzing several design problems and thermal criteria.

AB - A study of the helicoidal girder, fixed at the ends, subtending a horizontal angle of 180 degrees, and having a slope of 30 degrees is presented. Four girders, each having a different uniform rectangular cross-section throughout its length, are investigated. The determination of influence lines for end reactions due to vertical load is illustrated using analytical and experimental methods and final results are presented in tabulated and graphical form. End reactions under uniform load over half and full span are also given. The effect of width-depth ratio of cross-section on end reactions and internal forces is discussed.

AB - The paper presents a numerical solution for the influence ordinates of the horizontal reaction in a two-hinged arch of variable section. The procedure consists of the application of Newmark's numerical method for the integration of the terms in the horizontal reaction obtained by the conventional theory of consistent deformation. The entire operation can be carried out in a compact tabulation most suitable for design offices.

AB - The analysis and results of a study of the impact on highway bridges is described. The analysis was made on the IBM 704 high speed digital computer. The programming of this analysis was done by means of Fortran, an automatic coding system written in language closely resembling ordinary mathematical language and specially designed for engineering work. The effect of different bridge and truck characteristics are presented, and a dimensionless representation of all the variables.

AB - Wood in timber structures frequently gives long service life in its natural state, without any special protection. Under many service conditions, however, wood is attacked by deteriorating agencies that limit its useful life. A thorough understanding of the deteriorating agencies and the conditions that favor their development makes it possible to protect wood so that it will give long service life even under severe exposures.

AB - An analytical method is developed for the calculation of moments at the supports or joints of rigid frames by replacing a portion of a structure with a member of its equivalent in stiffness or in rigidity. The derivation of formulas in this pape is based on the concept that when a member continuous over several supports or rigid joints is cut at any of its supports or joints the equilibrium of the two portions of the member is unaltered if the slope at the section is preserved. Thus either its left or its right portion can be replaced by any such torsion or flexure member that fulfills this requirements. This facilitates the transformation of a complicated plane or space frame into a much simpler type of plane structures for analysis.

AB - A general procedure for the analysis of continuous beams subjected to transverse loads, applied couples, displacement of supports, and change in volume is presented. The depth of the beam may be constant or variable and the continuity may be interrupted by a mechanical hinge. The recommended procedure is a successive approximation which may be carried out to a desired degree of accuracy. The possibility of computing the moments at supports by means of infinite series is demonstrated. One starting value is computed at each support, and the continuity of the elastic curve is established by means of carry-over factors only. Tables especially suitable for the analysis of continuous welded, reinforced, or prestressed concrete girders of constant or variable depth are enclosed. Numerical examples are also included.
