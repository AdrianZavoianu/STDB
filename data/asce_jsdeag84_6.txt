AB - Two numerical methods for the solution of the problem of the interconnected bridge girder are considered for the particular case involving infinite torsional rigidity of the main longitudinal members. Formulas are developed for both deflection and moment for a two girder and four girder structure, and results from both cases are compared with those obtained by using rigorous formulas. Tables are included to compare solutions for various values of relative stiffness. The possibility of replacing the entire cross framing by a single center diaphragm for analysis pruposes is clearly indicated.

AB - The records of bridge movement obtained over a period of years by means of instruments at ten locations on the main and side spans of the Golden Gate Bridge are analyzed. They are plotted against wind velocity and correlated with theoretical analyses of wave form and against model test indications of the response to winds of different velocities. It is shown that the oscillations are almost always in a symmetric mode with the amplitude inhibited by the sharply downward deflection of the prevailing west wind as it passes over a high hill before striking the north side span. It is shown that during one forty minute period the oscillation was in an asymmetric torsional mode, uninhibited, and reached amplitudes predicted from the model tests. A bottom lateral system has been installed. Tests indicate that it will prevent a reoccurrence of the objectionable torsional motion.
