AB - In this paper the writer presents some conclusions from his study of the collapse of the Second Narrows Bridge in Vancouver, B.C. in the summer of 1958. He sees in this tragic occurrence not only a mere consequence of an error in design but also a manifestation of the effects of some factors not yet fully appreciated. Realization of their true signifiance may be one positive aspect of the disaster.

AB - Inclined chord bents with members of variable section are analyzed by means of modified moment-distribution procedure in which equilibrium between internal forces in chord members and external forces is maintained throughout entire distribution operation; solution is obtained directly with aid of relatively simple expressions for fixed-end moments, stiffnesses and carryover factors.
