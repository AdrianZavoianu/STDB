AB - Rivets and high strength bolts were used as fasteners for steel structures; clamping force was most important variable governing fatigue strength of joints; in riveted joints, variations of clamping force subordinated whatever superiority one steel had over another; joints with high strength bolts show much higher fatigue strength than riveted joints.

AB - Tests on joints with drilled and with misaligned punched holes, both with mill scale and with painted faying surfaces showed that punching of holes does, but misalignment and paint do not, affect significantly efficiency of joint; effect of punching of holes proved to be same for bolted as for riveted holes.
