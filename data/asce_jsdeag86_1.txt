AB - These gridworks are found in practice in bridge and roof structures; equations presented were derived to solve problem of prestressed concrete deck, 177 by 177 ft, with beams spaced 10.8 ft apart in each direction and supported by eight columns located in perimeter of deck; equations have been derived by slope-deflection-gyration method, where torsional stiffness as well as flexure stiffness of gridwork bars are taken into account.

AB - The summary briefly outlines the administrative setup of the Column Research Council which was organized in 1944. The work of the Council in reviewing world literature on metal compression members is reviewed. The summary shows how the various objectives of the Column Research Council, as originally framed, have been met during the past 15 years. The summary closes with a brief discussion of the current emphasis of Column Research Council, namely, the relation between theoretical analysis and design.

AB - Simplified procedure for analysis of symmetrical two, three, and four-span continuous girder bridges with variable moment of inertia; method consists of substituting values related to bridge dimensions, proportions and loadings, into formulas giving magnitudes of redundants without necessity of sign convention; all constants, coefficients, and functions are made dimensionless so that any consistent system of dimensions may be used.
