AB - Program of Fire Research Center of Portland Cement Assn comprises two separate parts; tests with large furnaces and small-scale research on concrete and steel at high temperatures; 40 ft long, 6 ft wide beam-testing furnace is connected with control room for recording temperatures, strains, deflections, and loads; it is concluded that prestressed concrete can be produced to have any reasonably required fire endurance period.

AB - Actual and theoretical behavior and effect of skew angle of bridge and torsional stiffness of girders are assessed; it was found that neutral planes of girders are neither coplanar nor stationary and this phenomenon is explained by induced distributed longitudinal forces in slab; description of test models; test results and instrumentation used.

AB - Results of tests of light gage steel roof and floor diaphragms; diaphragms with proper welding resist large horizontal loads, to extent that need for horizontal bracing systems in building is largely eliminated; deflection of light gage steel panel shear diaphragms must be considered to avoid damage to walls; however, in tests of many types of building panels, actual deflection was small fraction of that allowed under present specifications.

AB - Support by two parallel boundaries, each composed of two semi-infinite straight lines meeting at right angles uniformly loaded, is considered; bending and twisting moments and shears and boundary reactions in plate are determined by finite-difference integration of corresponding boundary value problem; penetration into side strips of disturbance represented by corner is negligible at distance from inner corner of order of width of side strips.
