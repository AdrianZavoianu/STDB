AB - Methods of direct moment distribution applied to the rigid frame bridges with inclined legs are introduced in this paper. Formulas are derived for the anti-symmetric loading conditions. By using these formulas with the aid of the tables that are provided, a simplified method for influence line analysis is introduced.

AB - Shear, bending, rocking and translational periods of cantilever beams with linearly varying shear and flexural rigidities, and with or without concentrated mass at their top, are computed and combined to obtain formula for approximate evaluation of periods of framed buildings; it is suggested that more accurate formula based on present results, be adopted in codes to improve reliability of earthquake analysis.

AB - The joint committee was organized in 1956 to prepare recommendations for the design and construction of structures composed of prefabricated beams combined with cast-in-place slabs. After a review of the existing information and practices, the committee has channeled one part of its activities toward preparation of recommendations for the design of composite beams and girders for buildings. The results of this work are reported herein.
