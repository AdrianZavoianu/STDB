AB - This paper presents the results of an analytical investigation involving a single mass system that has an idealized elasto-plastic resistance deformation relationship and that is subjected to the ground motion measured by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey during the May 1940 E1 Centro earthquake. The Basic parameters that are varied in this investigation are the natural period, ultimate strength, and damping of the system. All results are presented during the simulated earthquake input plotted against natural period for various combinations of ultimate strength and damping.
