AB - For massive structures of gravity dams, dead load stresses form most important fraction of total stress in body; experimental methods to determine dead load stresses in structural models are reviewed: new experimental technique termed method of integration is described; method can be used to study alternative construction procedures to result in desired pattern of dead-load stress.

AB - Structural model is described and analyzed for numerical solution; plate model consists of 2 groups of beams intersecting at right angles, one group being continuous over other; twisting moments in plate are carried by pairs of coil springs; loads are assumed to be concentrated at beam intersections; this procedure provides elastic surface, moments, etc, with higher accuracy, and only small number of simultaneous equations need to be solved.
