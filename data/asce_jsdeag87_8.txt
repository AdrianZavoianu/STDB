AB - Several types of structural members are analyzed to determine how higher strength steels can be used to their greatest advantage; influence of yield stress, modulus of elasticity, and price on optimum proportioning of structural members; it is demonstrated that through optimum design, application of higher strength steels can lead to significant material-cost savings for lighter weight structures.
