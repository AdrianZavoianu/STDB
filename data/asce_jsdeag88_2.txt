AB - Some fundamentals of system theory that may be used in analysis of wide variety of engineering problems are presented; use of lineargraph theory as technique of systems analysis in structural analysis is described, with example; it is concluded that generali ty of method makes it particularly suitable for analysis by automatic computation of highly redundant structures.

AB - Concept of generalized coordinates and generalized forces used in theory of dynamics is adapted for analysis of structures; definition of flexibilities of members is then extended so that matrix force method of analysis may be used for structures in which loads occur on members between node points; use of generalized forces and displacements is given in displacement method of structural analysis.

AB - Results of experimental investigation on strength of axially and eccentrically loaded solid round columns of 2-3/4 in. diam are presented; tests were performed primarily on stress-relieved T-1 constructional alloy steel bars; comparison with theory based on tangent modulus concept for axially loaded columns, and with inelastic-strength theory for eccentrically loaded columns, shows that ultimate strength of solid round columns may be predicted adequately by theory.

AB - Formula for determining seismic lateral-force factors similar to those used in building codes is developed from seismological data; it is based on theoretical reactions of simple, low-damped oscillators to recorded earthquake motions, assuming that each oscillator simulates motion of particular type of engineering structure; 4 relationships and concepts incorporated in formula are indicated.
