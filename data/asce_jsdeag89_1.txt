AB - A design method for steel columns as parts of a continuous frame is developed. For the design of each column, only adjacent members are assumed to provide restraint. Therefore, the column is designed as part of a subassemblage. The design is based on the ultimate strength or limit of stability of the entire subassemblage. This will usually be in the inelastic range. A check for adequacy of a column cross section as part of a subassemblage is developed. This check for adequacy has the function that the AISC interaction formula has in conventional design. The only mode of failure designed for is instability due to bending in one of the principal bendin planes. The charts and example are for the case where the column will be bent in syn metric single curvature, but the method can be extended to other cases. The design method has evolved as one of the preliminary stages in a research project being conducted on the plastic design of multi-story frames.

AB - This paper formulates a numerical procedure for calculating deflections and slopes of flexural members subject to loads acting in their longitudinal plane of symmetry. The integration of the Maxwell-Mohr strain-energy function is performed beforehand, and limits consistent with the position of the loads and step-wise variation of the moment of inertia are introduced. The tedium of recurring integration and algebraic manipulation is thus reduced to a simple summation of finite differences. A table of differences of both the cubes and the squares of integers ranging from 1 to 50 is provided to simplify the numerical work and to increase the reliability of results. Slope may be computed independently of deflection calculations, or it may be rapidly determined from known deflection values, and vice versa

AB - The behavior of bolted structural connections is discussed in synoptic form and related to current Specifications for Structural Joints Using ASTM A325 Bolts. The high clamping force in the bolts is found to improve connection fatigue strength whether or not hardened washers are used. Consideration is given to the behavior of joints assembled with bolts that are subjected to shear-type loadings and to direct tensile loadings. It is expected that, as a result of the tests and analysis presented, further changes in specifications can be made and greater economics effected in steel structures through the use of high-strength bolts.

AB - Tests were performed to provide information on the general behavior to ultimate strength of large truss-type riveted and bolted steel connections, composed of plates and rolled shapes. The variables of the test program included specimen configuration, method of hole preparation, and type and size of fasteners. The comparative behavior of the specimen is presented together with typical data. A comparison of predicted and actual efficiencies is made and recommendations are given for the design of truss-type members. Consideration is also given to the effective net width of gusset plates.

AB - A discussion and analysis is presented of the factors which affect the behavior of single and double plane tension connections fabricated of structural plates and shapes. Such connections are now designed on the basis of a theoretical net section; however, research has shown that the behavior is a function also of the geometry of the member and connection, the manner in which the stress is transferred through the connection and the method of fabrication. The efficiency of a connection is expressed in terms of the net section area, an efficiency coefficient, a fabrication factor, a bearing factor, a shear lag factor and a ductility factor, and all of these factors are included in an empirical design rule for tension connections that will result in a more realistic section, a more consistent factor of safety based on ultimate strength, and often a savings in material.

AB - A general solution is obtained for determining the buckling load of struts with tension ties. The ties, extending in length from one to the other end of the strut and bearing on several intermediate points along the column through hogging frames, are pretensioned. The tension ties precompress the column and at the same time furnish elastic supports to the column. Under the applied load, relationships between forces acting in the ties and the column and those between the lateral displacement and the reactions exerted by the ties were first developed. Then the general equation for buckling was derived and its application was shown by an example. A few models of a strut with tension ties were tested and the test results agree reasonably well with the analytical solution. Formulas were also derived for determining the initial tension and cross-sectional area of the ties in order to obtain maximum strength of a strut.

AB - Presented is an approximate solution to the problem of determining critical buckling loads for long columns with abrupt changes in inertia properties at the ends. The ends of the column are pinned; however, the axes of the pins are not parallel. The solution is obtained by using the theorem of minimum potential energy. Numerical solutions presented compare favorably with exact solutions for cases in which the ratio of moments of inertia of the center section to the end sections is greater than 0.2. Results are presented in the form of graphs for angles of rotation, ?, between 0? and 90?, and for ratios of moments of inertia between 0.2 and 0.8.

AB - An error analysis is performed to investigate the accuracy of the approximate plastic hinge method of determining the elastic-plastic deformations of structures. Because this method is based on linearized moment-curvature relationships, which overestimate the stiffness of the members, all results will be on the unsafe side. Three structures are analyzed by a more exact method based on the exact moment-curvature relationships for members of elastic-plastic material. Results are compared with those obtained by using the plastic hinge method, and indicate that the latter method furnishes results of sufficient accuracy for practical requirements.

AB - An approximate optimizing criterion is introduced in the problem of optimum design of frames. The new criterion, having the form of the elastic energy, drastically reduces the difficulties of the problem by transforming it to one of elastic analysis. In addition, it is more realistic than those previously used in that it does not require the vanishing of the cross section wherever the bending moment becomes zero. This eliminates the mathematical irregularities that complicate the problem and the absurd results to which these irregularities lead. The new criterion is applied to the minimum weight design of a portal frame, of which the continuously varying cross section depends on a single parameter and the strength, derived from resistance to bending alone, is exhausted only at plastic collapse; an upper bound of the approximation error is established. Furthermore, ways are indicated by which the approximation can be improved and the method can be applied to elastic design or the design of structures, the strength of which depends on their resistance to torsion and axial loading as well.
