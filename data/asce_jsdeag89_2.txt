AB - Tension and compression tests, transverse to and in the direction of plastic prestretching, indicate that cold stretching has pronounced effects on the mechanical properties of structural sheet steels. The effects are strongly directional and different for various types of structural steels. Increases in yield strength and ultimate strength and decreases in ductility are approximately proportional to the amount of prior cold stretching. The Bauschinger effect is present in the direction of prestretching whereas an inverse Bauschinger effect exists in the direction transverse to that of prestretching. Strain aging increases the yield strength and ultimate strength, decreases the ductility, and converts the stress-strain curve from gradual to sharp yielding. Current concepts of the crystalline nature of metals and dislocation theories are used to examine experimental observation regarding strain hardening, the Bauschinger effect, and strain aging.

AB - A simple method is presented for establishing the stiffness matrix for a rigidly jointed structure in the elastic range in which only deformations caused by bending moments are included. The standard force-displacement relationship can be used to establish the usual slope-deflection equations for a structure. Matrixes are used to solve these simultaneous equations. An example is presented that shows the use of the standard force-displacement relationships in arranging the reduced stiffness matrix for a structure. The reduced stiffness matrix can be used to determine the final displacements for all structures having the same proportions.

AB - Experiments on full-size silos and laboratory tests show that the vertical cracks that sometimes appear in deep bins are not the result of poor construction, but rather the neglect of the dynamic pressures during their design. These pressures are manifest during the emptying of deep bins, with discharge openings centrally located. Experiments have shown that the lateral dynamic pressure may reach a value as high as 2.4 times the values obtained by Janssen's theory. During bin discharge, granular flow may be either dynamic, with the resulting large pressure increases, or nondynamic without pressure increase. In order to assure against dynamic pressure failure, bins should either be designed for larger lateral pressures than those obtained by the static methods of design or one of the following installations should be made. Anti-dynamic tube placed in the center of the bin; interior rings attached to bin walls throughout the depth of the bin; or openings provided into adjacent bins at several levels, and the contents discharged through one of the bins, preferably through the one centrally located.

AB - The analysis of frames is formulated in matrix form using the slope-deflection method. The solution of the slope-deflection equations is performed by means of two similar but different iterative matrix procedures. It is shown that these two iterative procedures are equivalent to the methods of Cross and Kani. Conditions of convergence for the iterative procedures are given, and the relationship between the two methods is shown.

AB - Considering each of the six sides of a closed, pressurized box as a thin plate subjected to an unknown distribution of edge moments, the latter may be found by assuming that the rotations of adjacent edges of the plates are the same. The effect of tensile end loads on the bending of the plates is ignored, and the edges of the plates are kept straight. If the box is square-based, this leads to a doubly infinite set of equations in the Fourier coefficients of the edge moments, which may be conveniently solved by means of a digital computer after suitable truncation of the series. Numerical values of the deflections and stresses of the plates found in this manner are tabulated for five different height-to-width ratios. A similar procedure for a generalized box leads to the triply infinite set of equations which are included.

AB - The synthesis technique was used to minimize the weight, by sizing the members, of a three-bar planar truss that is subject to a multiplicity of mechanical and thermal loads. A sample problem shows how this technique is used in order to achieve a minimum weight design for a particular combination of material and configuration. For nine combinations of material and configuration, all subject to the same multiple load conditions, the minimum weight designs are compared both in cases in which buckling is an active constraint and in which buckling is not an active constraint. The incorrect selection of material and configuration can cause a substantial weight penalty, and the influence of buckling can cause a shift in the optimum material and configuration selection.

AB - An ideal, symmetrical, three-span, multi-story frame illustrates the applicability of the finite difference equation to structural problems with more than one set of unknowns. The mathematical solution of the latter is evaluated and generalized to m-span, multi-story frames. Empirical rules are developed for stress and deflection analysis of a general category of irregular building frames that will fit most practical cases. Several examples show the magnitude of error as compared to exact solutions. A procedure of successive approximation by correcting joint rotations insures against unforeseen conditions.

AB - From an analytical procedure, the computational procedure of which is restricted to columns made of an idealized elastic-perfectly plastic material that is free of residual strains, it appears that the ultimate load capacity of eccentrically loaded steel wide flange columns is considerably higher than that at first yield. The procedure may be extended to columns of other cross-sectional shapes and to those containing residual strains. The effect of the warping strains resulting from the nonuniform torque to which such columns are subjected is included in the analytical procedure. For the numerical example, the ends of the column are permitted to rotate about any axis lying in the cross-sectional plane. Twisting of the column is restrained at the ends but warping of the end cross sections is permitted.
