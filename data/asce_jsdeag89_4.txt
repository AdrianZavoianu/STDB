AB - The performance of engineering with the aid of a computer is basically a problem in man-machine communications. The conventional program approach to the use of a computer is incompatible with most engineering situations. The full potential usefulness of the computer is not realized, and the computer is sometimes misused. Hardware developments relate to efficient interaction between the man and the machine in an on-line mode. Software advances relate to problem-oriented programming languages for describing engineering situations to the computer. The combination of these developments represent a totally new level of man-machine communications ability which will materially change the role of the computer in engineering. Examples of the developments and their potential impact on engineering practice and engineering education are examined.

The availability of means of rapid processing of information has allowed for the rapid rise in scientific discovery in the twentieth century. The role of the computer in the engineer's operating as a retriever and user of information is examined. The engineering profession must do much more to meet the challenges that lie ahead in the information revolution.

AB - A plane stress model has been developed using one-dimensional elements for which a stiffness matrix can be generated having a relatively narrow band of nonzero terms. A digital computer program has been developed for this type of matrix for which the computing times are short enough and the round-off errors are small enough that solutions can be obtained for systems having several thousand degrees of freedom. This program will handle problems in plane stress analysis for any boundary conditions or thermal effects and any static loading conditions. The complete solution includes the displacements and the state of stress at all nodes of the model. The program will also handle framed structures with nonprismatic members. The results of several problems in plane stress analysis, including plates that contain holes and notches, are presented. Computing times are a matter of a few minutes per hundred equations using the IBM 7090 Data Processing System, and a few minutes per thousand equations using the IBM 7094 Data Processing System.

AB - An analytical model having a moderate number of degrees of freedom was formulated in order to represent approximately the dynamic behavior of a large steerable radio telescope antenna structure. Techniques for synthesizing simplified mathematical models for complex structures are described. A model consisting of nine rigid bodies with a total of 33 degrees of freedom was devised to represent a 210-ft diameter antenna structure having approximately 4,800 degrees of freedom. Determination of the mass, inertia, and stiffness properties of the model is presented. A method of establishing equations of motion is presented and demonstrated with a simple example having only six degrees of freedom. A tabular method for generating the coefficients in the equations is described in detail. This orderly approach to writing the equations is useful for either a hand or a computer solution. Several types of computer programs were utilized in the analysis in combination with a certain amount of hand calculation.

AB - The problem of dynamic bending of an elastic pin-ended column is studied using the large deflection theory and including axial inertia terms. Equations are derived for the motion of a column that is initially slightly curved, with one end displaced axially toward the other end at a constant speed. Numerical solutions of these equations are obtained by solving corresponding difference equations on a digital computer. These solutions are compared with previous (small deflection theory) solutions of N.J. Hoff and E. Sevin. A novel feature of the results is that in some cases the lateral deflection curves are bimodal.

AB - The results of investigation into the best digital computer solution method for finite-difference approximations to plane stress problems are presented. A general discussion of the problem and the criteria for choosing solution techniques for large systems of simultaneous equations is followed by the introduction of a new space-saving method for representing finite-difference equations. Called diagonal subscripting, it allows the coefficients of a set of 144 finite-difference equations to be stored in approximately 2,000 words of computer memory. Four methods (conjugate gradients, ordinary Gauss-Seidel iteration, accelerated Gauss-Seidel iteration, and Gaussian elimination) are described and compared from the standpoint of accuracy, computer time and storage ; requirements, and ease of programming. It is concluded that elimination is the best of the four methods for solving sparse systems of finite-difference equations, and that a slight modification of the elimination scheme provides an extremely efficient method for evaluating determinants of finite-difference matrices.

AB - A comparison is drawn between numerical and analytical approaches to problems of plate bending and buckling. Certain analytical methods are reviewed and deficiencies are noted leading to a logical development of iterative numerical techniques for achieving essentially identical results. One such technique is presented for investigating the post-buckling behavior of circular plates possessing arbitrary boundary conditions under uniform edge loads. Although a relatively simple problem, it emphasizes the development of the computer program and the conditioning of certain classes of nonlinear differential equations to fit such a program. It is seen that such a procedure resolves a fundamental shortcoming of series solutions to simultaneous, nonlinear differential equations by avoiding arguments concerning the significant number of terms required to satisfy prescribed initial and final boundary conditions with sufficient accuracy. Instead, it replaces a two point boundary value problem with an initial value problem and a Runge-Kutta numerical integration process which may be carried out step-by-step to attain prescribed kinematic and geometric terminal conditions.

AB - Single, deterministic time values associated with one cost figure in an activity-oriented system are preferable for most applications of the network planning technique. With the exception of research projects, involving previously unattempted activities, the triple stochastic time values in an event-oriented system waste the planner's time and produce results that are no more significant than those obtained by deterministic methods. Maximum benefits from these techniques can only be obtained through re-working the schedule, alternate plans, and repeated updatings. The arithmetic is simple enough for hand calculation, but the number of computations over the life of a project militates against a completely manual solution. Hence, computers are suggested for virtually all projects. Certain aspects, however, are more efficiently done by the individual. Schedule compression, distribution of float, and reassignment of resources are examples of work that should be entrusted to the electronic assistant. Comprehensive knowledge and intelligent application, not mechanical processing, are the elements of successful utilization.

AB - A technique is developed for constructing a consistent mass matrix for vibration analysis of general structural configurations. The approach is consistent with standard procedures for stiffness matrix formulation of structural problems, but accounts for the actual mass distribution within the structure in a manner similar to the Rayleigh-Ritz formulation. The basic equation for computing the mass matrix coefficients is given a physical interpretation. It is shown that the natural frequencies obtained by using the consistent mass matrix are upper bounds to the exact solution. The procedure is applicable to general dynamic response analysis and is demonstrably superior to the usual procedure of physical mass lumping by application to frequency analysis of free-free and simply-supported prismatic beams with uniformly distributed mass. It is observed that if lateral translation coordinates alone are used to represent the distortion of a uniform beam, the number of individual beam segments must exceed by one the number of natural mode frequencies it is desired to closely approximate.

AB - In order to analyze large multistory building frames efficiently by digital computer, it is necessary to use special computation techniques that take advantage of the sparse nature of their stiffness matrices. Two different methods are described and compared in this paper. Both solution techniques are based on the displacement method of structural analysis. The first employs a special form of Gauss-Seidel iteration of the equilibrium equations. The second arranges the stiffness matrix in the form of a tri-diagonal system of submatrices, and then obtains the solution by using a recursion equation. Comparisons of the two methods, based on the computer time required, indicate that either may be preferred in appropriate conditions. In general, the iterative solution is faster if only a single loading condition is to be considered, and if the structure has a relatively large number of bays. The recursion solution is faster if the structure is tall and slender, and if many loading conditions are involved.

AB - No new pitfalls are revealed in this use of the stiffness method for analyzing three-dimensional solids. Numerical experiments show the importance of using the monotonic convergence criteria. They demonstrate the desirability of using energy relations to define loading. They verify the superior accuracy of the prism geometry over the tetrahedron. The relative accuracy of various matrices correlates well with the relative values of the stiffness matrix trace and latent roots. The bases for development of four stiffness matrices are presented and coefficients cited for the matrices of special interest. Six loadings on a rectangular prism are analyzed. Exact solutions are compared with numerical results for one, eight, and sixty-four subprisms. All subprisms have the same shape. Using this shape, the trace and latent roots of each matrix are obtained. It is shown that the smaller the trace and roots, the more accurate the matrix is in solving problems.

AB - Prior to the detailed design of a ballistic vehicle, it is highly desirable to investigate many combinations of load carrying structure and thermal shield. To realize this goal, an IBM 7090 computer program was recently developed for use in preliminary design at General Electric's Re-entry Systems Department. Needing only the basic vehicle shape and aerodynamic and trajectory data, this program determines structural loads and heat flux throughout the trajectory. Using these data, the minimum weight combination of structural material-configuration and thermal shield is then selected. The program consists of four modules: Structural loads, thermal flux, thermal conductivity, and structural analyses. The structural analyses built into this program consider the common light-weight missile structures, that is, honeycomb sandwich, corrugation-stiffened sheet, waffle-reinforced sheet, and so forth. Minimum weight trends are presented for the corrugation-stiffened and waffle-reinforced shell subjected to re-entry loads of axial compression and external pressure. The comprehensive use of the digital computer in preliminary structural design optimization and synthesis programs is illustrated.

AB - The structural synthesis concept is used to automatically size members, select the geometric configuration or layout, and determine the combination of attainable material properties in order to achieve a minimum weight optimum design. The structural behavior is stress, displacement, and stability limited under a multiplicity of load conditions. Using the three bar truss to illustrate the method leads to a nine dimensional design parameter space and a nonlinear weight function. The configuration and material design parameters are treated as continuous variables in addition to the sizing parameters. The structural synthesis capacity illustrates quantitatively the feasibility of extending synthesis capabilities upward into the design parameter hierarchy, provides an efficient means for materials selection from existing materials, and suggests that structural synthesis can provide a means of determining material properties that are desirable for a particular job based on structural optimization.

AB - A method of analyzing nonlinear structural systems is presented in this paper. The method of displacements is used, and with this formulation, the characteristic equations are shown to be equivalent to a set of simultaneous nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations in which the generalized displacements are the dependent variables and the applied loading is the independent variable. The solution of these differential equations for a given set of initial conditions and loading on the structure yields the complete displacement pattern of the structure. In general, only numerical solutions of these equations are feasible or practical because of the large number of variables involved. With the displaced configuration of the structure known, the internal load distribution in the structure may be easily determined. The method is illustrated through the analysis of several structures to demonstrate its feasibility for systems of practical size and interest. Although only material nonlinearities are considered, the method may be extended to include geometric nonlinearities.

It is illustrated how, through the use of high-speed digital computation, the influence on pile behavior of factors such as ram weight, ram velocity, diesel-hammer pressure, capblock and cushion-block stiffnesses, pile material properties, and soil properties may be evaluated. Comparisons are made with the exact solution for an ideal bar and with experimental results from a field test. The effects of segment length and time interval for the discrete-element solution are examined. The use of the automatic plotting capability of the digital computer is illustrated.

AB - The effect of creep on the buckling strength of pinned, axially-loaded, initially-bent reinforced concrete columns under static sustained loading is investigated. An unstable column is defined as one which collapses before a finite desired life time has elapsed. The analysis is geometrically linear, physically nonlinear and quasistatic. The governing equations, which are of the quasilinear parabolic type, are solved by approximate mathematical and numerical methods. A digital computer program, which solves for the life time of a given column, is developed, Elasto-plastic buckling induced by creep is found to be the only important creep buckling mode. This mode is called indirect creep buckling. Results are given by graphs for the critical loads for short-time and sustained loading as functions of the slenderness and the initial imperfectness. They show that creep can significantly reduce the capacity of the type of columns investigated. The most important parameters affecting the reduction factor are the slenderness and the initial imperfectness of the column, the creep coefficient, the relative amount and yield stress of the reinforcing steel.

AB - Structural analysis is formulated using topological and algebraic laws which are counterparts of those used in treating electric network problems. The structural problem has three aspects: Topological interconnections, geometric relationship, and mechanical properties of members. Formulation as a network problem follows directly once these aspects have been identified and characterized by matrix equations. Thus, a unified and generalized approach to structural analysis is obtained. Geometric manipulations and load-deflection relationships of structural members are reviewed, and abstract topological and algebraic properties of the network problem are described. Then, equilibrium, continuity, and load-deflection relationships are shown to correspond to basic network properties. Force and displacement methods of analyzing linear, framed structures are developed as counterparts of mesh and node methods of network analysis. This formulation, adaptable to a digital computer, paves the way for applying to structural problems many existing and future developments in network analysis, design, and synthesis. Specifically, it permits the use of Kron's method of piecewise analysis.

AB - The dynamic flexibility matrix is developed for uniform members in bending including translation of joints. A force method approach for the dynamic response of continuous beams and frames with translation of joints is then developed following ideas originally indicated by Hohenemser and Prager. All of the equations necessary for the determination of natural frequencies and/or dynamic response are developed in matrix form and programmed for automatic computation on the IBM 709 digital computer. Application is made to the determination of the natural frequencies and the dynamic response of two frames: a three-member, one-bay, one-story rigid frame and a six-member, one-bay, two-story rigid frame. The numerical results are compared to results obtained by other methods. Up to six mode shapes and frequencies were obtained in these examples. The number of matrix manipulations in this method was found to exceed the number in the deformation method but the computer times were comparable. In certain cases this procedure could be advantageous.

AB - The design of a continuous steel column in an irregular and unsym-metrical multistory rigid frame for axial compressive forces and biaxial bending is a difficult task without the aid of the computer. The designer must consider the stability of the frame, over-all column buckling, lateral buckling, and local buckling in the design of a column section. A method is presented for the analysis of these requirements within the writers’ interpretation of the AISC Code (1961) and CRC's Guide to Design Criteria for Metal Compression Members. Various loading conditions and combinations make it necessary to proportion a section to satisfy a great number of interaction relationships between points of end restraint and at points of restraint. The functioning of the column program, input parameter requirements, input format, and interpretation of results from the computer are examined. Illustrative examples further demonstrate the design concepts outlined. The advantages of computer utilization in column design are presented.

AB - The deformations that occur in an actual structural frame may significantly influence the joints’ equations of equilibrium and hence the theoretical load-carrying capacity. The finite deflection theory is introduced to deal with the influence of finite displacements on the behavior of structural frames. The method is applied to rigid-jointed pitched roof portal frame and the results are presented in the form of nondimensional graphs. The bowing functions (b1 and b2) and stability functions (s and c) influence significantly the behavior of this type of frame at high load parameter which indicates their importance for the estimation of the theoretical load-carrying capacity. The classical phenomenon of elastic critical load needs to be reconsidered since the load-deflection curve does not produce the buckling phenomenon. In general, the nonlinear behavior of structural frames as influenced by instability, bowing and finite deflections are studied. A relaxation method has been developed for solving the problem because direct solution is not possible.
