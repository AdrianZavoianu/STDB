AB - A moment-balancing process is devised for finding a lower bound to the collapse load of a rigid-jointed plane grid frame for which the torsional stiffness of the constituent beam members is negligible. The method is general and can be applied to grid frames of any configuration. Regularity of beam layout is not necessary. Frames possessing cut-outs, etc., present no difficulty. Use of the process is illustrated by application to two simple frames and to one that is more complex. It is shown that, when used in conjunction with the mechanism approach, both upper and lower bounds of the collapse load are easily obtained.

AB - The analysis of arch frames is presented by means of an extension of the moment-distribution method which automatically accounts for sidesway. In the fixed-end stage, the frame undergoes translation without rotation of the joints in such a manner that the fixed-end moments and the corresponding axial and shear forces are in equilibrium with the applied loads. In the distribution stage, the unbalanced moments at the joints are relaxed by a distribution procedure in which the joints are rotated, one at a time, while all other joints are restrained against rotation. Simultaneously, the frame is again allowed to translate; thus, the equilibrium established in the fixed-end stage is preserved. Because of the translation, moments are carried over not only to the far ends of the members under consideration, but also to the ends of other members. Final end moments result directly after completion of the distribution. This procedure has an advantage over the conventional moment-distribution method, in that no restraining forces are required during the distribution stage, and the final end moments are obtained directly in a single distribution operation.

AB - The mode shapes and the natural frequencies for the first four fundamental modes of vibration are calculated for tall reinforced concrete chimneys with independent steel liners. The results seem to indicate that for each mode of an unlined chimney there is a mode of near equal frequency for the same chimney with steel liner and that the mode shape of the concrete shell is nearly the same for both cases. The lined chimney, however, could have additional frequencies spaced between those frequencies described above depending primarily on the ratio of the length of the liner to that of the concrete shell. The modes are computed by using the Stodola numerical procedure and are based on the Bernoulli-Euler flexural theory. Shear deformations and rotary inertia effects are ignored. Graphs are presented to illustrate the variations of the modes with the major parameters of the problem.

Expressions are derived for the location of the sidesway neutral axis, an axis along the girder span at which concentrated vertical loads may be applied without inducing lateral translation of the frame. Various column end conditions, member stiffness ratios, and length ratios are considered and the results are given in the form of general equations and diagrams.

AB - Circular cylindrical shell roofs prestressed by tendons placed in edge beams are considered. Prestressing force is represented by a Fourier series and several terms of the series are taken into account. For the solution of edge disturbance problem, Schorer approximation is used. The solution is facilitated by operation tables referring to a single shell and an inner shell in multiple shell structure. Two numerical examples are given. It is demonstrated that extremal values of normal stresses and transverse bending moments do not occur at midspan, but are rather displaced in the direction of the end section.

AB - The four experiments described show that galvanic corrosion of metals embedded in concrete is intensified by additions of calcium chloride to the concrete: 1. When aluminum and steel sheet, embedded in concrete and connected externally, were exposed up to one year in the atmosphere and also buried in soil, galvanic corrosion of aluminum was proportional to concentration of calcium chloride. 2. When steel-aluminum couples of various area ratios were exposed, galvanic corrosion was found to be proportional also to the steel-aluminum area ratio. 3. When aluminum conduit was embedded with steel reinforcing bars, in parallel rows, with the steel at increasing distances from the aluminum, galvanic corrosion suffered by the aluminum was inversely proportional to the distance separating the metals. 4. Where large slabs of reinforced concrete, similar to many structures, were cast with aluminum and steel embedded in them (some conduit specimens coated with bituminous paint), results showed that calcium chloride promotes galvanic corrosion when aluminum is coupled to steel or in contact with it; bituminous paint is beneficial in preventing attack.

AB - An exact theory for orthotropic plates with either torsionally soft or torsionally stiff eccentric stiffeners, first formulated by Pflüger, is described and generalized. The resulting governing equations are expressed by a set of eighth order differential equations. The approximate character of Huber's fourth order differential equation, which has been the framework of most existing approximate methods of analysis, is examined in the light of the more exact solution. A bridge deck consisting of simply supported rectangular orthotropic plate panels is chosen as an illustration. Numerical solutions are obtained for the study of the following factors: Stresses and deformations in plates with torsionally soft and torsionally stiff eccentric stiffeners based on the exact theory, and the accuracy of an approximate solution based on Huber's equation for a wide range of stiffener dimensions and spacings encountered in actual design.

AB - A new, powerful approach to the problem of the bending of beams and plates is presented. Beginning with a certain form of expression for the deflection, the entire analysis procedure is derived from matrix algebra. This expression has as its basis a 4×4 square matrix, which is characteristic of the system considered, and which can be referred to the eigen-matrix. It can be stated, therefore, that the eigen-matrix is the solution for the system. Because of the fourth degree of governing differential equations for beams and plates, the eigen-matrix is in substance a 4×4 square matrix, and is frequently subdivided into 2×2 or 2×4 submatrices. This degree, which is higher than that in the theory of electricity, will derive an increased efficiency in computations. The last step of the individual examples leads to the treatment of the inverse of a 2×2 square matrix. Simultaneous equations of many unknowns can then be dispensed with, so that the analytical computation necessary is simplified.

AB - The problem of the inelastic lateral buckling of steel wide-flange beams is treated as an extension of the classical elastic buckling solution. The method is developed for the case of equal end-moments, about the major axis of the cross section, and for simply supported lateral and torsional boundary conditions. The influence of cooling residual stresses is considered in defining the boundaries of the elastic core. The lateral and the torsional stiffnesses are computed from the assumption that only the unyielded portions of the beams resist lateral buckling. The numerical work was performed for four representative wide-flange cross sections, and the results are represented as non-dimensional critical length-versus-critical moment curves. A simplified analytical method is given, and the analytical results are compared with two empirical design equations. A straight line transition equation is proposed in the report.
