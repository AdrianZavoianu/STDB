AB - The results of four static tests on two welded constructional alloy steel plate girders are summarized and examined. The test girders were proportioned so that shear failure would be obtained. A shear strength theory based on the development of tension field action is reviewed, and its applicability to girders made of steel with a high yield point is checked with the test results. It is concluded that the theory can be applied to girders made of any structural steel.

AB - Multiple linear regression analysis is applied to predict ultimate strength of eccentrically loaded reinforced concrete columns, and all the related statistics are determined. Failure functions for different modes of failure are empirically derived, and their distribution functions are calculated. These are found to be in close agreement with the ASCE-ACI. The method used is free from theoretical assumptions about the failure mechanism and, hence, may explain the failure of experimental results. A general regression surface is constructed, and all the required statistics for the residuals are determined. Error and normal probability graphs are plotted to verify the assumptions of normality and constant variance.

AB - The results of an experimental and theoretical investigation of the energy absorption, or structural damping, characteristics of conventional plywood shear walls are described. The cyclic-loading test procedure, wherein the test specimen is subjected to a succession of reversed loading cycles of progressively increasing magnitude, was used for each test. Eight different tests were made, and the cyclic load-deflection curves were then constructed using the experimental data. From these curves, it was possible to derive back-bone curves, relating the maximum load per cycle to the average absolute value of the maximum deflections per cycle, and curves relating energy capacity to maximum deflection, energy absorption to maximum deflection, and residual deflection to maximum deflection. Values of an equivalent viscous damping ratio, νeq, were found to average 0.10 for shear walls with plywood on both sides. Having νeq, it is then possible to use the velocity response spectrum to determine the maximum relative velocity, and subsequently the earthquake energy output, for a particular plywood shear wall. The derived curves previously mentioned are used in conjunction with the energy method to obtain the maximum panel response.

AB - A method of analysis of folded plate structures that seems to offer advantages for the structural designer is presented. Influence coefficients are derived for the determination of the longitudinal edge displacements and transverse moments. The plate stresses can then be found from the edge displacements. This solution can also be easily simplified to give a membrane analysis. The method is extended to include the analysis of prestressed folded plates with both straight and curves tendons. The assumptions usually made in the analysis of prestressed beams are used. Sample problems have been solved to illustrate the application of the method.

AB - The Method of Characteristics, which forms the basis for the solution of certain flow problems in the dynamics of compressible fluids, is applied to the study of shock-wave propagation in the ground. The soil behavior is characterized by the one-dimensional pressure-deformation relation which is expressed analytically herein using a small number of parameters representing basic soil properties. A completely automatic computer program has been developed that allows pressure, displacements, and particle velocities to be determined as functions of time and position. The results of a series of numerical computations are presented that show the influence of the basic soil properties. The work is limited to the one-dimensional case.

AB - Within the framework of the simple plastic theory, a procedure is developed for the analysis of structures subjected to repeated loading and, therefore, liable to incremental collapse or alternating plasticity, or both, when two stress components must be considered. The domains of variation of the stress components in the elastic range are determined first. The plastic analysis is an extension of the well-known methods for the shakedown analysis of rectangular frames. The procedure is illustrated with reference to a reinforced concrete, uniform-section, fixed-end arch subjected to uniformly distributed live loads and variable temperature variations.

AB - The analysis of continuous curved I-beams requires the prediction of deflections for various loadings on the structure. The simplest structural element is the cantilever; therefore, the equations for deflections are derived for a circular curved, cantilever beam. The equations are presented in a series form for ready programming in an electronic computer. Tests indicate close agreement between the measured and computed values of deflections.
