AB - Expressions for the stiffness of plain shear panels with rigid edge beams are considered. The effect of edge member flexibility on the angle of diagonal tension is examined, and an expression for the load intensity on edge members, assuming a sinusoidal distribution, is derived in terms of a correction factor. By assuming the strain energy of the sheet and edge members and equating it to the external work done, the shear stiffness of the panel is found. Consideration is given to the factors that cause the actual load-deflection relationship in shear panels to be nonlinear. The predicted behavior of panels is similar to results of model tests, which show the profound effects of edge member flexibility.

AB - A solution for the analysis of a prismatic folded plate with arbitrary boundary conditions along the longitudinal joints or folds is presented. A direct stiffness method in matrix form is used with the individual plates taken as structural elements. The imposed conditions may consist of any combination of known joint loads and displacements. The solution yields results for the unknown joint displacements and reactions, as well as values of longitudinal plate stresses, transverse moments, membrane and normal shears, and transverse membrane forces. Application of both the ordinary and the elasticity theory in the development of the element stiffness matrix is given. A computer program written for the IBM 7090 computer is described, and results obtained using ordinary theory and elasticity theory are compared.

AB - Airy's stress function is used to find an expression for stresses in anchor zones of prestressed post-tensioned concrete beams. The problem is treated as a two-dimensional boundary value problem. Three cases of prestressing are studied. The extent of the lead-in-zone is found analytically. Expressions for transverse stresses within the anchor zone are derived in three cases of prestressing. The values of transverse stress obtained in these cases are compared with those obtained by Guyon and Magnel. The maximum tensile transverse stress is found, in all three cases, to be lower than that of Guyon and Magnel.

AB - Equations for beams on elastic foundations are summarized and simplified. Dimensionless influence functions are developed. Analysis of beams is reduced to simple evaluation of one-term algebraic expression. Deflection, slope, moment, and shear functions due to unit load or moment are evaluated for beams of constant elastic properties and foundation modulus. The functions are tabulated for beams of finite length and graphed for beams of semi-infinite length. The basis for comparison of functions of beams of finite with semi-infinite and infinite length is established. The tabulated and plotted data can be directly used in design or in construction of influence lines. Evaluation of functions for beams of variable elastic properties and modulus of foundation is explained, and their use in the design of a compatible beam is demonstrated.

AB - By mathematical treatment of stresses in a suspended, prestressed roof consisting of a two-dimensional network of cables lying in each direction in vertical parallel planes, it is proven that the network must generally undergo deformation under load. Neglecting the horizontal displacements of joints, an approximate solution, including the effect of temperature and deformation of frame, may be obtained. Accuracy is shown to be improved by a number of iterations.

The results, presented in graphical and tabular form, permit a comparison of elasto-plastic action with bilinear action. All investigations were conducted with the aid of a digital computer using the accelerograms of two horizontal components obtained from two of the strongest United States earthquakes recorded to date (1964).

AB - The deformation method is fundamental of the problems of buckling, bending, and simultaneous bending and compression or tension of elastic structures, such as continuous beams, frames, arches, etc. The derivation of the slope-deflection equations of the deformation method and the application of this method in solving various problems of statics, stability, and dynamics of complex systems of bars with constant cross section is described. The slope-deflection equations for the displacement method deduced in this paper makes it possible to solve problems on the buckling and bending of elastic structures (continuous beams and frames) built from solid bars with cross section varying in ways often encountered in engineering structures. The deduced formulas can be used to determine the bending moments, shear forces, axial forces, and loads in the case of frames for factory bays, crane structures, high-voltage pylons, certain elements of bridges, etc. Several examples are given.

SO - Journal of the Structural Division 1964-08-01 90(4): 175-190
AB - Methods are suggested for the design of joints and connections in precast structural concrete to help assure that all joints and connections perform their function, at all stages of loading, without overstress and with proper factors of safety to guard against failure due to overload. The recommendations are intended to apply to joints and connections between precast members, between precast members and cast-in-place concrete members, and between precast members and structural steel members. It is recommended that joints and connections occur at logical locations in the structure, and, when practical, at points that may be most readily analyzed and most easily reinforced. Precautions should be made to avoid connection and joint details that would result in stress concentrations and resulting in spalling or splitting of members at contact surfaces. Liberal chamfers, steel edged corners, adequate reinforcement, and cushioning materials are a few of the means by which such stress concentrations may be avoided or provided for. The committee decries the scarcity of research and test data concerning precast concrete connections.

AB - A study was undertaken to investigate the ultimate strength of flat slab floors with regard to ultimate flexural strength and other design factors, such as shear strength and deflection. Three reinforced concrete slab models were built and tested. All models were 10 ft square, 2 in. thick, and supported by four interior columns producing an interior panel 5-1/2 ft square. Column supports were designed to rotate and translate freely, thus minimizing the influence of column restraint and membrane stresses. Variables included percentage of reinforcement and size of column capital. Uniform loads were applied by means of air pressure, and the models were loaded to failure, which was assumed to occur when large increments of deflection were produced by negligible increases in load. The results of the test program indicate close agreement between the predicted and the measured ultimate capacities of the three model slabs. The actual yield patterns that resulted from the tests conformed, in general, to the predicted patterns.

AB - A method is presented for determining the critical state of stress, in a prestressed circular ring, at which the ring will buckle. Such rings are used as stiffening rings at the edges of shell domes and as thrust rings at the outer boundaries of ribbed or vaulted domes. The method presented allows prediction of the magnitude of the hoop force in the ring and the magnitude of the tension in the band of prestressing cables that would cause the ring to buckle. A comprehensive mode of buckling is contemplated, such that the cross sections may move radially, tangentially, and normal to the plane of the ring, and may rotate or twist about tangential axes. The case in which the cables are bonded to the ring and the case in which the cables are free to slip in the tangential direction are both treated, and provision is made, in the pertinent formulas, for handling either case. The effect of the attachment to the shell is included through the use of appropriate influence coefficients.
