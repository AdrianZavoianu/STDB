AB - Few analyses of frames subjected to variable repeated loading have been reported in the literature. This has been at least partly due to the fact that such analyses are laborious, partly to the belief that, in building work, such loadings are highly improbable. Nevertheless, theoretical and experimental evidence leaves some room for concern. Shakedown solutions for variable repeated loadings for several typical one-story frames obtained by modified linear programming method, using electronic computer are reported herein. The proportions of the selected frames were based on some realistic designs in steel. Likewise, the loading conditions considered are believed to be typical. Both the alternating plasticity and the deflection stability of frames are considered. By examining the tabulated results, comparisons between elastic, conventional plastic, and shakedown analyses for the selected frames can be readily made. It is hoped that the reported results will be found meaningful.

AB - Yield and flow stress criteria, expressing the effects of loading rate and temperature on the upper yield point, lower yield level, and flow stress under monotonic and reversed loading, are presented for low-carbon structural steel. Some techniques for applying these criteria for various time histories of stress or strain are examined. A possible design application of the criteria is illustrated for the limit design of steel frames subjected to rapid loading, and is compared to the results of an investigation of the behavior of model frames subjected to rapidly applied loadings.

AB - Experiments that define the general behavior of a 30-in. span thin metal arch buried in 50 tons of dry sand and subjected to plane-wave blast loading are described. Time-variation and space-variation of deflection, thrust, and moment are given. An attempt to measure interface pressures was largely unsuccessful, although it was found that the pressure rise time at the crown interface was approximately 6 millisec which is much longer than expected. Repeated loading of a given soil-structure system showed that the deflections from the first loading in a series were much greater than for subsequent loadings at the same overpressure. Under long-duration loads, recovery from the maximum displacement was only about 15% of the total deflection. An effort was made to get a first approximation to the variation of arching with time. Approximately 40% of the surface load was found to be carried by arching after the dynamic response had damped out.

The problems of weldment layout, selection of materials, details of welds, as well as the consideration of laminations and brittle failure are examined. One of the weldments described was developed for the 200-ft space frame cantilever of the movable roof for the Pittsburgh Civic Auditorium. The remainder were developed for the 600-ft diameter, steerable ratio telescope at Sugar Grove, West Va.

AB - The compressive and modulus of rupture strength data for 2,400○ F. to 3,400○ F. commercial brands of castables and for 1 to 4 and 1 to 6 refractory concretes were investigated. The refractory concrete test specimens were prepared from the same batch of lumnite-lelite and lumnite-calcined flint clay materials. Methods used in the Vacuum Portland Cement Concrete were adapted for this study. The data compares the strengths obtained by the vacuum-casting technique with the strengths obtained by standard-casting methods. Also, the optimum water content was investigated. Porosity, bulk density and unit weights are given for refractory concretes. Nine tables of data including results are given. The most significant result was that the vacuum-casting strengths ranged from 12% to 170% higher than the standard-cast strengths. The optimum water content for 1 to 4 refractory concrete is 7 gal per sack. Increased strengths of vacuum-cast specimens are attributed to the reduced water content, per se, consolidation of mix, and course of hydration. The magnitude of the increased strengths is shown to be dependent on the water content of the raw mix. Other properties are enhanced slightly. The results show or suggest advancements in the technology of refractories.

AB - An analytical model of a structural system consisting of a column and its adjoining members is established. To describe the behavior of the system a numerical procedure is presented for computing moments and deflections as a function of load. The analytical model has been chosen so as to approximate closely a physical system that might be tested in the laboratory. The numerical procedure has been designed to give results that are typical of the readings that would be taken in an actual laboratory test. The resulting data provide an excellent picture of the behavior of the structural components in question. As an example of the application of the analytical procedures that are presented, the behavior of a system consisting of a reinforced concrete column and its adjoining members is studied.

AB - Analytical results are presented describing the behavior under a program of increasing load of several hundred individual structural systems, consisting of a reinforced concrete column and its adjoining members. Based on these data, a study is made on the effects of several variables known to influence the behavior and capacity of this type of column. The results of this study provide insight into the behavior and capacity of reinforced concrete columns and into the factors affecting their behavior and capacity. The variables considered are: ratio of end eccentricities, eccentricity of load, slenderness ratio, and degree of end restraint.

AB - Responses of towers subjected to pressures from simulated wind records that vary with time are obtained by computer analysis. Parameters and variations include: Power-law vertical wind profile; mean yaw and standard deviation; horizontal zones to permit random velocity and yaw fluctuations; random normal deviates for wind fluctuations; foundation effect; frequency of velocity and yaw fluctuations; damping; rectangular or linearly varying wind pulses. An equivalent single-mass system, with two uncoupled degrees of freedom along mutually perpendicular planes, represents the mathematical model of the actual structure in the analysis. Results from the analyses of three different towers are presented.

AB - A series of stiffened cylinders with R/t ratios of 300, 562, and 1070 were tested for value of Z = [b²/(R t)] 1-ν² between 70 and 500. In order to determine the stiffening factor, a series of unstiffened cylinders with the same R/t ratios as these stiffened were tested. The buckling stress coefficients of the skin Ks between the stiffeners were determined in terms of the size and the spacing of the stiffeners. The best-fit curves for the buckling stress coefficient and the stiffening factor were obtained by using the regression analysis and the IBM 1620 computer. The results of this experiment can be used directly in designing a longitudinally stiffened cylinder subjected to axial compression. However, it is incumbent on the designer to decide what metal distribution between the skin and the stiffeners would be selected so that the design would be the most economical one.
