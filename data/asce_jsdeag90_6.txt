AB - This paper serves to introduce the scope of computer applications to civil engineering problems. The concept of a program, that is, the segmentation of problem-solving into a procedure phase and execution phase, is described. The effect of this segmentation on all levels of engineering work is examined, with emphasis on the changing role and responsibility of management. The development of a computer program is outlined and divided into the following steps, namely, planning, analysis, programming, coding, checking, documentation, and production.

AB - Computers and programming are introduced from the user's point of view. The computer is presented as an information processing device, and the two types of information, namely, the program that directs processing, and the data being processed, are described. The principles of stored information, addresses of information, and computer control are discussed. Programming languages, ranging from absolute to problem-oriented, are briefly described and illustrated. The concept of the composite machine seen by the user, consisting of both the machine (hardware) and processing systems (software) is presented.

AB - Formulas for allowable stresses in aluminum alloy 6061-T6 members under repeated loading are evaluated by comparing them with fatigue strengths obtained in tests of riveted, bolted, and welded joints. The formulas were included in specifications suggested by the ASCE Task Committee on Lightweight Alloys. The experimental investigation included axial-stress tests of double strap riveted and bolted joints and flexural tests of beams connected by riveting. The test results presented for welded joints include flexural fatigue tests of beams connected by welding as well as axial-stress fatigue tests of transverse and longitudinal butt welded joints, and symmetrical transverse and longitudinal fillet welded joints. In most cases, the data show that the formulas provide the desired factors of safety against failure under repeated loading, i.e., 1.35 for bridges and 1.2 for buildings.

AB - Steady-state and run-down vibration tests have been made on two modern multistory buildings. The response curves from the tests have been analyzed and the results compared. Damping determined from a run-down test is up to 2.5 times as large as the damping determined from a steady-state test. Accurate speed control is needed to precisely define the resonance curve from a steady-state test. It is concluded that the data from past forced vibration tests must be treated with caution. For various levels of excitation the damping in the lowest translational mode was found to vary between 0.5% and 1.0% for a steel frame structure and between 1.0% and 2.0% for a reinforced concrete building. These values of damping are considerably lower than values usually cited in the literature.

AB - Tabulations for aid in designing parabolic arches of variable depth are presented. Design coefficients usually given for these arches are restricted to a single abutment to crown thickness ratio for various rise to chord ratios. Even in the instance in which various abutment to crown thickness ratios are considered, only a few cases are treated because of the extensive tables needed to fully cover the case involving two parameters. To overcome this a variation in thickness was derived that permits the tabulation of the resistance of the arch to loads and end movements in terms of a single parameter, KA. Fixed end moment and reactions are given for four loading conditions. In addition, elastic constants are tabulated so that any degree of end restraint can be considered. The arch that will attain the optimum ratio of abutment to crown depth can thus be obtained without any extensive calculations. Furthermore, unusual and complex boundary conditions can be investigated.

AB - It is frequently true that several trial designs using the same basic structural configuration must be considered before arriving at an acceptable design either in terms of cost or weight. A systematic approach is developed for finding optimum (lightest or cheapest) designs for a wide class of elastic structures. Design parameters are treated as variables and optimization is accomplished by transforming the analysis and design cycle into the solution of a series of linear programming problems. Two examples are used as illustrations including a truss and a rigid frame each subjected to two distinct load conditions. Significant savings in weight may result from a small investment of computational effort. The amount of computation in performing a single cycle of linear programming optimization will not be excessive compared to the computations required for analyzing another trial design.

AB - A method is presented for solving the stability problem of inelastic frame structures in the presence of primary moments. Buckling loads are determined from an iterative procedure for plotting the nonlinear load versus deflection curve of the structure. It is only necessary to have experimental or analytical expressions for the curvature of the cross section of the frame member as a function of moment and axial force. Numerical results for the lateral buckling of a single story frame are given for frames of different geometry, vertical load pattern, lateral forces, and member cross section.

AB - Unusually large 50-ft-wide by 65-ft-high tainter gates in the Wanapum Project led to the search for an economical way of anchoring 7,560 kips of thrust into the pier. A heavily reinforced concrete block supporting the gate trunnions and anchored with fourteen prestressed cables, each of 635 kip capacity, provided the answer. Because of the complicated three dimensional state of stress inside the anchor block and the monolithic construction with the pier, extensive structural model tests were necessary. Aluminum models (stress coat and strain gages) and a three dimensional photo-elastic model were used. Analyses were used for backup and provided tools for design of similar anchor blocks in the future without model tests. Each cable of 635 kip capacity consisted of 90 1/4-in.-diameter high-strength steel wires with button head ends of the BBRV type. All cables for a single pier were prefabricated into a single assembly. A construction joint between the anchor block and the pier permitted uninterrupted concrete placement. Swift progress of all phases of work confirmed the practicability of the scheme. A significant cost advantage resulted, compared with a structural steel, unbonded anchorage.

AB - Analysis of continuous beams with variable moment of inertia is simplified by using a general form for the equation of three moments. Influence lines for bending moments, shearing forces, and reactions are directly obtained using this equation. In continuous steel girder bridges with concrete floors, the participation of the concrete deck can take place only in the regions of positive moments in which the concrete is subjected to compressive stresses. The moment of inertia of the composite section is considerably greater than that of the active steel section under negative bending moments. The final bending moment diagram, which fixes the part subjected to the composite action in each span, is itself dependent on the position of these parts when the moment of inertia increases. The exact length and position of these parts, is found to have a comparatively small effect, so that the final bending moment diagram under each particular loading can be obtained from a first suitable trial position of positive moments without further correction.

AB - The results of 31 tests on small scale mild-steel I-section stanchions are presented. The specimens were loaded by a constant axial load and bending moment acting at one end in the plane of the web. Minor axis and longitudinal rotations were prevented at both ends; the minor axis slenderness ratio varied between 75 and 195. Two sections were used, both rather thick-walled, so that there was no danger of local buckling. Consequently, failure occurred by either excessive (in-plane) bending or lateral-torsional buckling, mostly in the plastic range. A stiff bending device allowed the moment-rotation curve to be followed in the falling part of the curve. The experimental rotation capacity, defined as the angle of plastic rotation at nine-tenths of the maximum (collapse) moment has thus been obtained for each specimen. These rotation capacities, plotted versus the axial load and the slenderness ratio, suggest a regular pattern, irrespective of the type of failure which is similar to the theoretical pattern obtained by other authors. No theoretical analysis of the results is developed.

AB - The concept of reversed deformation is described. By using this technique, it is shown that any prestressed indeterminate structure can be designed without solving compatibility equations. The shape of the fully stressed structure and the stresses in the members are chosen prior to design. This approach is particularly suitable for the design of highly redundant and nonlinear structures on the basis of permissible stress criterion. The method is illustrated with examples of both skeletal and shell structures. Variational equations for minimum weight are stated. The notions of neutral lines and regular and irregular panels are introduced, and optimum solutions are given for various types of prestressed plates and beam grids (grillages). The concept is compared with other optimum design methods.

AB - The operational method, similar to the theory of electricity, can be available for continuous systems in applied mechanics of solids. Two kinds of continuous beams are treated: Continuous beams with rigid supports, and continuous beams with elastic supports. According to the operational method, simultaneous equations are no longer necessary even for a large number of spans. The entire procedure of analysis is developed in matrix algebra, in which the necessary physical quantities, the boundary conditions, and the connection conditions between two consecutive spans are all expressible in terms of corresponding matrices. Thus, the solution can be obtained by formal operations, multiplications, and at times additions, among these matrices. The present analysis will demonstrate more efficiency in computations than shown in previous fundamental systems. Similar developments can be made for the case of distributed loads and for continuous systems other than those cited herein.

AB - A general systematic procedure for the design of structures is presented, and its application to framed structures is outlined. The problem is defined in such a way that the required proportions become the dependent variables for which the solution may be determined from the design criteria: Required behaviors in terms of stress, strain, or displacement, at the various loadings involved; minimum weight or minimum cost; and conventional constraints imposed by the site, the codes, or the function of the structure. Particular cases considered are a multistory metal frame, and a prestressed concrete frame in each of which geometry is considered fixed. For the metal frame the behavior criteria introduced are: The degree of interaction of moments between the beams and columns, and elastic or inelastic failure criteria for each. In a prestressed concrete frame, additional criteria may be satisfied allowing the tendons, also, to be completely determined. That the procedure described leads directly to the automation of the design process is noted.

AB - Formulas are presented for determining the local buckling strength of round aluminum tubes in compression, bending, and torsion. The formulas cover both the elastic and inelastic stress ranges and, for compression and bending, apply to circumferentially welded as well as nonwelded tubes. Predicted strengths are found to be in good agreement with the results of tests and analytical studies on buckling of tubes. Experimental studies considered are confined to tubes of aluminum. However, analytical considerations indicate that the proposed formulas may be applicable to other materials with similar stress-strain characteristics. Design data on mechanical properties, column strength, and weld strength of aluminum tubes are also given.
