AB - Eleven 4 by 4 M 13.0 structural steel cantilever beams were subjected to cyclic reversed loading. The maximum strain at the clamped end was carefully controlled and varied between ± 1.0% and 2.5%. In all instances, except for 1% controlling strain, the strains induced in the distorted flanges caused early formation of cracks that finally led to the fracture of the beam. In the experiments the number of cycles to cause fracture varied from 16 to 650. A drastic drop in the low cycle fatigue endurance occurred in the beams as the controlling strain was increased. An analogous relationship was observed between the number of cycles causing the initiation of local buckling of flanges and controlling strain. Based on these experiments it is concluded that in low cycle fatigue of structural steel members of large strains, local buckling of flanges is of the utmost importance. The problem of preventing local buckling of elements is considerably more important than that which concerns the low fatigue endurance of the material itself.

AB - A method has been developed whereby a strip of high-strength steel can be pretensioned and bonded to the face of a wood beam so that it will, on release, transfer force to the beam in the form of uniform shear in finite end zones. The method was used to prestress full-size beams laminated from grade L-3 Coast Region Douglas-fir. Their structural behavior was studied and compared to that of matched unprestressed beams. Test data show that the prestressed wood beams behave essentially as predicted by theory; that they exhibit greater stiffness, greater strength, lass variability of strength, far greater work to maximum load, and design loads that are predictable and far in excess of those for the matched unprestressed beams.

AB - Recommendations are presented for the design of solid round columns made of any commercially available structural steel. These design formulas are based on experimental and analytical work that is summarized in the paper. Correlation between theoretically predicted and experimentally determined ultimate loads is shown to be excellent, and an adequate margin of safety exists between the design formulas and the curves representing the theoretical ultimate load. The effects of residual stresses as well as initial crookedness are reflected in the design equations.

AB - Equations available in the literature for the elastic buckling load of built-up prismatic members are critically evaluated. It is found that the choice of equation markedly influences the results in cases of practical interest (three-legged compression members with battens for bracing). An experimental and analytical investigation suggests a revised formula for the buckling load. A modification for existing formulas to extend their use to three-legged towers and columns is developed.

AB - Tests on half scale models of masonry walls built on point supported continuous beams show that the structure behaves like a composite diaphragm girder, with the foundation beam acting as a tension tie. The reactions on the interior supports are considerably smaller than those of ordinary beams and, as a result, the external moments are positive throughout the length of the wall. The main cause of failure is crushing of masonry above the supports. Vertical stanchions at the supports increase the failure load but do not change the mode of failure that occurs after separation between stanchions and masonry through vertical cracks. An approximate method of design, disregarding forces at the wall-beam boundary, was found to yield reliable results, especially with regard to the safety factor against failure.

AB - The paper presents methods for the analysis of framed structures which behave primarily as shells. Questions of membrane forces, analogous elastic properties, and buckling criteria are treated. The collapse of a 307-ft span reticulated dome in Bucharest in 1963 is investigated, and it is shown that the analyses presented in the paper gives a buckling load which is only approximately one-fifth of the critical load expected by the original designers, but which indeed agrees within 10% with the actual load at failure. Analyses of other important reticulated domes are also given.

AB - Charts and empirical formulas are provided for the accurate calculation of the torsion constant for the wide flange, I, channel, tee, zee, and angle structural shapes. The differential equation in solving the torsion stress function is replaced by a difference equation, and the stress function is evaluated at nodal points of a fine square mesh net by means of the digital computer. The formulas for the torsion constant make use of existing solutions for the rectangular section but provide accurate correction for the additional torsional rigidity resulting from the juncture of rectangular component parts including the effect of the fillets and the variation in flange thickness of the channel and I-sections. Shear stresses caused by uniform torsion are also evaluated. Calculations for both torsion constant and stress are aided by means of graphical charts.

AB - Methods for analyzing slenderness effects in tier buildings are proposed. Some of these methods apply to buildings with braced frames, as well as to those with unbraced (space) frames. The simplest methods cover the analysis of buckling and interaction of vertical and lateral forces in a single story under the assumption that the story stiffness is a constant. Next, assuming equal joint rotations in each floor, step-by-step and iteration methods are introduced. Further refinements include consideration of unequal joint rotations and individual-column buckling. The methods are extended to cover torsion in three-dimensional structures and to nonlinear behavior. It is contended that the usual individual-column treatment of slenderness effects is inadequate for most practical cases and in few buildings can sway be regarded as truly inhibited.

AB - An analytical solution for the interior panel of a multiple span, multiple bay ribless prismatic shell is presented. The approach to the problem entails a two-step procedure. First, the load is assumed to be applied to a panel with continuous supports along the longitudinal edges. The vertical reaction along the assumed continuous supports is next transferred to the columns by the application of a corrective edge line load along the longitudinal edges of the panel. In view of the extensive computation entailed in the analysis, the solutions were programmed for a high speed electronic computer. Loads of arbitrary distribution in the transverse direction but uniform in the longitudinal direction are considered. Special cases of dead load and uniform live load are treated in detail. The effects of the different shell parameters on the stress resultants and the displacements were studied.
