AB - Equations have been developed for use in the design of structures sustaining all types of superimposed dynamic loads with short time histories. Explosion-type blast waves in an air medium are used to illustrate the procedure for solution of the equations. Particular solutions for blast waves are formulated graphically with the aid of digital computers. In the past, attention has been concentrated almost exclusively on peak values of pressure, and few attempts have been made to incorporate the shock wave's entire history. Because a structure's dynamic response depends not only on peak values of pressure, but also on the characteristics and histories of all related waves, it is necessary to have an adequate description of the shock wave before an accurate loading condition can be predicted. For a designer to proceed with an analysis of a structure under any loading condition, he must have a full understanding of the nature of the real structural responses before attempting simplifications to facilitate procedure. The object of this paper is to provide this understanding in the area of dynamic loads with short time history.

AB - In a series of previous papers, the senior writer has shown how the post-elastic buckling behavior of steel beams depends on the strain-hardening properties of the steel. Specifically, it has been shown that both the inelastic lateral buckling and local buckling of steel members are functions of the strain-hardening modulus, ESH, of the material used.

Using this method, a set of influence lines is obtained for the beams with free ends, such that the design of beams on elastic foundation is brought within the easy reach of an ordinary structural engineer.

AB - Measurements were made of the movements at connections of a 310-ft railway bridge over a period of 3-1/2 yr. The study was initiated during shop-assembly of a truss and was ended after 3 yr of service loading. As might be expected, substantial relative movements of the bridge joints occurred during erection with the addition of dead load, bracing, and floor systems. The effects of the measured movements on changes in camber are examined and compared with level readings taken during the 3 yr of traffic. In essence, no service movements were found; no evidence of a marked change in camber was found. These findings suggest that a properly designed structure with properly installed high-strength bolts will not slip under normal service loadings.

AB - Cylindrical shells subjected to rings of force are considered. The material is rigid or elastic-perfectly plastic governed by any reasonable yield criterion. Stresses at limit load are investigated. Expressions for the rates of deformations in terms of stresses at the limit load and for the rates of total energy dissipation and partial dissipations because of bending and because of expansion and or contraction, or both, in terms of limit loads and deformation rates, and derived. Shells loaded symmetrically and nonsymmetrically by a ring of force are considered, results of the numerical Integration of the equations of equilibrium at plastic flow governed by the Tresca yield condition are plotted, and expressions for the rates of deformations and energy dissipations are presented. Limit loads, modes of deformation and stress distributions can be determined by the graphs produced. Results of an experimental investigation, which are in good agreement with theoretical prediction, also are presented.

AB - Double shear tests of single 7/8-in. and 1-in. high-strength bolts are reported. Altogether, ninety-six A325 bolts were tested in A7 steel jigs or in A440 steel jigs. Eighty-four A354BC, A354BD, and A490 bolts were tested in jigs made of A440 or constructional alloy steel. The effect of a number of variables on the shear strength and deformation at ultimate load was studied. The study showed that bolts tested in tension jigs had shear strengths 10% lower than bolts tested in compression jigs. Initial preload, faying surface condition, and type of connected material had no significant influence on shear strength. The shear resistance of a bolt was directly reflected by the available shear area. Also, it was found that the ultimate shear stress was approximately 73% of the tensile strength for A325 bolts tested in compression jigs and approximately 68% when these bolts were tested in tension jigs. For A354BC, A354BD, and A490 bolts, the corresponding values were 69% and 62%.

AB - A rigorous linearized analysis of the creep buckling problem is presented, in order to evaluate critical loads in many different cases, including some nonlinear (physical) materials. The concept of the reduced modulus is emphasized, showing that its value is independent of geometrical and structural characteristics of the bar. In view of the viscoelastoplastic behavior of many construction materials, actual critical loads are finally evaluated by means of a combination of the linearized analysis and the P-M interaction diagram. In this way a technical approach is proposed that takes into account the initial imperfection of the bar, beam-column effect, and elastoplastic characteristics of the material. It is shown that the load evaluated with the reduced modulus is an upper limit of the actual critical load.

AB - Analysis is made of a cellular steel gate structure, consisting of a series of horizontal webs, vertical webs, and skin plating on both sides. The usual structural design is based on considering the gate as a rectangular slab supported on three sides. An alternative and more realistic method of analysis is presented. The structure is considered as composed of an assembly of plane cover and web elements. The lines of intersections of these elements intersect at finite number of points, at which conditions of equilibrium, compatibility of deformations and boundary conditions are satisfied. The comparison between this method and the idealized plate method shows that the plate method can furnish sufficiently good information regarding the distribution of the normal stresses in the cover plates. Also, except for a zone around the edges, the plate method furnishes sufficiently good information regarding the distribution of the shear stresses in the cover plates. However, the plate method fails to furnish sufficiently good information regarding the distribution of the shear stresses in the webs or the reactions at the supports.

AB - A method is proposed to compute deflections throughout an elastic-plastic plane frame. It is related to the Williot-Mohr analysis for trusses. After the force analysis, all frame joints are pinned and member ends allowed to rotate. Continuity is then restored where required by movement of the pinned mechanism in beam and sway modes. The method is extended to statically indeterminate frames with force analysis by relaxation. Examples illustrate the application. The method is simple in concept and is suitable for practical use. The influence of the spread of the plastic hinges is explored in an appendix and found to be unimportant under normal circumstances with concentrated loads.

Three hemispheres tests were conducted. Two tests were made on hemispheres of different size with different Reynold's numbers and differing relationship to the boundary layer; both models were spun and lightly polished. A third hemisphere test was made with an artificially roughened surface. Four domes (spun and lightly polished) of varying span to rise ratio were also tested. The results are presented in the form of pressure coefficient contour maps of the surface.

AB - An approximate analytical method is presented for evaluating the effects on structural response of blast shields composed of crushable materials. In the analysis it is assumed that the structure can be represented by a mass spring system with a constant restoring force and that the shield is composed of a rigid-locking material. The analysis gives the response of this idealized shield-structure model to initial peak triangular pulse loadings. The results show that shielding is ineffective unless the pulse duration is short with respect to a certain time characteristic of the shield. Shielding is most effective when the crushing strength is equal to the static strength of the protected structure and when the thickness is sufficiently great to preclude complete compaction of the shield.

The method applies to isolated struts, struts continuous through several supports, or complete frameworks containing struts with nonuniform axial loads. Good agreement was found between this approximation and calculations performed on an electronic computer.
