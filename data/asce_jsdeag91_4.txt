AB - The effect of various misalinement patterns on functional characteristics of the bolted joints has been investigated. The results have also been compared with findings of previous research. The conclusions indicate that unsymmetrical misalinement might cause definite readjustments in the behavior of the joints while in the process of loading. Major characteristics, such as ultimate load and joint efficiency, are not significantly changed. Because the readjustments require plastic deformations, the present results apply only to steels with sufficient range of plastic deformability.

This proposition, demonstrated earlier theoretically, is now confirmed by several tests involving I-and H-beams made of high strength aluminum alloy 65S-T6 (American designation 6061-T6), whose strain hardening rate is low.

AB - In the field of protective structures to resist the effects of nuclear weapons, the soil-structure interaction zone is defined as the region between the 30-psi surface air overpressure range and the 1,000-psi range where structures are buried to depths to approximately 200 ft. At ranges nearer ground zero than the 1,000-psi range, the peak blast pressure increases rapidly. In addition to air blast, a surface or sub-surface burst reacts violently with the ground producing a crater and an associated ground shock of high intensity. If protection is required in such regions, it is necessary to build structures at great length and, in all probability, in rock. Two laboratory devices for simulating the air blast effects of nuclear devices are described. A fundamental study concerning the basic problem of soil arching is evaluted; a program concerning the response of buried, semicircular, fixed-end concrete arches is reviewed; a program to extend the range of knowledge of failure phenomena for circular buried cylinders is briefed; and a basic type of similitude study for buried aluminum arches is described.

AB - A strong impetus for development of ceramic structures arises from the growing need for structural materials that may be used at high temperatures, particularly in aerospace structures. Ceramics are capable of supporting considerably larger loads in compression than in tension; some possess unusually high compressive strengths and relatively low density, characteristics enhancing their promise for lightweight structures. The fracture strengths of brittle ceramics usually show wide range of scatter, and appear to be related to the probability of the existence of flaws. Therefore, the designer of a ceramic structure must consider the nominal range characteristic of fracture strength values. The effects of size, shape, and method of fabrication of structural elements are important in this connection. The presence of randomly-distributed pores (of uncontrolled shape) in a ceramic drastically reduces its compressive strength; it has been found that directional cellulation has considerably less effect. Considerable promise exists in the use of prestressing with ceramics. A brief review is given of research with prestressed ceramics.

AB - The effects of certain nonlinear factors in the behavior of tall guyed towers are studied to determine their importance with respect to a static analysis of such towers. Nonlinear features that are studied in detail are: (1) The movement of the upper end of the guys caused by eccentricity of their connections to the mast and by flexural and compressive shortening of the mast; (2) variation of flexural stiffness of the mast because of axial loads; and (3) the influence of wind force on the guys. Numerical results are presented for an 1,100-ft, four-level tower subjected to both symmetrical and unsymmetrical loading conditions. Comparisons are made between an accurate solution and solutions that neglect certain combinations of the nonlinear factors of the problem. The results were obtained with the aid of a general guyed-tower program written for the IBM 7090 computer, and approximately 2 min of computer time were required for each solution.

AB - An approximate method is developed to calculate the short-time deflections of multiple-panel reinforced concrete floor slabs. The results of the method are compared with those of exact solutions and tests on five multiple-panel reinforced concrete test structures. The short-time deflections of reinforced concrete slabs under existing working loads are predicted better on the basis of the uncracked sections because a large part of the slab area is uncracked. Slab construction may owe its successful behavior under working loads primarily to the tensile strength of the concrete.

AB - A simple method of calculating the elastic, torsional-flexural buckling load of centrally-loaded, thin-walled columns with singly-symmetrical sections is presented. The method is based on the use of an interaction equation. Curves for determining the parameters necessary to use the interaction equation are given. Because buckling of singly-symmetrical sections can occur either in simple bending or in simultaneous bending and twisting, a set of curves for determining which of these modes is critical for any shape and length is also presented. By the use of effective lengths for bending and warping, the theory, originally limited to hinged and fixed ends, is extended to include members with elastic end restraints as well. Based on various experimental results, the linear theory is shown to predict satisfactorily the carrying capacity of actual columns that buckle elastically.

AB - Part of the energy of an ultimate loading or of a severe earthquake shock is usually absorbed by the inelastic deformation of the structural frame. In order to assess the inelastic deformability of a steel frame and its ability to absorb energy, it is necessary to know the load-deformation behavior of its various components. The inelastic load-deformation response of beams, beam-columns, and beam-and-column subassemblages that are subjected to static unidirectional loading is examined. The relevent response criterion for a member is the end moment-end rotation relationship. It is shown, both from experimental and theoretical considerations, that the inelastic load-deformation behavior of many steel frames and frame components can be predicted and that, therefore, the energy absorption capacity of these frames can be assessed. Thus, the basis exists for a rational statical analysis and guidelines are provided for future dynamic studies.

AB - The elastic and plastic behavior of ASTM A-36 tubular beam columns is studied. Experimental results for three tests of tubular beam columns are presented. These tests show that the tubular section is appreciably stronger than a similar wide flange section. This is especially apparent when the beam column is subjected to a relatively large axial load. A theoretical investigation of the tubular shape of a beam column is also conducted. Theoretical moment-axial load-curvature ratio curves are derived for the tubular section with no residual stresses. Values of curvature are numerically integrated to obtain the theoretical beam column buckling load. These data are compared to current analysis equations for beam columns.

AB - A plate, containing a sizeable rectangular opening with circular corner fillets, subjected to uniaxial tension, is analyzed by a finite element method. Values are obtained for the maximum stress in an unreinforced plate, a plate with a ring of reinforcing around the edge of the opening, and for several cases with strips of reinforcing parallel to the direction of the applied load. These values are used as a measure of the effectiveness of the various reinforcing configurations studied. Experimental confirmation of the magnitude of the maximum stress is presented for the unreinforced plate and for one reinforced case. The results presented give some insight into the relative effectiveness of the different reinforcing configurations in reducing the maximum stresses occurring in the plate.
