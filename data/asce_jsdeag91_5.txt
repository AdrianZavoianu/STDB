AB - Basic requirements for the design of concrete buildings for earthquake resistance are given. The elastic behavior of prestressed components and their allowable stresses and load factors are evaluated with respect to earthquake loads. The energy absorption capacity of prestressed members under flexure, shear, combined bending, and shear is reviewed. Prestressing of concrete slabs, shafts, and rigid frames for earthquake resistance in buildings is described. Seismic design of tall buildings for dynamic loads is compared to design for static loads using code values.

AB - Relatively deep rectangular concrete beams were tested to failure under bending and shear loading. The beams had longitudinal tension and compression reinforcement. Concrete strength, length-depth ratio, quantity of longitudinal steel, and the quantity and type of web steel was varied. The strength and behavior was related to that observed in conventional beams under similar loading conditions.

AB - An ultimate strength design method for highway bridges is presented. Highway bridges have variable live load capacity, and the smaller bridges control highway system capacity. It is demonstrated that the present minimum capacity is 2.0 live loads. A lower bound loading of 1.5 dead loads plus 2.0 live loads is advocated for all common bridges. This loading is applied to concrete decks, reinforced concrete girders, prestressed girders, composite steel girders, trusses, and substructures. These have intermediate grade reinforcing steel and A36 structural steel. Concrete girder bridges can be completely designed using existing specifications. Development work remains to be done on steel girder bridges and trusses. The proposed design method offers consistent service ratings and material economics in all common bridge types. The savings are estimated to be 4% of the national bridge budget.

AB - A modified method of moment distribution, to include sidesway, is presented. The ordinary factors encountered in the Hardy Cross method are adequately adjusted and the procedure slightly modified so that only one moment distribution will produce the final moments in the analysis of a rigid frame (gable frames excluded). This method is recommended especially for preliminary wind and earthquake design of multistory buildings.

AB - The strength of single-story, pinned-base rigid steel frames subjected to vertical and horizontal loads is developed. Interaction curves between the axial load and the horizontal load are developed for a column L/r = 40. Inelastic behavior and residual stresses are considered. Equilibrium of the deflected structure is considered so that the P-Δ effect (the additional moments caused by the deflection at the column tops and the axial load in the columns) is investigated. The structural behavior of the structure is examined. The results of the analysis are compared with the 1961 and 1963 AISC Specifications, and a simple plastic analysis performed on the deflected structure. The effect of variation of column slenderness ratios is also evaluated.

AB - A method for analyzing nonsway beam-and-column subassemblages, which are parts of a braced multistory frame, is presented. The type of subassemblage studied consists essentially of a column framed at its ends to beams of known properties. When subjected to load, the beams will deform with the column and thus provide restraint at the ends of the column. The method can be used to study both the elastic and inelastic behavior of subassemblages provided the material properties are known. Application of the method to the analysis of beam-columns continuous over several supports is also illustrated.

AB - The current (1965) criteria for proportioning bearing-type bolted joints are reviewed. The concepts of balanced design are examined and existing test results of bolted A7 and A440 steel connections fastened with A325 bolts are analyzed and compared with theoretical results. The examination of the currently used design concept showed that: (1) The concept of balanced design leads to inconsistent allowable bolt stresses for different plate materials; (2) the high-strength bolt behaves similarly under shear in a compact joint regardless of the type of connected material; and (3) the balanced design concept has no meaning in long joints because the bolts unbutton before the plate material can attain its full strength. A more logical design philosophy is suggested and possible design guides are outlined. The criterion is based on the shear strength of the bolt in various steel joints and is applicable to both the A325 and A490 high-strength bolts.

A total of 115 bolts were tested and the results were analyzed with consideration being given to such factors as location of the shear plane of loading, proportion of tension and shear loads, length of grip, bolt type and diameter, and type of material bolted. The results were compared with design equations now (1965) used in the United States.

AB - A general theoretical solution for the load partition in double-lap butt joints is developed. The solution is applicable to both the elastic and inelastic regions of bearing-type connections. The solution was aided by the development of analytical expressions for the stress-strain relationship of plates with holes and for the shear-deformation relationship of high-strength bolts. A digital computer program was developed to make the solution practical. The theoretical solution was compared with test results of large bolted connections and showed good agreement with the greatest difference between test and theory of approximately 4%. The solution is used to study the influence varying the relative proportions of the bolt shear area and the net tensile area. This study showed that an increase in net plate area increased the average shear strength of the fasteners in the longer joints. Supplemental tests are shown to verify this behavior.

AB - The behavior of a flat plate, the first of the five test structures built and tested in the course of an investigation of multiple-panel reinforced concrete floor slabs, is described and analyzed. The test structure, which comprised nine 5-ft square panels, was designed essentially on the basis of the ACI Building Code. Test data included deflections at 33 locations, reinforcement strains at 294 locations, and all three components of each of the column reactions. Comparisons of the moments measured in the critical sections of the test structure with the ACI design moments indicated that the total extent of flexural reinforcement provided by the design method in the entire structure was not deficient but that the distribution specified was inefficient. The overall behavior of the test structure was satisfactory at all levels of loading as was the measured over-all load factor of 2.3. However, collapse was caused by punching through of one of the interior columns. The flexural strength of the slab was higher than the load that could be transmitted from the slab to the interior columns.

Continuity of each structure is achieved by a separate Cross relaxation process for moments and for longitudinal stresses. All necessary data, such as fixed-end moments, deep beam stresses, slab stiffness, etc., are presented in tables. The rather small influence of deflections is dealt with by considering the deflections of the deep beam system as support settlements of the continuous two-way slab.

AB - Tests were conducted on two lots of A490 bolts at Lehigh University and the University of Illinois to determine if testing procedures constitute a variable. Over 100 calibration tests were conducted of 7/8-in. by 5 l/2-in. and 7/8-in. by 9 1/2-in. ASTM A490 high-strength bolts. These included 40 direct tension tests and 60 torqued-tension tests. The torqued-tension tests were conducted in hydraulic calibrating devices and in solid steel blocks. Data on bolt tension, elongation, turns-of-nut, and general behavior were analyzed. The tests showed no significant difference between the results obtained at the two universities. The tests showed that the direct tensile strength was 10% to 20% greater than the torqued tension strength. Only the shorter bolts (7/8-in. by 5 l/2-in.) reached proof load after one-half turn from snug. Comparisons of bolt behavior when torqued in the hydraulic bolt calibrator and in the solid steel block showed that less load was induced into the bolt at one-half turn in the hydraulic calibrator. This study shows that additional rotation beyond one-half turn is necessary for the longer A490 bolt if the proof load is to be reached.

AB - A general method of plastic analysis and a procedure for the proportioning of non-prismatic members composed of symmetrical sections and subjected to proportional loadings has been developed. Plastic hinges are classified in terms of their location in order to facilitate the analysis. By using approximate hinge locations and repeated iterations, the actual hinge locations may be determined and the collapse load evaluated. The plastic design of a non-prismatic member consisting of a web and two flange plates involves several parameters which have been related. Design charts have been prepared that will enable a haunch of minimum weight to be selected for any specified loading.
