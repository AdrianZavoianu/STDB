AB - A method is developed to analyze continuous structures (with nonprismatic members) with the use of the currently (1966) published moment distribution factors. From this method, unknown support moments can be solved directly by simultaneous equations. Examples are shown for analyzing a three span nonprismatic beam with external loadings and support yielding.

AB - A method of analysis is presented for curved girders on flexible supports for an interchange structure where geometrics, underclearance, and aesthetics dictated a suspended system. The structure, Ramp G, is suspended from an upper level steel girder that carries the Southwest Freeway over South Capitol Street in Washington, D.C. The procedures established for design reduced the indeterminate system essentially into two problems: (1) Analysis of a straight continuous girder on flexible supports; and (2) resolution of torsional forces caused by curvature. To check the assumptions and design procedures, the structure was field tested. Dead load measured reaction results compared well with computed dead load reactions. A 35-ton truck was used to perform live load tests. Of particular interest was a test run of the truck at 40 mph and a sudden application of the brakes to test for side sway and vibration. No appreciable sway or deflections were observed.

AB - The stiffness properties of a finite sized model element of a plate under plane stress are presented. The mathematical model is a piece of the material itself and not a configuration of bars that replace the material. It is shown that an additional deformation condition should be specified instead of an arbitrary arrangement of bars. An example shows that this extra condition considerably increases the accuracy of the model and so reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to approximate the continuous system. A system of bounding the deflection under a single load is shown by assigning values to a free parameter. Thus, the maximum error is known and can be reduced without going to a fine grid.

AB - Numerical procedures, suitable for digital computers, are given for analyzing suspension bridges under arbitrary conditions of live loading and temperature effects. The technique of analysis is to treat the cable, suspenders, and deck as forming a special type of open panel truss. By allowing for tower flexibility, a rigorous method of including the interaction between side and main spans has been obtained. Three distinct methods of bridge analysis have been given, each differing from the others in the choice of variable used for formulating the governing equations. The variables chosen were: Cable displacements, hanger tension, and stiffening girder bending moments. Corresponding to each method, an iteration routine is presented for solving the nonlinear governing equations. As might be expected, these show differences in the computational effort required to generate answers of specified accuracy. All three methods do, of course, generate identical results. Finally, the results of solving a long span bridge by all three methods are given, and these are compared with the values obtained by more conventional means.

This method, a direct solution technique, is developed for the displacement method of structural analysis. The technique can be applied to both general and banded stiffness matrices. An algorithm for the Gauss elimination, designed for symmetric, positive definite matrices, is described. Timing comparisons (operation counts) are given for banded and fully populated matrices. A simple numerical example is given that illustrates the solution alogorithm and the selective inversion process.

AB - The incidence of brittle behavior in bolts and studs heat treated to high strength levels (150 ksi to 250 ksi) is studied. The objective was to try to find a relationship between brittle behavior and the intrinsic characteristics of the bolt material. There was no suitable correlation of brittleness with strength or ductility but it was found that the notch tensile properties are a good indicator of relative brittle behavior. Assembly conditions and the physical geometry of the fastener were shown to be important to load carrying ability. Tests reported are all based on static loading.

Although attention is restricted herein almost to the ordinary beams, similar treatment can be extended to more complicated beams or plates. Typical applications are presented.

The planes containing guys with or without insulators or ice loading are changed by drag and lift forces produced by wind; and these forces together with tower motion are used to compute the variable spring constants for determining guy reactions. All significant secondary effects including increase in shear caused by shaft distortion and web member strains, eccentricity of shaft between guy levels, and external moments produced at each level by the guys are considered. An analysis of two-way bending of guyed towers is also included and a method of solution presented.

AB - The analysis of systems of structural elements, as opposed to the analysis of the behavior of individual structural members, is examined. Parts of network theory having a bearing on structural analysis, and the network formulation of structural analysis, are briefly presented. The matrix formulation is summarized, and the transformations involved are examined. The two formulations are compared, and it is shown that they yield identical equations describing the systems, but that the network formulation has conceptual and computational advantages. This formulation also makes easier the transference of techniques from other disciplines, such as Kron's method of piecewise solutions. Finally, it is shown that the network formulation can serve as a basis for efficient and general computer programs.

AB - A method is presented for the computer analysis of translational shells by numerical integration. Both the general cylindrical shell equations, obtained from Love and Reissner, and a simplified set of equations for shallow translational shells are formulated for numerical integration. A Lévy type solution is assumed for the shell displacements and the governing partial differential equations are reduced to a system of eight first order linear differential equations. The shell boundary value problem is converted into an initial value problem that is solved on a digital computer by a numerical integration scheme permitting the rigorous analysis of a translational shell with variable thickness, curvature, and loading. The number of simultaneous equations to be solved depends only on the number of boundary conditions and not on the number of integration steps. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the behavior of cylindrical shells with both variable thickness and variable curvature and doubly curved translational shells. Numerical results are examined in terms of accuracy and computer time.

The dimensions considered are the cross-sectional area of the legs and the transverse face distance of the tower mast. The interaction diagrams developed give an over-all picture of the effect of changes in dimensions of the leg area or face distance on the critical design stresses and span deflections for the tower. The design method is illustrated by the design of an 1,100-ft guyed television tower.

AB - The work of the Task Committee on Factors of Safety, ASCE, to date (as of 1965) is summarized with a brief review of the work that has been done elsewhere in the field of structural reliability. On the basis of the assumption that the resisting strength of and the load applied to a structure are usually random variables, the probability of failure and reliability function are introduced as possible measures of structural safety, and related to the conventional safety factor. Reliability functions of structures consisting of multiple members are derived for the cases when the loads are applied at equal intervals or at prescribed instants and where the number of occurrences of the load is governed by a Poisson law, assuming that the resistance of the structure is either deterministic or random. Two numerical examples dealing with safety of a transmission tower and of an aircraft wing are presented to illustrate the proposed method of evaluation of structural safety.

Two pretensioned and two post-tensioned girders were subjected to repeated loads and were tested to failure. One girder of each type, designed for concrete tension of approximately 800 psi, was cracked under service loads throughout the test period. The other two girders, designed for a tension of approximately 300 psi, were subjected to repeated loads incremented beyond the service load level until cracks were formed. Only the post-tensioned girder designed for 800 psi tension suffered damage from the repeated loading. The results from the laboratory investigation of the full-size girders are in agreement with findings from the AASHO Road Test bridge research.

Reinforcement requirements were determined for the first model by a folded plate analysis based on the elasticity method and requirements for the second model were determined by the elementary beam theory. Experimental results through the elastic, inelastic, and ultimate ranges are examined and compared with theoretical predictions. Both models exhibited similar behavior and both sustained ultimate loads equal to four and one-half times the design load.

By using this concept, the natural fundamental frequency of vibration of uniform and variable stiffness members of any number of spans, may be accurately determined by solving a dynamically equivalent system. The dynamically equivalent system is a part of one of the spans of the original member with its end conditions properly satisfied. The method is general and known structural and vibration principles are used in its development. It could be easily extended to other types of structural problems.

AB - An investigation of the behavior of diagonally-loaded square infilled frames is described first. Series of experiments on diagonally-loaded models with a range of frame stiffnesses indicated that a small increase in frame stiffness has a magnified effect on the over-all stiffness and strength of the structure. Approximate theoretical analyses, based on the length of contact between the frame and infill, are developed to explain this composite behavior, and to provide methods of predicting the over-all diagonal stiffness and strength. The behavior of laterally-loaded infilled frames is considered next. The methods proposed for the diagonally-loaded case are adapted to predict the lateral stiffness and strength of single or multi-story square infilled frames. The results of experiments on single and double-story models support the pro-posed methods of prediction.

The concept of the modified elastic structure is introduced tor incremental loading stages where hinges of zero moment are assumed at the yield hinges located by the previous phase of the successive elastic moment distributions. Structures having sections with ideal elastic-plastic behavior, or where this behavior is a conservative assumption of the actual structural behavior, can be designed by the method presented.
