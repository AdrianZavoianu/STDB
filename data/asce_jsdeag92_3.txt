AB - The general problem of the effect of strain hardening on the elastic-plastic failure loads of plane structural frameworks is considered. A general computer analysis is described that enables a full examination of the problem to be made. Some results of this analysis are presented, and a comparison with the large-scale test results of earlier authors is made. It appears that the rigid-plastic-rigid theory suggested by Horne is inadequate when applied to more complex structures than those considered in his initial investigations. In the absence of any method of taking account of the effects of strain hardening and frame instability in a simple plastic analysis, it is concluded that the computer approach provides the only rational solution to the problem.

AB - Formulas are presented for determining the inelastic buckling strength of columns, plates in compression and in shear, I-beams and channel section beams, and rectangular beams. In each case, the buckling formula is a straight line that depends on the yield strength, the modulus of elasticity, and the shape of the stress-strain curve. The buckling formulas for the various types of members are found to be in good agreement with the results of tests and analytical studies. Experimental results included are confined to aluminum. Analytical considerations indicate the proposed formulas may be applicable to other materials with similar stress-strain characteristics.

A method is outlined whereby the theoretical plate buckling load of plain and lipped channel sections are obtained from the individual buckling characteristics of the web and flange plates. It is shown that good agreement is obtained between these theoretical loads and the corresponding experimental values obtained by the author.

AB - A method originally developed by Jenkins for considering the interaction of cylindrical shells with straight edge beams is extended to the case of doubly curved translational or rotational shells with curved edge beams. The method considers extensional, flexural and torsional effects in the beam. The intersection between shell and beam is not assumed to be at the beam axis. Action and displacement functions along the shell edge must be expanded into sine and cosine series. Two alternative derivations of the beam stiffness matrix are given.

AB - Investigation of a multimass model consisting of a cantilever with masses concentrated at floor levels and sections with varying moments of inertia between the floors, submitted at its base to a given ground-motion expressed by the time function f(t). For cases of actual buildings with shear walls, the shear deformation is also taken into account. The model is formed under the usual assumptions of masses lumped at floor levels, linear elastic material, no dumping, and uncoupled translations in two perpendicular directions. The shear-building assumption is dropped and the opposite assumption of no restraint by the floors on the rotation of vertical members, is made. A one-stage solution program is proposed, elaborated in matrix form, relying on extensive use of a proper analog and digital computers and leading to the determination of the maximal dynamic shear forces and bending moments produced in the vertical elements. A full numerical example of a nine-story hotel building with sinusoidal ground acceleration illustrates the method.

The experimental results of four compact joints, conducted to determine the bolt shear strength and the effect of variation in An/As ratio, and four long joints are presented. The variables covered in this investigation include pitch, joint length, and changes in the An/As ratio. Theoretical studios were carried out and the conclusions reached concerning the experimental variables are included. The present (1966) specification for all A490 bearing-type bolted short joints, awl the slip coefficient used for the design of friction-type joints are examined in relation to the test results.

AB - A mathematical model for computing the elastic deformational response of biaxially loaded columns of thin-walled open cross section is derived. The influence of residual stress and small initial deflections and twist are included in this model. The exact solution for this mathematical model is given. Several numerical examples are presented. Numerical values for stresses and deflections obtained from this solution are compared with the results of existing approximate solutions. It is demonstrated that initial imperfections may substantially reduce the limit of elastic behavior of biaxially loaded columns.

AB - A theorem of conjugate analogy is derived which generalizes the well-known conjugate beam method for bars, beams, and structures consisting of one-dimensional members of arbitrary shape (including curved bars) and with arbitrary supports, connections, and joints (including non-rigid ones). It also applies to thin-walled bars, for tension and shear, and for inelastic materials. It develops from the analogy between the geometry of small deformations and the equilibrium condition which is presented in vectorial integral form. This analogy permits the determination of deformations, deflection lines, influence lines, flexibility coefficients, as well as differential relations between deformations according to the equilibrium conditions of the conjugate structure which is obtained by replacing all supports and connections with their conjugates and loaded by conjugate loads (corresponding to curvature changes, extensions and shear angles at deformation).

AB - An operational method is developed to analyze plane multi-bay indeterminate pin-jointed trusses. Introducing the concept of the constituent bay or unit and defining a physical matrix, called the eigenmatrix, which is characteristic of the unit, a definite recurrence equation is obtained. The standard current eigenmatrix can be determined from boundary conditions at both ends of the truss. A typical numerical example proves the method to be effective. The method has been extended to more complex trusses involving skew, multi-storied, and three-dimensional ones. The method can avoid very large size inverses, and the only difficulty in it is that the operational matrices increase their size as the unit becomes complicated.

AB - The behavior at various stages of loading of a flat slab reinforced with welded wire fabric is described. The design was based on the empirical design method of ACI 318-56. The test structure was loaded at 16 points in each of its nine panels to simulate a uniform load. From three of a series of tests conducted at different load levels and with different combinations of loaded panels, representative load-deflection curves are given. At working load, the behavior of the structure was characterized by small deflections and stresses. The structure was essentially uncracked after reaching design load. Under increased loading, the stresses and deflections increased at an increasing rate as cracking progressed at failure at 955 psf. Comparison of the computer and design unit moments showed the structure to be adequately designed. However, the distribution of reinforcement was inefficient. The indication of the tests is that high-strength steel can be used efficiently and that the empirical method of design can be made simpler.

AB - The behavior of columns as components of a reinforced concrete framework under vertical loading and subject to sidesway has been studied analytically. Numerical solutions describing the behavior of approximately one thousand individual structural systems consisting of a column and its adjoining members have been obtained. Based on the resulting data, a study has been made into the effects of several variables known to influence the behavior and capacity of this type of structural system. The results of this study provide insight into the behavior and capacity of reinforced concrete columns subject to relative lateral displacements, and into the factors affecting this behavior and capacity. The variables considered were: relative lateral restraint, ratio of end eccentricities, eccentricity of load, slenderness ratio, relative end restraint and yield of end restraint.
