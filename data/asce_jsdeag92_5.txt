AB - An experimental investigation of collapse loads for transversely loaded mild steel circular-arc beams is described. The beams are built-in at their ends and subtend angles greater than 180?. It is shown that for single concentrated loads the collapse loads can be estimated closely by a theoretical analysis. The deflection criterion for collapse and in some cases strain hardening prevents the complete redistribution of moments necessary for the predicted mode of collapse. This incomplete redistribution of moments offsets to a great extent any increase in collapse load, over the predicted value, which might otherwise be expected as a result of strain hardening and the true nature of the interaction curve. A theoretical approach for estimating the collapse load for any aribtrary load distribution is shown to be satisfactory. The actual collapse loads are in every case slightly higher than the predicted values.

AB - A solution to the response of fully continuous orthogonal space frames supported on a viscoelastic soil media is presented. Matrix expressions containing slope-deflection equilibrium equations are used to formulate the structural problem in terms of joint rotations and elemental translations. The support reactions, derived in terms of the deformations, are incorporated into the equations of motion describing the consolidation of the soil mass. These expressions are written for mechanical models which are assumed to have viscoelastic characteristics analogous to the time-displacement properties of soils. Finite differences are used to reduce the differential equations of motion to linear algebraic forms such that a composite solution can be found when these expressions are substituted in the equilibrium equations. The methods of converting soil properties into equivalent viscoelastic mechanical model factors are examined and illustrative examples demonstrate the method.

AB - The complete load-deflection history of 18 beams tested during 1952-54 and 18 beams tested during 1959-61 at the Univ. of Ill. allowed a study of the factors which contribute to ductility. All tests involved simple spans with load applied through a column stub at midspan to simulate the beam-column connection in a reinforced concrete frame. This study involved only beams without axial load. Primary variables studied included depth, compression steel ratio, concrete strength, amount of transverse reinforcement, and ratio of compression steel area to tension steel area. The tests indicate clearly the contribution of compression steel to ductility of reinforced concrete beams. The modes of failure reflected the importance of confinement of concrete in the compression zone in insuring the capacity for large plastic rotation at the joint. In all cases the first crushing of concrete (∈c = 0.004), usually considered as ultimate, was found to be associated with a deflection much smaller than that corresponding to the ultimate load. For beams with compression steel the reverse ductility beyond first crushing was large, the deflection at ultimate load in some cases being more than ten times the first crushing deflection.

AB - Three beams tested at the Univ. of Ill. during 1959-61 were subjected to reversal in the direction of loading and 18 others were subjected to repeated loading in one direction. The behavior of the three beams subjected to reversal of loading is discussed in detail. The reduction in stiffness of a reinforced concrete beam with progressive damage resulting from repeated loading is examined. The three beams with reversal of loading were found to possess load-deflection capability similar to that for companion beams not subjected to reversal of loading. Envelope curves for companion beams show this comparison. Ultimate moment for the beams subjected to reversal of loading was found to be practically unaffected by the previous reversal of load in these tests. Some loss in ductility was observed, but large plastic rotation capacity was observed in all of these beams which were doubly reinforced.

AB - Use of stainless steel in structural applications is most economical in the form of light-gage members. In this type of construction, local buckling and post buckling strength is of major importance. Stainless steels are anisotropic, exhibit different shapes of stress-strain curves in tension and compression, are highly susceptible to cold work, and have low proportional limits. Because of the wide variation in properties this investigation is limited to Type 304, annealed and skin passed. Post buckling strength of stiffened, compressed plate elements is examined and experimental results are presented. The flexural strength and working load deflections of simply-supported hat section beams are calculated, using an effective width concept in the post buckling domain, and recognizing the nonlinearity of the stress-strain curves. Comparison with experimental results is given.

AB - All limit design theories are based on the principals of equilibrium of forces and compatibility of deformations at the state of impending collapse. Use of these theories is dependent on an ability to predict the moment rotation relationships of structural members. An investigation was carried out to improve on the accuracy of methods for predicting moment-rotation relationships of reinforced concrete beams. Tests on 40 beams are reported. In addition, the results of these tests and of tests previously reported on 37 beams are analyzed. The variables considered include size, beam width, reinforcement index, and binding by closed stirrups. A method is proposed for the computation of the rotational capacity of hinging regions in reinforced concrete beams.

AB - Experimental elastic stresses were determined from tests of simply supported wide-flange beams that had circular and rectangular web holes located at ratios of nominal bending stress to nominal shear stress ranging from infinity to zero, and were compared with stresses calculated by the theory of elasticity and by the Vierendeel method. For circular and rectangular holes not exceeding half the web depth, the elasticity analysis accurately predicts the tangential verse cross sections in the vicinity of the hole, but not the octahedral shear stresses at locations other than the hole boundary. For rectangular holes not exceeding the web depth, the Vierendeel analysis predicts the bending stresses on transverse cross sections with reasonable accuracy and predicts the octahedral shear stress conservatively but does not predict the stress concentrations at the hole corners.

AB - Simplified methods based on buckling strength are developed for proportioning stiffening lips on thin flanges and intermediate stiffeners on thin sheet subjected to uniform compression. Symmetrical and unsymmetrical stiffeners and lips are considered. Buckling strengths are determined from the equivalent slenderness ratio formulas presented and column buckling equations. The radius of gyration of stiffener or lip required to provide essentially a hinge support for the flange or sheet at the stiffener is developed. Compression tests of thingage hat sections of aluminum alloy 6061-T6 provide information on the buckling strength and behavior of sections with lipped flanges. These and other previously published test data substantiate the equations developed for buckling of lipped flanges.

AB - Shear distortion associated with deformations of trussed web systems in guyed towers can be sufficiently important to warrant consideration in design. Shear distortion reduces the stiffness of the tower shaft. If this reduction is ignored, and axial thrust is negligible, the resulting moments and shears are usually overstated; when axial thrust is sufficiently large to cause significant beam-column effects, the reverse is true. The shear effect is expressed by a shear-flexure parameter. Equations are derived for modifying the elastic constant, i.e., (stiffness and cary-over factors and fixed-end moments) used in the various techniques which evaluate end moments by release of restraints. Expressions are also given for evaluating in-span bending moments and shears. Results are given in chart form for special design use, and numerical examples are presented.

AB - The fully-stressed method is used to optimize structures whose members are subjected to bending, such as beams and frames, under the action of alternative load systems. In a fully-stressed design, at every section the section modulus is chosen so that the maximum allowable stress is reached under at least one of the alternative load systems. For statically indeterminate structures, the technique adopted for achieving the design criterion is iterative in nature. The forces and moments in the structure are adjusted to satisfy the conditions of equilibrium between the external and internal forces and at the same time satisfy fully-stressed condition. A mathematical statement of the design problem is presented for the case of a two-span indeterminate beam under alternative load systems. A sample problem illustrates the application of the method to obtain an optimum design of the indeterminate beam. Also, the procedure is outlined for obtaining a fully-stressed design of an indeterminate portal frame.

AB - For a single load system, Michell has proposed a deformation criterion which a framework must satisfy if it is to be of minimum volume. The criterion is that the members of the optimum framework to equilibrate a given force system must all be strained by the same amount, the sign depending on the sign of the axial stress carried by the member. A general class of frames, satisfying the Michell condition of strain, consists of those whose bars, before and after deformation, form curves of orthogonal systems. The two basic orthogonal curvilinear systems used in the development of the Michell optimum structures are the polar coordinate system and the equiangular spiral system. Optimum structures are developed for six different force systems. These consist of (1) self-equilibrating systems of concentrated forces that can be supported by a truss or a simple beam, and (2) self-equilibrating system of forces and couples that can be supported by a cantilever beam or a prismatic beam with fixed ends.
