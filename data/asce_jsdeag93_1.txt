AB - The ponding problem as characterized by the fact that the magnitude of loads is dependent on deflection is formulated. The governing differential equations for beams and plates are derived and solved for various boundary conditions. As a stability problem, the critical ponding ratios are determined. Also, magnification factors for deflection are found for beams and plates with ponding ratios less than the critical. A direct analogy between the steady state forced vibrations and the ponding problem is presented. Results of analysis are discussed and are shown to provide a rational basis for design.

AB - Circular bins are structurally efficient in containing bulk solids provided the load on the bin is axially symmetrical. This requires the axis of symmetry of the bin to be vertical, and both charge into the bin and draw from the bin to be symmetrical with respect to the axis. With these conditions satisfied, the pressure from the stored solid on the bin is uniform, the resultant circumferential stresses in the bin are tensile, and the bin can be constructed as a light shell. Disturbance of the symmetry introduces bending moments in the shell and may cause denting of the walls. In steel construction, these dents are usually more unsightly than dangerous, because the plastic denting causes a redistribution of stresses which tends to relieve the bending moments. A light steel shell which dented under eccentric draw is analyzed. A formula which determines the maximum permissible radius of bin with eccentric outlets is proposed. The formula applies only to free-flowing bulk solids.

AB - In hybrid beams, web yielding caused by bending may occur at design loadings and reduce the ability of the beam to resist web crippling under concentrated transverse loads, such as wheel loads in bridges. A brief theoretical consideration of this behavior is presented, and two tests are described. In one test a transverse compressive load was applied to the tension flange, and in the other test a transverse compressive load was applied to the compression flange. The tests showed that crippling loads equal to or greater than the nominal yield load—that is, the yield point of the web steel times the bearing length of the load times the web thickness—can be applied to either the tension or compression flange of a hybrid beam, even when the longitudinal stress in the flange is close to the yield strength of the flange. The tests also showed that the moment capacity of a hybrid beam is slightly reduced by a crippling load applied to either flange, but that the reduction is small enough to be neglected in design.

AB - The behavior of concrete in biaxial compression is briefly described as determined from experiments performed on six mixes by a testing machine capable of loading concrete slabs simultaneously in two orthogonal directions. Strain readings in the three principal directions, microcracking, and ultimate load were observed and measured for various values of lateral load on specimens from each mix. The results show that the elastic parameters, the load at which microcracking occurs, and the ultimate load are not constant but are dependent on the value of the lateral load. The effect of varying the aggregate size, water-cement ratio, and aggregate-cement ratio was also studied; these were shown to have a considerable influence on the properties of concrete in biaxial compression.

The method can be used to analyze for both the elastic and inelastic response of such columns provided that the material properties are known. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the application of the method.

AB - Most civil engineering structural problems are characterized not by a single random resistance subjected to a single random load, but by a complicated structural system exhibiting a number of mutually dependent modes acted on by a sequence of mutually dependent random loads. The task of determining the reliability of such a system under these conditions would be extremely difficult even if the necessary joint distribution functions were known. It is possible, however, to determine, with relative ease, bounds on the system reliability. One or the other of these bounds may also serve as an approximation to the desired reliability if the conditions leading to its derivation bold. In particular, it is likely that in many civil engineering situations the conditions are more nearly those of perfect dependence among modal failure events than perfect independence as is often assumed. In this case, a system reliability approximation is most readily obtained. The bounds are derived for general conditions of modal resistance and load distribution including time-dependent cases. The results prove valuable in a qualitative sense by showing the effect of such factors as number of modes, length of design life, and probabilistic dependence among modal resistances and among successive loads on the reliability of the system as a whole.

A method of analysis is presented by means of which the development of a tensile crack in a concrete member can be studied quantitatively and conclusions can be formed concerning its stability. The assumptions on which the method is based are stated in general terms and specific examples are presented to illustrate the application of the method. Examples include the following cases: Flexural crack in an unreinforced beam; flexural crack in a reinforced beam; cracks originating in a zone of combined shear and moment in a reinforced beam; and cracks at the top fiber of prestressed concrete beams at transfer. The implications of the calculations are evaluated and a set of conclusions is presented concerning their significance.

Also, a lateral-load-distribution test indicated the two-way bending strength of this floor. A punching test and an erection test demonstrated the durability.

AB - Buckling capacities of rigid frames with nonuniform members are analyzed by a numerical method using divided segments. Fundamental and higher buckling loads and modes result from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix which is the product of a sidesway flexibility and a second-order stiffness matrix. The sidesway flexibility matrix is obtained directly from the shape of the rigid frame and the elastic properties of the segments. The second-order stiffness matrix is defined by the axial forces in the segments. The method is approximate in that the flexural stiffness coefficients of the segments are those for uniform sections and without axial forces. A computer and numerical examples are provided.

AB - Shear-resistant light-gage metal diaphragms, such as wall cladding, roof decking, and floor panels, often are connected directly to beams or columns of a steel framework. Using an energy approach, analytical methods are developed for predicting the buckling strength of individual diaphragm-braced I-section members in the plane of the diaphragm. Sixteen tests of centrally loaded double-column assemblies with diaphragm bracing on one or both flanges, and eight tests of double-beam assemblies with diaphragm bracing on the compression flange, give satisfactory agreement with theoretical results. Theory and test results both indicate that shear-resistant diaphragms can be effective in increasing the buckling load of slender columns and beams.

AB - A computational procedure is presented for computer analysis of continuous highway bridge girders with unlimited number of spans and variable moment of inertia with or without floor beams. The length of the girder is subdivided into many elements. Then, by using the Moment Area method of analysis, the influence lines for deflection, reactions, moment, and shear are determined. For automatic computation of impact effects, a new method is proposed which uses impact modified influence lines. The influence lines are then loaded with dead loads and standard AASHO live loads. The loading of influence lines with moving loads can be formulated as a mathematical programming problem consisting of optimization of the effects of moving loads subject to constraints and limitations between the spacing of axles and vehicles. The envelope of maximum, minimum, and absolute maximum effects are obtained and the stresses are determined. This computational procedure is programmed in ALGOL-60 Compiler for an 1107-Univac Digital Computer. A numerical example is presented.

Classical methods of computing the inclined cracking loads are reviewed and their relationship to current design criteria is noted. Two broad types of shear failure analyses are defined as (1) arch, truss, and frame analagies and (2) limit analysis mechanisms, and the limitations of the various methods are briefly examined. A general theoretical solution of the shear strength problem is briefly outlined which involves a numerical iterative procedure to determine the stress and strain field in a cracked reinforced concrete beam. Secondary cracks caused by slip and dowel action forces in the longitudinal bars transferring shear across the crack are described and their influence on the mechanism of failure is considered.

Changes should be made in design procedures and in the ways of describing properties data, and test methods should be developed to provide data pertinent to structural applications. Factors affecting material performance arising from shape and size, orientation of reinforcement, fatigue, environmental deterioration, and flammability, currently present problems to the design engineer. Properties data are now available from technical societies, manufacturers, and reference books on practice and design. The goals of the Task Committee are to indicate properties requirements for design; to point out major associated problem areas; and to encourage further development of tests and standards for describing properties.

AB - The paper examines the behavior of wide flange beams loaded into the inelastic range under moment gradient conditions. It is shown that loads in excess of the plastic moment can be expected and that lateral buckling is not as critical as previous studies had indicated. Frequently, local buckling is a controlling factor and this allows the rotation capacity to be determined. A theory based on local buckling has been used to show that the hinge angle that can be delivered is a constant, and a lower bound estimate of the hinge angle has been presented. Test results confirm the lower bound nature of the hinge angle theory, but there is a need for further tests to define the limits within which the theory is applicable. It is shown that a primary consequence of high shear forces is to reduce the rotation capacity of the beam.

AB - The cold work of forming results in large plastic strains in the corner elements of light gage cold-formed steel members. As a direct result of these plastic strains, the yield strength of corner elements may be increased to as much as 100% above the original yield strength of the material. These changes in materials properties may have a marked influence on the structural performance of members containing corners. An analytical method for predicting the yield strength of cold-formed corners is developed. The theoretical results compare well with test results of corners fabricated from nine different types of sheet steel. The method provides a rational approach for including the effects of cold-forming of corner elements in the design of light-gage steel members.

The average yield strength in a cold-formed section may be as much as 70% larger than that of the original, as-rolled sheet steel. These changes in properties are not distributed uniformly in the cross sections, being considerably larger in the corners than in the flats of light-gage members. However, the quantitative information obtained in this investigation permits more rational and economical design of many such members. Both the tensile and compressive properties of corners, flats, and full sections were determined in an extensive experimental investigation. A method is devised for determining the stress-strain characteristics of full sections from simple tensile coupon tests. These stress-strain properties are related analytically to the inelastic buckling of compact cold-formed columns, using a generalized form of Shanley's tangent modulus equation.

AB - A generalization of the complementary energy concept to structures with large deformations is presented. The proposed approach leads to a theorem for displacements as well as a theorem for compatibility. Self-straining is taken into consideration. The method is illustrated through applications to large deformations of trusses and plane curved bars.
