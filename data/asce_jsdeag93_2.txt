AB - The U. S. has 6% of the world's population, 35% of its gross domestic product, but is becoming one large junkyard. The Creative Architect is needed to combine Art and Science in designing Institutional Structures. Wood is and can continue to be a good material for use in building because it has been used for many years and its characteristics are well known. Wood has many artistic expressions and structural possibilities. The cooperation of everyone connected with the wood industry is necessary for efficient and aesthetic use of wood in Institutional Structures.

AB - From 1940 to 1965, use of softwood plywood increased from 1 billion to 13 billion sq ft, the increase being mostly in building construction. Major construction uses are sheathing and subflooring. Contributing factors were low in-place costs ($0.10 per sq ft for roof sheathing) through labor savings plus acceptance of plywood as an engineering material. An important engineering property of plywood is its ability to act as a shear diaphragm in bracing a building against lateral wind or seismic loads. This was first recognized through wall racking tests, and later extended to horizontal diaphragms by the development of tested design methods. These design methods are also used in analysis of folded plate construction. Interesting uses for plywood have been developed as gusset plates to splice lumber into moment-resisting joints. Applications include trussed rafters and rigid gable frames. The connections are commonly made with nails, or glue or both. More recent developments include the acceptance, based on extensive testing, of plywood for one-hour fire-rated floor and wall assemblies, for heavy-timber roof construction, and for fire-retardant treated roof assemblies.

AB - Imaginative application of basic and applied research into wood and plywood application has provided the designer with a series of related structural units involving plywood in combination with other materials. These plywood structural components—stressed skin panels, curved panels, folded plates, box beams—are designed according to sound engineering principles. They offer the architect and engineer considerable freedom in achieving striking and unusual architecture and at the same time staying within the bounds of efficient structural design. Design methods have been proven and published and are available upon request. Fabrication specifications have been established and an industry-wide inspection and laboratory testing program polices them. A chain of fabricators well scattered throughout the United States are reliable sources of factory produced units. Detailed information is available from Plywood Fabricator Service, 1119 A St., Tacoma, Washington 98401.

AB - Navy experience indicates that timber has a place as a competitive construction material in waterfront and harbor structures. The list of applications includes piers, quay walls, piling, fender systems, sea walls, anchorages, groins, marinas, heavy waterfront substructures, and marine terminals. The use of pressure-injected preservatives, notably creosote coal tar solutions, is the principal defense against decay and marine borers. Other chemicals and protective materials can be used to avoid destruction by fire and abrasion. Inherent physical strength properties and adaptability to structural framing, coupled with the application of new ideas, promise to maintain the competitive position of timber among construction materials used in the marine environment.

AB - Experience shows that pole-type buildings are as modern as any other light construction and, in most instances, more economical. Pole buildings are esthetically sound, easy to decorate or incorporate into any design, and are simply built. Use of poles allows the most economical and easy use of the clear-span design concept and assures durability of the structure under stress from all elements, including wind storm, soil abnormalities, insects and conditions of decay. Kinds of preservative used, standards which they meet, and methods of treatment as well as use of the treated product in the plan are explained as integral in acceptance of wood poles in modern building. Pole construction meets up-to-date requirements of model building codes, and when properly incorporated in the design, can help create a most modern, interesting, safe, and economical building.

AB - The reliability of wood as an engineering material depends on sound information and enlightened usage. Efficient structural design must recognize wood's unique structural properties and use them correctly. The way in which results of standard tests on wood arc transformed into safe working stresses for structural design is summarized, and the factor of safety is considered. Reference is made to the structural grading of wood, emphasizing the importance of variability, and how this is accounted for in both visual and machining grading. In designing with wood, the designer needs to know about such inherent properties as strength with or across the grain, and about the place of fastenings. Structural reliability of wood depends on sound construction standards and discriminating use.

AB - Lumber is a product with considerable variation in strength and appearance. The grading of such lumber cannot be done accurately except by those with considerable training and experience. Thus, the designer, specifier, and user must have some way to identify the product as to strength and/or appearance, or both. This is accomplished by grading lumber to regard to the characteristics of strength and appearance as well as size. To assure the integrity of such grading the American Lumber Standards Committee has been set up to establish standards as to size and quality and to police and enforce these standards.

AB - The production of glued laminated timbers for structural uses requires a high level of quality control in its manufacture. The U. S. Commercial Standard CS 253-63 was developed to provide a uniform method of quality control in the industry. This standard provides for quality control by procedural requirements for production, performance tests of the finished product, and visual inspection of the finished product. It also requires supervision of quality control by a central organization. The American Institute of Timber Construction provides the services of a central organization with its Inspection Bureau.

AB - Experience shows that randomized selection of plywood panels most likely to reflect the influence of improper manufacturing practices is a valid approach for checking the general level of production quality. Panels so selected, when tested and evaluated using laboratory procedures correlated with field exposure performance records, will provide assurance of a quality level that is adequate to satisfy end-use needs. The changing character of plywood uses, raw material, and manufacturing technology makes it necessary to constantly review test techniques and evaluative procedures to assure that their influence on quality is properly reflected in the finished product.

AB - Extensive research has been conducted on the two principal causes for wood cross tie replacement, abrasion from the tie plates, and tie splitting. Repeated laboratory loading tests correlated with service tests in track have shown that tie abrasion can be reduced 50% with tie plate fastenings and almost eliminated with tie pads. Research has shown that dowels are an effective means of controlling tie splitting and a dowel with much superior holding power compared to the fluted dowell has been developed. Design data has been obtained by laboratory and field tests to improve the economy in use of timber trestles, including the repeated load strength of pine and fir in bending and shear and of bolted bracing joints. Extensive research work on fire retardant coatings did not yield practical results. A proving ground project for protection of wood against termite attack has indicated the most effective treatments. Work has been done leading to performance acceptance test for freight car flooring.

AB - Stress concentrations in timber beams are of practical importance now that the glulam industry is producing large beams of diverse shapes. The finite element technique is reviewed to consider an orthotropic material and then used to calculate the stress distribution near the end of a simply supported beam and over the area of a shear test block. It is then shown that the non linear stress strain behavior of wood must be considered if the results are to be realistic in regions of high stress gradient. The finite element technique is further modified to include this non linear behavior but numerical calculations are almost meaningless because of the lack of stress-strain curves beyond the proportional limit. The technique thus points out what research is necessary in the laboratory before a realistic evaluation of beam strength is possible. It is shown how failure may be predicted with the finite element approach but again the analyst is confronted with a lack of experimental data on failure under combined stress. Finally, an experimental technique is outlined which may provide the required date and the results of several laboratory tests on the shear modulus are presented.

A class of structures is defined that includes some well-known large-span domes. It is shown that for these structures a highly significant decoupling of the stiffness equations is achieved by the use of finite Fourier series with vector coefficients. For certain kinds of loading the theory is extended to treat nonlinear elastic behavior, and computable criteria of elastic buckling are established.

Influence line ordinates or reactions for any loading for regular continuous beams are used as coefficients for computing the corresponding values for beams on elastic supports. This simplifies calculations and allows the method to be used in conjunction with existing influence line tables or existing programs for regular beams. Although the method is general, the time-saving equations presented are useful for two-span beams, three-span beams, and four-span beams.

AB - Structures which can be partitioned into a continuous series of sections in which each section is coupled to two adjacent sections have a tridiagonal band matrix as the stiffness matrix. The displacements and internal stresses of such a structure can be obtained by a recursion procedure. The largest matrix that must be inverted is equal to the largest number of coordinates at the region connecting two sections. The recursion procedure is useful when the analysis is conducted for a few loading conditions and when the number of coordinates at the regions connecting adjacent sections is small. When a structure has the form of a closed ring, it is not possible to number the coordinates so as to yield a tridiagonal band matrix in which all the connections between sections of the structure will contain a small number of coordinates. In such a case it is advantageous to combine the analysis by substructures and by recursion. Substructures are selected so that they are most readily analyzed by recursion.

AB - The aerodynamic causes of suspension bridge oscillations, i.e., vortex theory, flutter theory, and negative slope theory are examined. Thirteen factors to be considered in the design of a suspended span are listed. Frequencies of antisymmetrical and symmetrical modes of vertical oscillation are given and also a minimum frequency in torsional oscillation. Mathematical studies are confined to the suspended span. Seismic studies give a mean fundamental period for the suspended span of 4.5 sec (13.3 cpm) and peak to peak amplitudes as high as 1.0 in. under the influence of a brisk cross wind and heavy traffic. This period agrees well with the calculated period of 4.51 sec (13.31 cpm). Other periods are 2.05 sec (29.27 cpm) and 0.35 sec (171.42 cpm). The cantilever span of extremely stiff design shows a fundamental period of 0.26 sec (231 cpm). The elastic-inertia and aerodynamic characteristics of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge are found to be satisfactory.

AB - An analytical procedure is presented for determining displacements of elastic three-dimensional suspension structures subjected to static loads applied in any direction, to temperature change, and to support movement. The structures considered are composed of cables and compression members which are assumed incapable of resisting bending. The analytical method is valid regardless of the magnitude of the displacements. Large sets of simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations result from the analysis. Two methods are used for their solution: the method of continuity and an incremental load method. In the method of continuity the algebraic equations are transformed into nonlinear differential equations which are numerically integrated. In the incremental load method the loads are applied incrementally and the equations solved at each load level by means of an iterative technique. Both methods of solution were programmed for an electronic digital computer having a large storage capacity. These programs were used for numerical studies of isolated cables, counterstressed dual cable structures, and prestressed nets.

AB - Governing equations in the form of two, coupled, fourth-order partial differential equations are obtained from shallow shell theory. The equations are specialized for the hyperbolic paraboloid shell known as the umbrella and solved by the method of finite differences. Results are presented in chart form and compare deformations, bending moments, and normal forces in three umbrella shells, with respective functions in an equivalent flat plate. They indicate that (1) the umbrella shell deflects seven to eight times less than an equivalent flat plate, (2) small magnitude bending moments are present, and (3) middle surface forces are approximately 20% higher than the predictions of the membrane theory.

Results calculated by the theoretical analysis are compared with the available test results of box frames. The reduction factors for long columns for given portal frames as calculated by the theoretical analysis are then compared with those calculated by the formulas of ACI-63 Building Code.

AB - The elastic stability problems that develop when a concentrated load is applied to a frictionless joint of a framed triangulated dome were studied. They were found to be of two types: (1) bar stability problems; and (2) joint stability problems. The solutions to the first are given by the Euler critical load. The latter were investigated by developing a general expression for the axial deformation of any component member and by taking the vanishing of the first order variation of the total potential of the system as the criterion for equilibrium. The force-radial displacement relationship at the loaded joint was found to be nonlinear and the critical load was defined to be the maximum force the system can support before the loaded joint snaps-through. A general theory is proposed and two approaches to the solution, one iterative and the other involving a parabolic approximation, are presented. A method for checking the results from the snap-through problem against bar stability and against yielding, is also suggested.

AB - The behavior of eccentrically loaded wide-flange columns with initial curvature is studied. The flange elements of the column section are assumed to be thin in comparison with the depth of the section. The moment-curvature relationship based on this assumption is derived for an elastic-perfectly plastic material, and is subsequently extended to include the effect of initial curvature. The differential equation is solved by double integration and interaction curves are obtained with the aid of a suitable stability criterion. Semi-empirical equations are suggested to approximate these interaction curves, by which the strength of steel wide-flange columns with initial curvature can be accurately estimated. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the procedure of analysis.

AB - The system of shell membrane force-equilibrium equations expressed in terms of cartesian coordinates can be reduced to a single differential equation, called Pucher's equation, involving a stress function and the coordinate defining the elevation of the shell surface. A computer program which completely automates the solution of Pucher's equation is described. This program is restricted to the case where the loading is vertical and the projected shell boundary consists of straight line segments. Collatz's method is used to establish a system of difference equations. Results for an elliptic paraboloid of square plan and a paraboloid of revolution having a triangular boundary are compared with the exact solutions and show excellent agreement.

AB - Experimental results are presented for wind tunnel tests on a series of model cylinders of varying height-to-diameter ratio, where the cylinder is mounted on the floor of the tunnel in a significantly thick boundary layer. Cylinder heights were increased until no significant changed occurred in the pressure distribution on the flat top. Comparisons of results are made with existing literature and possible extrapolation of results to full scale are examined. Data for the two extreme cases of cylinder heights were analyzed numerically by use of a digital computer and equations for pressure distribution on the cylinder and flat top were obtained. The equations axe developed in a form most useful for subsequent shell stress and deformation analyses.

AB - The operation of overhead cranes in mill buildings may impose severe dynamic loads on the structure, particularly on single bent structures where transverse (lateral) forces from the travel of heavily loaded crane trolleys may cause undesirable sway of the boats in the immediate vicinity of the crane. The bracing provided between individual bents tends to distribute these forces to adjacent bays with an effectiveness that depends on the relative stiffness of the bents and of the bracing transmitting these forces. When attempting to find the exact distribution of the transmitted forces, the entire structure must be treated as a space frame. This entails prohibitively cumbersome calculations. A method is presented which, based on certain simplifying assumptions, offers a comparatively simple solution of the force distribution among the various bents by applying calculus of finite differences.

AB - A new, time-saving method of analysis for prismatic folded plates is presented. It is based on the exact theory which considers the two-way slab action and the deep-girder effect of the plates. Applying the rapidly converging iterations of this method until a practically exact solution is obtained, results in savings of at least 50% of the theoretically required amount of computations. For many common folded plate types, the savings amount to as much as 70%. The method is well suited for use with an electronic computer because the repeating, iterative steps of the analysis are easy to program. The method is especially suited for manual operation, because the maximum number of simultaneous equations involved is only n-1, where n means the number of plates of the system.
