AB - A method for determining the end moments and critical axial loads of continuous prismatic beam-columns is presented and illustrated by numerical examples. The method requires neither the solution of simultaneous equations nor iterative distribution and numerical procedures. General expressions are derived in terms of beam-column constants that are available. The numerical examples given show the application of the proposed method to a four-span continuous beam-column.

AB - A simple and efficient method of directly calculating the shakedown load of a framed structure is presented. The method does not require iteration or trial and error and is fundamentally different from previous approaches to the problem. The equations are developed in matrix form and are particularly suitable for automatic computation using an electronic digital computer. The method allows the calculation of the static collapse load as a special case. An allowance for frame instability may be made in either of the above calculations without significantly complicating the analysis. A computer program has been developed to perform this analysis and results obtained are considered.

AB - Inelasticity of wood in compression is started by buckling of the external fibers of the material. These fibers are laterally supported by the adjacent internal fibers and may be considered miniature Euler columns of unknown length. The fiber-column failure stress is derived using energy methods. This critical stress is found t be a function of the material compression modulus of elasticity, the transverse material tension strength, and the ratio of fiber diameter to lateral fiber deflection at buckling. Five wood species were tested in direct compression. Transverse tension coupon tests were performed on the same material. Good agreement was found to exist between theory and test results.

AB - Multispan suspension bridges can be exactly and conveniently analyzed by the writer's method, which was derived by means of finite difference calculus with due consideration to the flexure of towers. The method can be applied to bridges with any number of spans, irrespective of whether the cables rest on movable saddles or are anchored at tower tops. Results are shown of analyses made on a 5,000 m five-span bridge with a 1,500 m center span and on a 3,220 m four-span bridge, both tentatively designed for the crossing of the Inland Sea of Japan. The four-span bridge with a rigid A-frame center tower has considerable stiffness and other merits. Bridges of this type can be of great advantage if used at sites where the construction of a rigid A-frame center tower is feasible.

AB - The necessary and sufficient conditions for geometrical stability of plane truss constructions, either statically determinate, or indeterminate, are presented. The procedure of testing stability involves only the velocity analysis of rigid bodies. After removing the redundants (if any) and an additional reaction component, the structure becomes a mechanism having a single degree of freedom. Assign an arbitrary permissible velocity to a link of the mechanism. The velocities of a few points can be used as the criteria for stability. The coliaries of the criteria are given in terms of the instantaneous centers of the mechanism. Furthermore, the force systems that can be sustained by an unstable structure in its own original form are asserted. The concept of influence vectors is introduced. The dot product of a force vector and the appropriate influence vector of a quantity is equal to that amount of the quantity produced by the force. The procedure of testing stability can be used to establish influence vectors or influence-vectors diagrams for statically determinable quantities.

AB - A method for computing the elasto-plastic dynamic response of Timoshenko beams (i.e., effects of shear deformation and rotatory inertia included) is presented. The method uses a lumped parameter model. The effects of the interactions between bending moment and shear force on the yielding behavior are taken into account by a generalization of the plastic potential theory. Numerical remits obtained involved the following variables: the form of the interaction (yield) curve, support conditions, span length, and the web-thickness of the cross section. It is shown that the influence of shear deformation could be substantial even for beams of quite usual proportions.

AB - The feedback theory of oriented flow graphs for continuous beam systems is presented based on the slope deflection and the three-moment theorem. The graph of the beam system is developed by superimposing basic parametric building blocks—the stiffness and flexibility factors of system members. Solutions of angle changes and end-moments can be obtained directly by the inspection of branch paths through nodes in the graph without recourse to the mathematical equations. All external disturbances are treated as input sources. The angle changes and end moments are dependent output variables in the graphs.

The particular design features are enumerated, research needs are classified, and current research work is listed. The cited references concentrate primarily on the German literature. The principal need was shown to be the collection and classification of the available material on design and the need for more general economic studies.

AB - A rational procedure for the optimization, on a weight basis, of columns supported by tension ties is developed. The tension ties provide a degree of intermediate elastic support which renders these systems more efficient than simple tubular columns in regions of low structural index P/L2. Two different configurations are considered. The first has one intermediate support-plane, and is stable up to a compressive load at which the second buckling mode occurs. The second has three intermediate support-planes and remains stable up to a compressive load corresponding to the fourth mode shape. Results are presented in such a fashion that conditions under which tie supported columns are more efficient than simple columns are readily apparent, and such that all design parameters are obtainable with a minimum of computational effort. Examples are included. Results indicate that, in favorable circumstances, columns supported by tension ties may be constructed with approximately half the weight required for a simple column capable of transmitting the same load over the same distance.

Representations of truss structures of arbitrary configuration are constructed by summing element potential energies. Exploiting the principle of minimum potential energy, structural behavior is predicted by numerical minimization of the total potential energy of the assembled structure. Selected example applications are included, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in predicting large displacement behavior. Particular attention is given to elastic stabilityment behavior.

AB - The development of nonlinear stiffness relations for three-dimensional finite elements of an elastic continuum is considered. On the basis of linear displacement approximations, consistent finite element representations are formulated for geometrically nonlinear problems involving large displacements and large strains. General nonlinear stiffness relations are derived for compressible materials and for incompressible materials of the Mooney-Rivlin and neo-Hookean type. Stiffness relations for triangular plates, membranes, and straight bars are also derived. It is shown that the connection of elements into the assembled system can be accomplished by a series of group transformations. A simple example is provided to demonstrate parts of the theory.

AB - The power of a man-machine system for structural design is greatly enhanced if the engineer can conveniently define his own design processes to the computer. A general class of user-defined design procedures included within a timesharing version of the Structural Design Language (STRUDL) are examined. Problem-oriented languages are described for the specific tasks of interpreting a design code, selecting a suitably-proportioned section from a handbook of standard shapes, and checking selected members against the design code. Also, some internal system requirements included in STRUDL, which allow it to perform the processes the user has defined in an external language, are evaluated. Some of these characteristics allow the computer to interpret external languages and to generate the corresponding design programs for subsequent use by the engineer. Other system characteristics give these design programs access to the necessary design data. With these capabilities, the engineer can refer by symbolic names to any design data in the system and obtain their values for use in whatever design procedure he chooses. An example illustrates how user-defined processes for code checking and member selection may be flexibly combined with other Structural Design Language commands to form a sequence for the design of structural members.

AB - An exact moment distribution process suitable for the analysis of rigid frames, simple Vierendeel girders, and multistory buildings with coupled shear walls subjected to transverse loads is presented and three examples of application are fully considered. The method eliminates the problem of slow convergence of conventional moment distribution procedures. In addition, the effects of axial distortions in the structure are easily calculated with the proposed method. A slide rule or desk calculator are the only tools required for the application of this procedure. Also, in the tradition of Hardy Cross, moments are distributed on a paper layout of the frame for a better physical significance of the process.

A quite general method for determining the moment-curvature diagram for any material and most cross sections is described and used. A procedure for calculating the elastic and inelastic flexural deformations of a member subjected to linearly varying distributions of bending moment is presented. The solution of inelastic, statically indeterminate flexural systems, using successive linearizations is developed. Applications are made to structural systems of aluminum alloy flexural members, both with and without welds, demonstrating that in some cases the presence of welds can actually increase the ultimate strength of such a system.
