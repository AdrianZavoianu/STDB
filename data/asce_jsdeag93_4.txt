AB - The purpose, development, and contents of the Timber Construction Manual, prepared by the American Institute of Timber Construction, are evaluated. The First Edition of the Timber Construction Manual was published in March, 1966. Major divisions of the Manual include: physical and mechanical properties of wood; loads; design; fastenings and connections; timber designing, detailing and erection; reference data; and design specifications. The contents of each division are reviewed and example illustrations of graphical material contained in the Manual are presented. The AITC quality control and inspection program for structural glued laminated timber is also examined briefly.

AB - A generalized force-displacement analogy for discrete structural systems is presented in terms of general structural matrices. It is shown that the conjugate structure concepts arise strictly from static and kinematic considerations, and that they are direct consequences of the assumption of small rotations. It is also demonstrated that the force-displacement analogies are independent of the material properties of the structure and are applicable to elasto-plastic and nonlinearly elastic structures as well as linearly elastic structures. A final example problem is included which contains a derivation of a flexibility matrix for a three-dimensional bar composed of an elasto-plastic or nonlinearly elastic material. The analysis of a space frame constructed of such a material is outlined.

AB - Nonlinear behavior in structures is frequently encountered in practice, and poses considerable difficulties in the numerical solution of the governing equations. Iteration is the most powerful technique available for solving such problems. A technique is presented which enables iteration routines to be classified from the standpoint of their convergence characteristics. This is then compared with several other methods of solving nonlinear structures, and the reason why some behave better than others is deduced. The derivation and application of a powerful numerical tool has been devised, which is applied to the solution of a suspended cable truss. The results are compared with those obtained from a model truss experiment.

AB - Existing static and fatigue studies of welded and rolled cover-plated sections are summarized. Studies showed that the strain concentrations did not differ greatly from other fillet welds. The stress in the cover-plate nearly conformed to theoretical predictions (Mc/I) at a distance equal to the cover-plate width when an end weld was present and at twice the cover-plate width when no weld was present. Fatigue failure always occurred in the beam and not the weld. Also, the fatigue strength of end details with or without transverse end welds are about the same at any cycle life. Significant increases in life were only obtained when the end welds were machined or ground smooth. Finally, the application of existing studies to design is described and current (1966) design practice is scrutinized. Several design recommendations are suggested and areas requiring additional study are also summarized.

SO - Journal of the Structural Division 1967-08-01 93(4): 123-138
AB - The problem relates to the transient vibration of a single-span suspension bridge which is traversed by a constant force moving with constant velocity or a pulsating force moving with constant velocity. Damping is zero and there is no mass associated with the moving forces. Equations of motion are derived and solved. Solutions are obtained for the deflections and stresses of the truss and for the increase in horizontal component of cable tension. The theory is based on the deflection theory equations of suspension bridges. It is linearized by assuming that the increase in cable tension due to live load is small compared to the dead load cable tension. A numerical example illustrates the theory. The results of the example show large magnifications of stress (on the order of 2.70) when the moving pulsating force is driven at the frequency of the first symmetric mode. Also, in general, there is no appreciable dynamic effect associated with moving constant forces on long-span bridges. The dynamic effect of moving constant forces, however, becomes more pronounced on short-span bridges having a low frequency associated with the first asymmetric mode.

AB - The results of tests on 15 composite beams with cellular metal decking, and 39 push-out tests are described. The influence of rib geometry on the load-deflection characteristics of the beams and on the maximum strength of the push-out specimens is shown. There is considerable improvement in strength and stiffness over the non-composite beams. The mode of cracking of the concrete in the cellular deck is influenced by the dimensions of the ribs although all beams were able to sustain an increased load during increased deflection, after the cracking occurred. Three types of connector arrangements and three beam sizes were tested. None of these variations had any significant influence on the load-deflection characteristics of the composite beams. Tests with two high-strength steel I-beams showed an increased load capacity due primarily to the delay in occurrence of yield in the lower fibers, of the beams. The occurrence of first yielding under the load-points of a two-point load system appears in some instances to trigger off cracking of the concrete in the ribs of the deck.

Inelastic effects and local buckling are included. The optimization method, based on the structural index, provides a simple and efficient design procedure. Extensions of the method to include arbitrary nonoptimum dimensional limits are described. Practical design examples are included. Comparisons of the interaction method with other theories of eccentric column behavior are made.

AB - This report has been developed to provide more specific loading recommendations for steel transmission towers. Other features include design formulas for compression members, fabrication and testing recommendations, foundation nomenclature, survey information, and construction methods. The development of workable and tested compression formulas for angles based on the yield point of steel receives considerable attention. Compression formulas illustrated by curves are developed for both 36,000-psi and 50,000-psi yield steels. Examples are included showing slenderness ratio determination and allowable compressive stress for angles based on yield point. Angle width to thickness ratio is recognized in the development of the formulas. The effects of end connections is recognized in determining the slenderness ratio.
