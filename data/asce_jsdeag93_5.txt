AB - The post-buckling behavior of a circular thin-walled cylinder under axial load is analyzed with the aid of a geometric model which takes into account the undistorted ends. The analysis, which uses a variation of the total energy to define the equilibrium paths, is applicable to cylinders with slenderness ratios (R/t) greater than 100. Elastic and elastic-plastic ridge bending stresses assumed to be uncoupled from the membrane stress state are taken into account. Finally, sensitivity of buckling loads to imperfections with a proposed correlation with post-buckling modes is indicated.

AB - The paper describes a series of tests on 22 right circular metal cylinders loaded in axial compression. The experimental results are related to theoretical predictions of post-buckling suggested in an earlier paper using a geometrical model which includes elastic-plastic bending in a series of line hinges separating plane triangulated segments. Modifications to the model are suggested to provide for plastic axial strains at nodal points between the triangles and thus promote a better correlation between theory and experiment.

AB - A stress-strain relation of the Ramberg-Osgood type across a beam section has been shown to result in a Ramberg-Osgood moment-curvature function for the section. The plastic section modulus is found to be an important parameter for determining the characteristic moment parameter. Simple expressions are presented for finding the moment-curvature parameters (a) from the stress-strain parameters of the material, and (b) from the moment-curvature parameters of a section. Remarkable agreement exists between these simple expressions and the actual results.

AB - The deflection of statically-determinate, singly-reinforced concrete beams subjected to repeated cycles of sustained load is presented. A viscoelastic stress-strain law for the concrete in the beam was selected based upon observations made in experiments performed on plain concrete specimens. The equilibrium equation for the reinforced concrete beam indicated that the neutral axis location varies during creep; the result of this variation was to couple the equilibrium equations and make them nonlinear. An iterative procedure was developed for numerically solving the system of equations. The process is sufficiently general so that any form of the concrete stress-strain law could be included. Experiments were performed with six beams loaded with concentrated loads at the third points. The loading was applied to the beam in cycles ranging from 10 days to 30 days duration and then reviewed for the same period of time. Comparisons of the predicted central deflections were made with the observed values, and agreement was noted.

AB - The investigation of compression-membrane action in restrained slabs involves elasto-plastic analysis, including the effect of change in geometry during the deformation, followed by rigid-plastic solutions. This procedure leads to the predictions of the loading capacity, magnitude of the restraining forces, and the effects of the boundary conditions, the span to depth and reinforcement ratio. Underreinforced thin slabs are associated with geometrical instability, thick underreinforced slabs with plastic instability, and thick overreinforced slabs with compression failure. In thick slabs, the confined compressive stress leads to an improved loading capacity and modification of the definition of balanced reinforcement. In modified underreinforced slabs, low reinforcement ratios lead to tensile failure, while high ratios lead to initial compression failure followed by tensile failure. The restraint depth of an internal panel in multipanel slabs can be controlled by proper reinforcement design. This panel loses its restraint if surrounded by a slab strip width less than half the panel span, and is fully restrained if this width is more than twice the span.

AB - A bending analysis of hyperbolic cooling towers is presented. The equilibrium and compatibility conditions are defined in terms of the stress resultants and combined into a set of complex differential equations with variable coefficients. The system is then transformed in such a way that the variable coefficient may be approximated by a constant using order of magnitude arguments. The solution for harmonic n required for the treatment of wind load is considered, and the solutions for dead load and earthquake load can be obtained as special cases by taking n = 0 and n = 1, respectively. Values of the stress resultants due to dead load, earthquake load, and wind load are shown for a typical shell considering boundary conditions which closely approximate those found in actual construction. The effect of the variation of the shell parameters on the stress resultants is shown, and the stresses computed by means of both the membrane and bending theories are discussed from a design standpoint.

AB - Advances in the field of structural analysis should be accompanied by improved statistical methods of determining structural safety. The reliability or the probability of survival of the structure is used as a rational criterion for structural safety. Three methods including Monte Carlo simulation, numerical integration, and failure mode ordering are developed for computing the reliability of a structure with many members and load conditions described by frequency distributions. An elastic pinned end truss with thirteen members and two load conditions is analyzed. Investigation of different values of standard deviation for the load and strength distributions leads to a criterion for determining whether failure modes may be treated as statistically dependent or independent. The design of structures for a specified reliability is also discussed.

The three main variables were the splice length, the splice location, and the stirrup spacing over the splice length. The load-deflection curves are examined and compared with a similar unspliced specimen. Anchorage bond stresses are computed and compared with the provision of ACI 318-63. The results indicated that the ductility increased with the length of splice and with closer spacing of stirrups over the splice length. The ultimate anchorage bond stresses were on the average 28% higher than the code values for splices.

AB - The forces acting on the barrel of a rigid culvert due to the dead load of a high fill may depend on the construction method, the presence of organic material, the material of the earth's crust, the fill properties, and culvert geometries. These features are accounted for by the finite-element method for obtaining approximate solutions to plane problems of linear elasticity. The analytical methods are applied to an actual embankment over a rigid culvert, the barrel of which was instrumented with pressure meters. The analytical results for two conditions of the earth's crust, various fill properties, and for a hay block deliberately placed over the crown of the culvert are compared with the recorded pressures. It is concluded that given a proper description of the material properties, in particular the fill to hay modular ratio, an accurate distribution of barrel pressure may be obtained.

Kron, the theory is extended to allow for dissections of the given structure. A mixed method of analysis is developed and it is shown how various specializations of the resulting equations yield all the usual methods of structural analysis. Also, the mixed method equations, when solved by partitioning, give the above-mentioned piecewise methods, thus making it unnecessary to appeal to Householder's modification formula.

AB - Thin shell theory is used to derive a general method of treating folded plates continuous over columns, diaphragms or gables. In order to solve the simply-supported folded plate, a Levy type solution is assumed, restricting the exterior supports to rigid diaphragms. This is done following the Goldberg-Leve formulation or, alternatively, by resorting to a straight numerical integration of the resulting system of ordinary differential equations. Impulse loadings are then applied to the simply supported structure to provide influence coefficients for column reactions. Where transverse diaphragms or gables are used, the simply-supported folded plate is again the primary system and compatibility is achieved by collocation, using transversely distributed impulse functions and joint impulse forces to model the support reactions. Numerical examples for each type of support are included and the results compared with model studies and with results from other solution methods.

AB - The inelastic torsional buckling strength of axially loaded H-columns is studied. The influence of residual stresses on both the torsional and flexural buckling strength of structural steel members are examined. For inelastic torsional buckling, it was necessary for the residual stresses to satisfy one more equilibrium condition than those that are required for the consideration of flexural buckling. When this additional condition is imposed, the well-known reduction in elastic torsional buckling load due to the presence of residual stresses disappears. It was found that the torsional buckling strength depends not only upon the column dimensions, but also upon the yield stress level of the material.

The slab was 47 in. wide and either 4 in. or 6 in. thick. All beams had an ASTM A36 web but the flange was varied in steel type using ASTM A36, A441, and A514. All beams failed in the concrete slab at the studs. Those having an A514 flange failed at about 80% of the computed fully plastic flexural capacity of the beam but those with A36 and A441 flanges reached an essentially fully plastic state of stress.

The test track supported on steel stringers and columns is 9,360 ft long and required approximately 2,300 tons of ASTM A36 Steel. The stringers were designed and fabricated to follow the many horizontal and vertical curves, grades and superelevations purposely built into the system. The structure forms a test loop and carries electrically powered, computer controlled, lightweight transit cars which may operate through a given point at 2-min intervals. The cars are automatically steered by a continuous steel I-beam located midway between the two track stringers. The steel structure is supported at each column on single 5-ft or 6-ft diam reinforced concrete caissons drilled at least 10 ft into rock. An electronic computer was used in the development of the geometry and structural designs.

Various methods of solving the basic equations are discussed briefly. One method is discussed more fully, namely, that of using finite-difference equations with simultaneous equations and programmed for a digital computer. This computer program was applied to a selected number of both isotropic and orthotropic plates. Results of tests on small-scale isotropic and orthotropic plates are given. The test results are compared with results obtained from the computer program. The computer program is applied to an orthotropic plate bridge deck to determine the bending and membrane stresses caused by truck loads. Analytic and experimental results are summarized and pertinent conclusions are drawn concerning the appearance and magnitude of membrane stresses in plates.

AB - The results of an analytical study of hybrid steel bolted joints of A36, A440, and A514 steel are presented. The joints were fastened by either A325 or A490 bolts. The studies were designed to determine the effect of variables on the joint strength. The major variables studied were joint length and the ratio of the net plate area, An, to the total fastener shear area, As. The studies indicated that the average shear strength of hybrid joints was equal or greater than the average shear strength of homogeneous joints. Hybrid joints behaved similarly to homogeneous joints in that as the joint length was increased, the average shear strength decreased. Also, a decrease in An/As ratio in hybrid joints was accompanied by the decrease in average shear strength experienced with homogeneous joints. Currently used (1966) design stresses were examined and it was demonstrated that increasing allowable stresses in both A325 and A490 bolts would have little effect on the minimum factor of safety in bearing-type connection.

Brittle coating, mechanical and electrical strain gages, and photoelasticity were used for the analysis. An epoxy model was loaded at room temperature to obtain brittle coating and strain gage data. The model was then heated to the critical temperature of the epoxy, loaded, and cooled to room temperature to freeze-in deformations and a photoelastic pattern. Slices were cut from the frozen model for analysis. Principal stresses have been evaluated along the longitudinal and transverse axes through the hole, and along a line at 45° to the axes and through the hole, and on the hole boundary. Both fields of isobars on the outer surface are reported. Comparison with a theoretical development for a similar case showed some stress variations of the order of 25% near the hole. From the different methods used in the experimental work it was felt that the combination of photoelasticity and brittle coating is most suitable to determine the state of stress at inner and outer surfaces of a shell.

AB - The network formulation of structural analysis, applicable to all linear, elastic bar systems for homogeneous structures, has been extended to include the effects of local static releases and/or local kinematic constraints both on members and on joints. Procedures have been described for the stiffness as well as for the flexibility method. The functional properties of all procedures within the total formulation have been classified; and use has been made of the dualities between corresponding procedures in the flexibility and in the stiffness method. The extended formulation of structural analysis maintains the simplicity and generality of the network formulation. This not only leads to a concise and clearly structured formulation of the theory, but also allows for efficient and general digital computer programming of these procedures.

AB - The analysis of continuous arch frames with curved members of constant cross-section and either circular, parabolic or semi-elliptic arch form by means of an extension of the slope deflection method is presented. The slope deflection equations for curved members in general are first introduced. Coefficients that appear in these equations are then calculated for a wide range of arch rise/span ratios for the arch forms mentioned above. Numerical example is given to illustrate the application of the proposed method. The results agree closely with those obtained by an approximate method.

AB - The deformation of a structure is defined to be homologous if a given geometrical relation holds for a given number of structural points, before, during, and after the deformation. Applied to radio telescopes, the task is to find a structure where the gravitational deformations of the surface, when tilted, transform one paraboloid of revolution into another one, yielding an exactly focussing mirror for any angle of tilt. A mathematical method is presented for obtaining homology solutions, in terms of the bar areas of all members, for any telescope structure with given geometrical shape. The method is linearized and iterative; it uses the notations of linear algebra. Finally, a two-gradient method is suggested for obtaining that homology solution which fulfils all external load conditions with a minimum amount of total weight.

AB - A wind load analysis of hyperbolic cooling towers based on membrane theory is presented. The solutions of the governing differential equations for the first two harmonics, n = 0 and n = 1, are obtained by quadrature, while the solutions for the higher harmonics, n &gt; 1, are obtained by means of an approximate integration technique. The stress resultants and displacements are derived in closed form. The stress resultants and displacements due to an experimentally determined wind load are compared to those caused by a simplified wind load. The maximum values of the stress resultants and displacements are tabulated against a wide range of shell parameters to facilitate the design of such structures.

AB - The calculation of the tilt and deflections of a tapered tower with variable circular or polygonal cross section can be reduced to the analysis of a cylinder subjected to the same loading. Compensating factors consider the increase in stiffness of a polygon over that of its inscribed circle and the change in compliance resulting from the taper of the tower and the variable wall thickness. The change in wall thickness can be linear, concave or convex and is governed by an exponent n that produces the transition shape. The compliance factors are derived by solving the tedious integrations by numerical methods on a digital computer. All formulas needed for the practical analysis are collected on a data sheet that precedes the eleven graphs containing the ψ factors for a linear transition. The last graph shows the compliance as a function of the shape exponent n.

AB - Full size cast-in-place reinforced concrete beam-column joints representing a critical portion of a multistory building were tested under simulated earthquake loading. Six of the specimens tested represented an exterior joint unconfined by spandrel beams. A seventh specimen had short unloaded spandrels on each side of the joint. Test variables were column size, column axial load, and amount of joint lateral reinforcement. Reversible elastic and plastic load cycles were applied to each specimen to simulate earthquake loads. Suitability of recommended reinforcing details for use in earthquake resistant design was verified by test results. Specifically, closed rectangular hoops surrounding the joint were shown to be essestial in developing ductility and maintaining strength of isolated joints in structural frames. Energy absorption required in building frames subjected to earthquakes was demonstrated to be amply provided by a properly designed reinforced concrete frame.

AB - The method presented is a modification of the deflection theory and is based on the recognition of each individual suspender with its tension and stretch, and the horizontal displacements of the cable panel points. The procedure, adapted to electronic computers, deals with the solution of problems for suspension bridges with simply supported trusses. It simplifies the study of secondary effects such as suspender inclination together with the resulting variation to the horizontal component of the cable tension, variable moment of inertia along the truss, the truss shear, elongation of suspenders, and tower motion.
