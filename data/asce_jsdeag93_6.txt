AB - The writing of efficient methods of solving simultaneous equations which result from a linear structural analysis of large frameworks is discussed. Gaussian elimination is considered, and numerous computational variations based on this method are developed. Each method is written to take advantage of some or all of the properties of the stiffness matrix. The solution routines, classed into two distinct groups, use either magnetic tape or need only the working store. The magnetic tape program involves matrix partitioning which is performed internally by the computer. Two methods of solution are based on single coefficient eliminations and two are based on the simultaneous elimination of groups of coefficients in the form of submatrix stiffness blocks. Comparisons are made between various methods, and rules are formulated which will permit automatic selection of the appropriate solution routine for a given problem.

AB - A theoretical investigation of the shakedown theorem for non-prismatic beams of elastic-plastic and strain-hardening material is presented. Analytical expressions for shakedown analysis of continuous beams with variable cross section under statical loading have been derived. The effect of preload, shear force, and geometry of the section on the shakedown load has been treated. A new concept of shakedown analysis of continuous bridges, prismatic and nonprismatic, has been introduced. The method is directly applicable for shakedown analysis of beams supporting crane runway girders, columns, and walls subjected to severe wind load. The shakedown method of analysis for both the stationary and travelling type of variable repeated loading has been illustrated by numerical examples of beams and bridges.

AB - The results of the linear response of eight actual chimneys to accelerograms of three actual earthquakes are presented. These results are correlated with values obtained using certain simplified rules that can be adapted to design office procedures. Curves are given which can be used in designing earthquake resistant chimneys. The ratio of the maximum base shear to total weight is plotted against the first-mode period. Other curves would give the values of the bending moments in the chimney by distributing the base shear according to any one of three arbitrary rules described in the paper.

AB - An iterative buckling analysis is formulated, using matrix methods and finite elements. Examples are presented of column analyses that use both the force and displacement methods of structural analysis. The analysis procedure appears to be suitable for programming on the digital computer. Elastic boundary conditions and irregular geometry and structural properties enter the formulation easily and naturally. The procedure requires no special derivations of elements and only one linear analysis of the structure. The results of the linear analysis are utilized to form an eigenvalue problem that is solved for the buckling load. The procedure appears applicable to more complicated problems than the examples, such as plate buckling or local crippling.

AB - Prestressing is shown to be an effective means of increasing the yield load, the ultimate load, and the load producing the allowable steel stress, in composite beams of steel and concrete, but prestressing of these structures does not significantly reduce the deflection due to live load nor does it significantly increase the load producing the allowable concrete stress. These conclusions are based upon the analysis of the behavior of a number of prestressed and conventional composite beams for both bridges and buildings, for loads increasing up to failure of the beam. The validity of the method of analysis is shown by analyzing certain beams tested by others and comparing analytical and experimental results.

Zonal linearization of the nonlinear relationship between unit weight and plastic-moment capacity of standard rolled shapes allows linear programming. Convergence to a minimum-weight design by considering a limited number of feasible solutions is discussed.

AB - An analytical method is developed for calculating the reactions and stresses in a single span circular-arc I-type girder curved in a horizontal plane. Mathematical expressions for the elastic curve are derived, based on an extension of the Timoshenko theory for nonuniform torsion. Both concentrated and uniform load conditions are presented. Formulas are provided for computing the deflection and angle of twist, as well as for the flange moments and shears resulting from warping restraint. The method considers the various end conditions encountered in practice, including the free-end or cantilever case. Two examples are included.

AB - A general method is presented by which multibeam bridges of channel section can be analyzed. The method is based on the assumption that the shear key, which connects individual beam elements, acts as a hinge. The beam elements are assumed to be free to rotate at the hinge, but no relative displacements in the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical directions are permitted at the hinges. The loads are assumed to be concentrated. The joint forces are represented by Fourier series which, in general, do not converge. A method is presented for interpreting these series and obtaining accurate numerical results. Numerical examples are included to show the variation of joint forces along the span.

AB - The choice of an optimum level of structural safety for one type of failure is formulated on the basis of the minimum expected loss criterion applied to an idealized basic scheme. Limits of sensitivity to initial costs are introduced and shown to lead to limits on sensitivity to failure probability. A rigorous decision is compared to an approximate criterion based on effectively zero failure probability for a variety of cases. In many practical situations the simple criterion is at worst a slightly conservative approximation to the formal solution.

AB - The effect of difference in thickness of the main plates in a joint bolted with high tensile bolts has been investigated for 1-in. plates joined to a 7/8-in. and a 15/16-in. plate, respectively. The efficiency in resisting slip is reduced with increasing the difference of main-plate thickness. The number of rows of bolts and the distance of the first row from the edge of the thinner plate are significant factors which may be used to restore to some extent such loss in efficiency.
