AB - Experimental results are presented showing the effect on ultimate moment capacity at sections of a wide-flange beam weakened by large web openings. Parameters investigated include the opening shape, the ratio of moment to shear at the openings, and the effect of adjacent openings at various spacings. Tests were carried out on 8WF17 beams with circular, rectangular and flat sided openings with semicircular ends. The results show that large reductions in capacity can occur and that these increase with the amount of shear present. An identical adjacent opening does not have much influence on the strength of a circular opening, but significant reductions in strength of a rectangular opening can be produced by a second opening.

AB - With the aid of an electronic computer, exact moment curvature M-φ relations are obtained for a wide range of eccentricities and prestressed steel ratios. Ultimate moments and ultimate curvatures are defined on the basis of limiting strains. Yield moments and yield curvatures are defined on the basis of yielding of the steel. These M-φ curves are idealized in sequence by three models: (1) pseudo elastic-perfectly plastic, (2) bilinear elastic-strain-hardening, and (3) an empirical expression representing partly linear and partly nonlinear characteristic closely representing the actual M-φ curve. Using the M-φ relations, a systematic historical analysis of continuous prestressed concrete beams is presented. The effect of secondary moments due to prestress is considered.

AB - An integral equation method is developed for the analysis of thin elastic plates. The integral equations are based on a Green's formula and are adapted for the solution of the biharmonic problem of plate analysis. By means of this method, a numerical solution is obtained for a simply-supported, uniformly loaded corner plate. Deflections and bending moments along the diagonal and shear forces along the edges are found. Values of these quantities previously calculated by means of a finite difference technique for a right-angled plate are confirmed by this new method and the analysis is extended to corner plates with different angles at the corner. Furthermore, for a right-angled corner plate, detailed contour plots of bending and twisting moments inside the plate are presented. With a digital computer these results are obtained without undue difficulty, and it appears that the integral equation method is well suited to this type of problem.

AB - A method is presented for foundation design with the aid of extrema envelopes of moments, shear forces, reactions and angular distortions, derived by computer calculation of all essential load states and soil-properties-scatter alternatives. The approach is based on the realization that subgrade conditions can never be known in enough detail to justify a calculation based on a single assumption regarding the soil properties, and that it is more reasonable to consider as many as possible of the likely combinations of subgrade properties scatter and load states. The method is illustrated on a four-span beam on single footings, but it is general and applicable to other systems as well.

AB - The continuous connection method of analysis of coupled shear walls assumes that the discrete system of connections, formed by lintel beams or floor slabs, may be replaced by an equivalent continuous medium. By assuming that all cross-beams have a point of contraflexure at midspan, the behavior of the system may be expressed as a single second-order differential equation, enabling a general closed solution to the problem to be obtained. The writers have extended the technique to include shearing deformations of the walls. By comparing the theoretical values of both stresses and deflections with the results from a series of tests on model walls perforated with one or two bands of openings, it is shown that the influence of the shearing deformations in the walls is much less than that of the flexibility of the joints between the walls and connecting beams.

As a result, the unrestricted expressions of the critical load capacities of such built up columns with various end conditions are given, which are found to be computationally superior to available approximate solutions. The solutions developed are general in that they can be applied to investigate the load capacities of similar multiredundant structural frames free of geometrical restrictions pertaining to the ratio of height to width.

AB - The reinforcing bar splicing technique investigated herein is the cement grout sleeve splice which has previously shown good structural characteristics in resisting static loads. The unanswered question concerning its reaction to repeated loads stimulated this investigation. The slip characteristics of cement grout sleeve splices subjected to repetitive loadings are investigated in this test program. Reinforcing bar sizes 8 through 11 were tested at splice imbedment lengths of 5 in. Each splice was subjected to 75,000 repetitions of load. These consisted of 25,000 repetitions of load at each of the reinforcing bar tensile stress levels of 20,000, 30,000, and 40,000 psi. The slip of sleeve splices should definitely be considered if the splices are to be subjected to repetitive loading.

AB - Influence surfaces are valuable aids for the computation of moments in plates caused by concentrated loads. The influence surfaces presented in this paper have been drawn from influence coefficients computed by a numerical procedure coded for a digital computer. Four moment locations are considered in the interior panel of a continuous structure composed of nine square panels arranged three by three and supported along the edges by flexible beams which in turn are supported at their intersections by rigid columns. When the supporting beams have zero flexural and torsional stiffness, the nine-panel structure is representative of a plate supported by rigid columns at the corners of each panel. When the beams are considered to have stiffness, the structure analyzed is representative of a plate continuous on all four edges and supported on deflecting beams and rigid columns at the corners. The accuracy of the computations was checked by comparing the computer results with those obtained by a more exact method of solution. The comparison shows that the finite difference method rounds off discontinuities which occur in the more exact solution. However, a comparison of values from the two methods at some distance from a discontinuity show there is no difference between them.

AB - A test of a single-story, single-bay frame was performed as part of a program to investigate the behavior of multistory frames. The frame consisted of two ASTM-A441 columns rigidly connected to an ASTM-A36 beam and was subjected to combined vertical and horizontal loads. The frame was so designed that the effect of secondary moments produced by axial forces acting through sway displacements could be observed experimentally. The test also furnished important information concerning the behavior of the high-strength steel columns. The experimental results are compared with predicted values obtained from an elastic-plastic analysis, which accounts for the secondary moments in the frame, the axial loads in the columns, and the increased strength provided by the beam-to-column connections. In addition, in predicting the post-mechanism behavior, the influence of strain hardening is included in a rational, yet simple manner. The theory developed closely predicts the response of the test frame.

AB - Conventional cracked reinforced concrete beam theory is extended to include general linear viscoelastic behavior of the matrix (concrete) material in compression. An analytical formulation is developed which leads to a single governing equation on the position of the neutral axis. Although it has not been possible to obtain a general closed solution, some important properties of the solution of this nonlinear, Volterra-type integral equation are established. The relationship of this theory to a popular approximate procedure, known as the effective modulus method, is discussed. The nonlinear integral equation is resolved numerically, and results are shown for several cases of interest.

AB - The response of multistory buildings to a class of nonstationary random excitation of earthquake type is obtained under the assumption that the building can be treated as a shear beam with damping properties that make the model analysis possible. Two different distributions of the shear rigidity along the height of the building are considered. The story rigidities ki are constant for Structure I, while, for Structure H, larger for lower stories is usually the case in reality. The variance of the story displacement is computed as the significant response. Moreover, the probability that a specified level of stresses in the columns of the building will be exceeded, is estimated at each story for a measure of safety. As expected, Structure II has a better design since each story has a similar probability of attaining the same level of stress. This suggests that the analysis of this type may be useful for comparison of the safeties of different structures subjected to the same loading.
