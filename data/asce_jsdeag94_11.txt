AB - This paper attempts to evaluate the various methods available for the solution of large sparse linear systems from the point of view of minimizing the computer time required for their execution. First, the more obvious classical methods are considered. These are then related to the work of Kron and the various substructure techniques. Finally, the theoretical aspects of optimum computation are discussed in the light of the practical aspects of the problems of machine computation.

AB - Layered systems of various materials are used to fabricate beams, plates and shells. The procedures commonly employed to analyze such systems are based on assumption of rigid interconnection between layers. In some widely used systems, however, this assumption is questionable. The basic phenomenon of interlayer slip is considered and a consistent theory for layered beams is developed. The results of experiments with layered wood beams connected with nails, with and without glued ends, are given. Excellent agreement with the general theory is shown. The importance of interlayer slip effect on the deflection of layered beams is demonstrated. The procedures developed can be used for any mechanically-connected beam system.

AB - A brief review is made of the mainly experimental work which has been carried out on shear diaphragms. To make full use of the shear properties of steel decks, it is desirable to be able to predict the behavior by calculation, and not rely entirely on full scale testing. A list is given of the factors which affect the shear behavior of practical panels of decking, and mathematical expressions are given or derived for each. It is shown that the total shear flexibility of a panel can be obtained by adding the separate effects, and that the shear strength of a panel can be calculated assuming that failure occurs because of tearing at the sheet fasteners. Experimental data on the slip characteristics of sheet fasteners and on the twisting characteristics of a range of purlin-rafter connections is given. The theoretical shear flexibility and strength of an experimental panel of sheeting is calculated and shown to be in close agreement with the measured values obtained from tests.

AB - A reanalysis procedure is given, which, for few structural changes, is a superposition procedure and for many changes is a rapidly converging approximate analysis method. The mathematical basis is defined for the procedure using the complementary energy approach. The results are summarized in applying the procedure to the multiple configuration analysis of trusses. The essential highlights of the paper are given in the summary.

AB - The influence of the flexibility of the foundation medium on the seismic response of a class of typical single-story structures is examined. The foundation medium is represented by an isotropic elastic half-space, while the ground acceleration is simulated by a transient time dependent function which exhibits characteristics resembling those of strong motion earthquakes. The solution of the equations of motion shows that the flexural displacement of an interaction system can be greater or less than the response of the same structure on a rigid foundation. On the basis of a parametric study, simple relationships are given which permit the use of spectral velocity curves for estimating the maximum flexural response of single-story structures on flexible foundations. The proposed technique yields, for both pseudo and actual strong motion earthquakes, results which are in good agreement with the maximum flexural response obtained from the solutions of the equations of motion.

AB - The results of experimental studies of constructional alloy (A514) steel butt plices fastened by A325 bolts are reported. Also included are the results of the experimental studies on hybrid steel joints fastened by A490 and A325 bolts. The test results are comparable to the theoretical studies on ultimate strength and the distribution of load among the fasteners. The slip coefficient of a grit-blasted steel faying surface is approximately 0.34. The use of higher allowable shear stresses for A325 and A490 bolts in bearing-type connections is found appropriate.
