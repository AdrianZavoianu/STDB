AB - Introductory remarks are made on the existence and importance of fatigue cracks and failure. In the absence of an all-encompassing theory, fatigue data are generated and analyzed from an engineering view point. Structural components are usually tested in laboratories under simulated service loading conditions or under constant stresses. Factors involved in investigations are materials, geometry of members and components, load magnitude and history, and environmental conditions. Stress magnitudes or stress ranges are related to failure through an S-N curve or a Modified Goodman Diagram for the interpretation of test results. Statistical analysis often is essential for the formulation of design rules.

AB - The behavior of a structure subjected to cyclic loads is dependent upon a number of details, either intentional or unintentional, which could be potential initiation sites. Since the over-all effect of such details on fatigue strength cannot be calculated accurately, design values have usually been based on laboratory data generated in tests of specimens that simulate the characteristic stress-raiser of the actual detail. The data from tests of butt- and fillet-welded joints, beam details, riveted and bolted joints in base materials of the common classes of structural steels are presented and analyzed. Details have a major influence on the fatigue behavior of structures because they result in: (1) localized increases in stress (above the nominal stress); and (2) residual stresses. The test data generated in the laboratory have provided a basis for establishment of allowable stresses and the development of proper design techniques to prevent fatigue failures in structures. In addition, methods have been developed to improve the fatigue strength of structures containing critical details by minimizing the stress concentration or favorably altering residual stresses, or both.

AB - This paper describes the need for acquisition of strain histories of actual bridge structures to establish the expected number and magnitudes of the load cycles. This is needed to assist in the selection of cycle lives and design stress levels. Several factors are described that affect the strain history. They include stress history, environment, and material conditions. Many of these factors have been studied in the laboratory under uniform cyclic loading. However, this does not forecast the service life of a structure with any confidence. The various types of service load simulations are described. They include block or programmed loading, random process generated loads, and loads generated by magnetic tape recordings. It is noted that many problems are encountered when interpreting the measured load histories and attempting to correlate them to constant cycle tests and to design conditions.

AB - Repeated application of stress resulting from locomotives and cars crossing a bridge may cause certain members of the bridge to become a fatigue subject. However, recorded stresses in railroad bridges conducted since 1940 by the Association of American Railroads have shown that only a small percentage of the actual stresses are near the maximum. Also, there are certain factors which tend to favor the bridge in terms of fatigue whereby the actual stresses are less than calculated. Whether or not a stress cycle is completed depends upon the relationship between the axle spacing and the span length. Continuing careful and close inspection is necessary at those locations where fatigue cracks might develop.

AB - A number of the cumulative-damage theories which are currently available have been reviewed. Significant assumptions regarding the manner in which fatigue damage is assumed to occur at different stress levels when these stress levels occur alone and when they are mixed are also delineated. On this basis the several theories are identified as stress-dependent or stress-independent and are classified further as interaction or interaction-free theories. All of the theories conform in their general aspects to observed phenomena.

AB - During the last 35 yr (1930's) extensive laboratory fatigue data have been accumulated for numerous types of structural members, connections and materials. These data have provided the basis on which fatigue design provisions have been developed for the principal design specifications for bridges. In the development of these provisions: (1) The expected life of the structure (number of cycles of loading); (2) the stress ratio (ratio of minimum stress to maximum stress); (3) the type of members, details and fabrication; and (4) the type of material in the structure have been taken into account. Although these fatigue provisions provide for improved designs, much still remains to be done to better relate bridge designs to loading conditions in the structures and to the behavior of the structures under such loading conditions.

AB - Fatigue considerations have been included in specifications for the design of steel structures for many years, usually in the form of decreased design stresses in the case of stress reversal. However, with the wider use of welding and high strength steels, fatigue has become more critical and fatigue provisions have become more comprehensive. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the application of current fatigue provisions to structural design. The three most common specifications relating to steel design, AASHO, AISC, and AREA are analyzed. Particular emphasis is placed on 1965 AASHO criteria as amended by the 1966-1967 ballot in relation to the design of both simple and continuous girder bridges. AASHO provisions follow the same basic relationships as the older fatigue criteria of AWS. However, AASHO provisions are more comprehensive, accounting for the strength of steel, type of stress, magnitude of stress ratio, and type of road and loading. Included are all allowable AASHO fatigue stresses for yield strengths from 36 ksi to 50 ksi, a flow chart for AASHO fatigue provisions, and two design examples using AASHO fatigue provisions.

AB - The proposed method is based upon an assumption that any kind of modification may be reduced to an addition of a certain number of new elements to the structure to be modified. The matrix operations algorithm adopting the force method is derived and yields the effect of an arbitrary modification on the stress-strain state of the modified structure. The algorithm eliminates the necessity of repetition of the solution of compatibility equations for the original structure if already solved. The obtained results are especially simple in application if the whole computation procedure is planned from the very beginning in a way so as to include the possibility of later modifications. The method is briefly compared with the initial strain approach and its applicability for calculating the effect of structural element nonlinearity is pointed out.

AB - A general procedure for the optimum design of framed structures of a prescribed geometrical configuration is presented. Statically determinate and indeterminate structures subjected to multiple loading conditions can be designed to satisfy limitations on both stresses and displacements at all points in the system. Linear behavior constraints on stresses and displacements are developed by effecting local changes in the design parameters and determining the resulting stress and displacement redistributions. Solution of the resulting linear programming problem is carried out iteratively on a digital computer by solving the corresponding dual programming problem. Appropriate stress and displacement constraints for truss, continuous beam, and rigid frame structures are derived and presented.

In a worked example, the variability in strength of an axially loaded short reinforced concrete column is investigated using the Monte Carlo technique and the results are compared with a closed form solution. Short cut methods of selective sampling are also described and demonstrated.

AB - A general formulation of a deflection theory is presented which is based on a continuous mathematical model. The problem is treated as a nonlinear boundary-value problem for ordinary differential equations. Because of its nonlinear character, the Newton-Raphson procedure is applied in a function space. Each linear solution within the Newton-Raphson solution is a linear boundary-value problem which is solved as sets of linear initial-value problems. Serious numerical difficulties are encountered in solving these initial-value problems, as well as the methods employed in overcoming these difficulties. The method presented differs substantially from the classical continuous deflection theory in that horizontal cable displacements are admitted, which eliminates the need for any explicit cable condition of compatibility. In addition, nonlinear terms in the cable equations of equilibrium are fully taken into account. Example problems are presented and the results are compared with the results of a discrete formulation by the writers. Conclusions are drawn concerning the effect of hanger elongations.

AB - Prestressed, precast hollow concrete box girder units are now being used extensively for underpasses, trestle renewal and stream bridges by major Western U.S. railroads. Historical development and current details of design, fabrication and methods of erection are presented, with special attention to 34 bridges totaling 2,350 linear feet on Southern Pacific's 78-mile Palmdale-Colton line in Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties, completed in 1067. Girders were fabricated in Arizona and transported by rail to site. Double-cell box girders form spans to 45 ft, and multiple single cell girders, weighing up to 70 tons each, for spans to 86 ft. Epoxy grout joins the boxes together longitudinally. The upper surface of the box serves as the floor for the railroad-ballasted track section. The boxes are supported on elastometric pads. Most economical bridges were 45-ft spans with open-end abutments. This type of construction expected to be economical for spans substantially in excess of 86 ft.

Both axial load P and torque T were applied simultaneously in a fixed P:T ratio till rupture. The torque-unit twist curves are almost linear till approximately 60% of the ultimate capacity which was attained either at the appearance of continuous diagonal cracks followed by concrete crushing in compression for specimens of low P:T ratio, or by concrete crushing in a spalling abrupt manner for high P:T ratios. The rupture criteria are analyzed, rupture surface defined, and equations to predict the ultimate capacity presented. These equations define a load-torque interaction diagram. An expression is also given to evaluate the unit twist at ultimate capacity.

AB - An approximate theory of buckling for multistory frames having shear bracing in the form of a vertical truss or shear panels is presented. The effects of the shear stiffness of the bracing and of the flexural stiffness of the girder are included in deriving the governing equations. Both the symmetrical mode and the unsymmetrical or sidesway mode of buckling are considered. Solutions to the systems of governing equations are given in closed form for the case in which the frame and the loading have certain regular characteristics. These solutions lead to formulas for the required girder stiffness when the bracing stiffness, column sizes and axial loads are prescribed. A method of solution for the general or irregular case is also described.

AB - A new method of minimum volume design of frames with continuously varying cross-sectional area is introduced. It relies exclusively on statical considerations and does not involve kinematical concepts like the only previously known method, developed by Heyman. Both methods are still highly idealized; they neglect the effect of the axial force and assume sandwich behavior of the cross section (namely that the required area is proportional to the bending moment, as is approximately the case in wide-flange thin-web I sections). The statical method permits an easier recognition of the possible configurations of the minimal stresses, requiring only combinations of location of a number of points along the axis of the structure and not the evolvement of possible patterns of deformation. It leads to a greater number of linear equations than its predecessor and makes possible the detection of the case of optimal determinancy, defined for the first time in this paper, in which the minimal stress is obtained more easily than in the general case.

AB - Columns in a multi-story building framework are usually designed to resist bending moments acting in the plane of the frame. An actual column, however, is frequently subjected to bending moments acting in two perpendicular directions in addition to an axial load. Except in Great Britain, no such considerations are now included in column design. It is the purpose of this paper to survey the present stand of the problem of columns under biaxial loading. The survey deals with two equally important aspects of progress—New solutions emerging from the analytical study and experimental results reported from laboratory tests, with emphasis placed on the fundamental concepts advanced by various investigators. Three typical solutions ranging from an almost exact to a rather crude approximation have been selected for a rather detailed discussion. Comparison of the analytical work with test results is reviewed. Directions of further study are indicated.
