AB - A method is developed of incorporating the effects of change of geometry in the analysis of rigidly jointed plane frames when using the displacement method. Where members are split into a moderate number of submembers the effects of change of geometry can be sufficiently represented by means of a nonlinear displacement transformation alone. Accurate results can be obtained with few submembers if the approximate nonlinear behavior of the submembers are taken into account. The method remains valid for cases of extreme deformation as long as the exact mathematical form of the displacement transformation is used.

AB - A general computer method for determining the distribution of lateral loads in asymmetric multistory structures is presented. The proposed solution is based on the stiffness method. The number of unknowns equals three times the number of stories and is independent of the number of stiffening elements (frames, shear walls, etc.). The structure may be subjected to eccentric vertical and lateral loadings and may include any kind and layout of stiffening elements. The method comprises the following three stages of analysis: determination of lateral stiffness matrix for each element; formulation and solution of equilibrium equations; and determination of the resultant forces by simple superposition. Elastic restraints of foundation, rotational constraints of the stiffening elements in their planes at the floor diaphragms, as well as axial deformations in elements may be considered by including their influences in evaluation of the lateral stiffness matrix of the respective element. Results obtained for an example building are evaluated.

AB - Structural end joints are required for the production of glued laminated timbers used in engineered construction. Prior to 1962, the laminating industry used plain scarf joints meeting a strength ratio performance criterion. In 1962 the end joint qualification criterion was changed to a specific performance criterion and adopted by Commercial Standards CS 253-63. Finger joints meeting this new criterion were first commercialized in 1962 and the industry is converting to this more economical process. Research and development were required to optimize the finger joint and production equipment leading to commercialization. In addition to being more economical, the finger joint is less variable than plain scarfed joints and therefore is preferred for structural as well as nonstructural uses.

AB - The effect of galvanizing on the ASTM A325 and A490 high-strength bolts and the performance of bolted joints under static loads in which the faying surfaces were galvanized, cold zinc painted, metallized, treated with vinyl wash or with another rust-preventing paint, were studied. Comparisons were made with nongahranized bolts and with joints with untreated mill-scale surfaces. The torque necessary to tighten the high-strength bolts is increased by galvanization, but this effect may be almost eliminated by the use of power torquing, or by lubrication. The hot dip galvanizing gave an average coefficient of friction of 0.23; the other surface treatments gave values between that of dry mill-scale and that of sandblasted metal surfaces.

AB - The stability of elastic-linear strain-hardening tubular cantilever columns is analyzed by numerical integration of the nonlinear differential equation with the aid of parametric equations expressing the moment-thrust-curvature relationships. Equilibrium curves for cantilever columns subjected to arbitrary end loads are first constructed. The envelopes of these equilibrium curves are shown to be the interaction curves. Approximate equations for the latter are derived and used to analyze simply supported columns subjected to arbitrary end loads. Column curves are presented for aluminum columns of Alloy 6061-T6. The results obtained from this analysis are discussed in the light of the corresponding allowable loads given by suggested specifications for such structures.

AB - The behavior of beams restrained at the ends against longitudinal displacements has been studied analytically to provide basic knowledge of the parameters that influence the behavior of such beams and to provide insight into the behavior of a similarly restrained slab. A method of analysis was developed which provided a reliable solution to the behavior of the restrained beam. The information obtained from the computer solution on the geometry of deformation and the strains, stresses and forces for the restrained beam permitted a careful analysis of the influence of various parameters on behavior. The effects of stiffness and eccentricity of the end restraints, steel reinforcement and midspan camber were investigated in detail for a wide range in slenderness of the beam. The results of this analysis were used to develop a simple approximate method to determine the load carrying capacity of the restrained beam.

AB - A method for the analysis of the steady state vibration of damped Timoshenko beams is presented. The usual four differential equations of the Timoshenko Theory are increased to eight differential equations with the addition of damping in the form of complex modulii. These equations are solved by numerical integration and, therefore, no restrictions need be placed on the longitudinal variation of the beam cross-section or the forcing function. The solution gives the beam response at all values of the forcing frequency and polar-plots are used for the determination of the resonant frequencies. To illustrate the wide applicability of the method the behavior of three beams, typical of those encountered in practice, is studied. The results of these examples show the importance of considering shear deformation when determining resonant frequencies and the great effect that the damping coefficient has on the magnitude of the response at resonance.

AB - A method of analysis of the dynamic response of a simple-span horizontally curved bridge subjected to a constant moving force is presented. Differential equations for the out-of-plane vibrational motion of the curved bridge under the action of the constant moving force are derived and solved with the method of initial conditions. The effect of the torsional inertia is studied both in the free vibration solution and in the forced vibration solution. The parameters of the problem are radius of horizontal curvature, rigidity ratio, and speed parameter. The effects of warping and damping are also studied. The significant parameters that describe the behavior of the horizontally curved bridge are the radius of curvature and the rigidity ratio. The effect of changing either of these two parameters results in the change of the fundamental natural frequency of the curved bridge. Under the passage of the constant moving force, the curved bridge is vibrating basically at its fundamental natural frequency.

The design criteria are related to the AISC specification. Beam deflections and the effects of hole reinforcement are not included. Some tentative rules governing design for buckling problems, particularly severe for beams with holes and for beams with eccentric holes and adjacent holes, are also presented, although it is emphasized that additional research is needed in these areas.

AB - An analysis based on the work energy principle is presented for the elastic lateral stability of light continuous chord trusses supported laterally at equidistant points along both chords. Tests on steel joists, which are representative of light trusses, show good agreement with the analysis. An approximate method, similar to that used for rolled beams, is on the conservative side of test results and is adequate for continuous chords of open cross-section. The more exact analysis of this paper is recommended for continuous chords of closed cross-section of large torsional stiffness compared to the stiffness of the web members. Additional tests on steel joists show that removal of lateral support on the bottom chord reduces the Critical load by about 10%. An analytical study of several selected joists shows that the spacing of bridging during construction depends on the physical properties of the chords, and the spacing at acceptable stress levels is significantly different than that presently used.
