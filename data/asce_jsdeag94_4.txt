AB - A method is presented for analyzing multispan suspension bridges subjected to longitudinal loads that act in the direction of bridge axis. It was assumed that the loads acting directly on the suspended structure are sustained by the structure itself, and only the loads on the cable are considered. The interaction of consecutive spans and the cable movements at tower tops cannot be disregarded. To analyze each span of a multispan bridge as an independent single-span with immovable cable ends renders erroneous results. Loads in center-lying spans are transferred to end spans. In a long, multispan bridge, longitudinal loading causes cable tension and stiffening-truss bending moments that cannot be disregarded when compared with what will arise from live loads as shown in the example of a 5,000-m, five-span bridge. An example of a three-span bridge is also presented.

AB - The instability of long prestressed concrete columns is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Tests on 36 slender eccentrically loaded hinged, axially prestressed concrete columns are described and conducted to determine the behavior of the columns in the full range of loading, including post-buckling. The variables investigated are eccentricity, slenderness, and prestress, each at three levels. A computer-oriented theory of nonlinear instability is presented, based on the cotangency criteria and using a finite element approach. Good agreement is shown between experimental and theoretical loads and deformations, both before and in the post-buckling region. The effects of slenderness, eccentricity and prestress are discussed. Future research needs are indicated.

AB - The possibility of predicting the load distribution on the culvert if the fill material, base material and method of fill are specified, is discussed. The additional feature of the deformation of the culvert as the fill material is placed is considered. Equilibrium culvert modes are dealt with and no concern has been given to the likelihood of the culvert buckling. After a brief review of the existing state of the problem, the important analytical additions are developed and then employed in the solution of typical problems.

AB - A finite-element method of analysis is presented for skewed composite beam bridges with diaphragms. The structure is divided into plate and eccentric stiffener elements for which stiffness matrices are derived. These stiffness matrices for the component elements are assembled into a total stiffness matrix for the structure. Solution of the resulting equilibrium equations gives nodal deformations of the structure which can be used to obtain internal forces. The method is compared with several existing methods of analysis for this type of structure. A typical bridge structure is analyzed to illustrate its behavior and the effects of adding diaphragms or skewing the structure.

AB - An extension of the available theories for the analysis of rectangular two-way reinforced metal deck plates into the large deflection, elasto-plastic stress region is described. A procedure is outlined which considers the yielding of the material of the reinforcing ribs caused by the combination of membrane as well as bending stress. Limit load for the procedure is achieved when full plastification of a rib is reached. The procedure uses the method of finite differences to obtain numerical solutions of the governing differential equations and to evaluate stresses. A large capacity, high speed digital computer was used in three numerical studies to test the validity of the analytical method.

The feasibility of satisfying certain structural, sound transmission and heat transmission requirements with a single homogeneous material is investigated.

AB - BUILD is a pilot version of a computer system for research in computer-aided building design being implemented as a subsystem of the Integrated Civil Engineering System (ICES) which is being developed in the Civil Engineering Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It provides a problem-oriented language for a limited but integrated description of a building whose geometry is based on the rectangular parallelepiped. It permits the user to specify a configuration of spaces, to indicate the materials of which surfaces are composed, to generate a structural frame at the edges of the spaces, and to make selective takeoffs of areas, volumes, weights, and costs. Geometric and topological data for the structure are in a form suitable for subsequent analysis using the Structural Design Language (STRUDL). In its present rudimentary state of development, BUILD is not a practical design system but a tool for studying problems of modeling buildings in computers. The research is directed toward an integrated information base which explicitly records interactions among design data and is capable of incremental extension in scope and detail.

AB - It is generally recognized that actual loading and construction details of hyperbolic paraboloid structures are far from ideal, and therefore incompatible with the membrane state of stress, leading to bending and twisting of shells and edge members. The magnitude of deformations and internal forces in the edge members of square hyperbolic paraboloid structures supported on four corners is discussed. The governing equations of the bending theory of shallow hyperbolic paraboloids are used for the shell, the classical relations of technical beam and torsion theory are used for the edge members, and continuity between shell and edge members and external support conditions are accounted for by appropriate boundary conditions. The resulting equations are nondimensionalized in terms of suitable structural parameters, converted to finite difference form, and solved by means of a high-speed computer. Results are plotted in the form of dimensional design curves suitable for the design of such structures.

AB - Silo and bin design is still largely an art because there is no rational and certain method to determine the loads exerted by the stored solid on the structure. In an attempt to rectify this situation, the American Iron and Steel Institute contracted with the writers to develop better bin design criteria. The work appears to be meeting with success. A new mathematical theory has been postulated: two different loading conditions have been identified—initial, which occurs on filling, and flow, which occurs on emptying—and the important transient effect of the switch from initial to flow has been evaluated. That effect explains the wide scatter of results measured by so many investigators. To date, design criteria have been developed for symmetric mass-flow hoppers. An example of design is given. The design data are now being expanded to mass-flow bins, i.e., to mass-flow hoppers with a cylindrical surcharge. At a future date it is hoped to expand them further to funnel-flow bins.

AB - A simple and direct relationship that exists between an iterative method and the corresponding matrix inversion allows the inherent simplicity of the moment distribution method to be combined with the more powerful matrix methods. Generalized forces, as well as moments, are treated in an explicit and practical form without the need for computing displacements. Where joint translations are present, the final moments can be readily expressed as the original solution plus a linear combination of sideway solutions. A bent with sidesway and a grid with torques, moments and shears are given to illustrate the method.
