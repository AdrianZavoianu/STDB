AB - Analysis of pile foundations is accomplished by calculation of the stiffness influence coefficients. Piling loads and deflections can be determined, as well as the principal frequencies. Axial and torsional elastic constants for a pile may be adjusted to the physical problem; the torsional constant has negligible effect and may usually be neglected. The elastic constants dependent on bending may be derived in several ways including tests or physical models based on an assumed behavior of the system such as: a semi-infinite beam on an elastic foundation, a free cantilever fixed at an assumed depth, or as a free cantilever fixed to a semi-infinite beam on an elastic foundation. The stiffness influence coefficients may be formed from simple matrices defining elastic constants and position or from a list of equations.

AB - An analytical and experimental investigation is presented, and a simplified analytical method is derived that closely predicts experimental results. The analysis is applied to butt-type timber tension joints under loading in the elastic range. A program of tests was designed to study the distribution of load among the bolts and the effect of the joint properties on the distribution for comparison with theoretical results. Joints containing six or more bolts in a row are found to have a highly uneven distribution of bolt loads, and the two end bolts together usually carry over 50% of the load. The addition of more than six bolts in a row does not substantially increase the elastic strength of the joint. Small misalinement of bolt holes may cause large shifts in bolt loads. The most even distribution of bolt loads occurs in a butt joint in which the extensional stiffness of the main member is equal to that of both splice plates. Some slight redistribution of load from the more heavily loaded end bolts to the less heavily loaded interior bolts takes place when bolt bearing is the mode of failure.

AB - The behavior of several multistory, one-bay and two-bay planar frames is examined by means of computerized elastic-plastic analysis. Each frame is unbraced, fixed at its base, and loaded by static, proportional forces up to the maximum load carrying capacity. The results of first-order elastic-plastic analyses are used as a basis for classifying and explaining the behavior of second-order models. The magnitudes of second-order effects on both load carrying capacity and deformations are presented. The influence of axial deformation is included in the examination of frame behavior.

AB - A compatibility method of analysis is developed for the study of the inelastic in-plane behavior of multistory steel rigid frames subject to sidesway. The method provides for the following conditions to be satisfied throughout the frame simultaneously: (1) The internal forces are in equilibrium with the external forces on the deflected frame; (2) the curvature of each portion of each member satisfies the appropriate nonlinear moment-thrust-curvature relationship; and (3) the distortions of all the parts satisfy the condition of continuity of the frame. The analysis is obtained by successive approximations. A special technique is developed to facilitate the analysis at the condition of ultimate load, and in the early stages of instability of the frame. Good agreement is obtained with tests conducted by others on three full-scale frames.

AB - A three-dimensional stiffness coefficient matrix for constant cross section curved beams is derived. This matrix relates the beam end point rotations and translations to the internal moments, torques, shears, and axial forces. The stiffness matrix is transformed into a three-dimensional spatial coordinate system by means of a coordinate transformation matrix. The transformation matrix is derived by rotating the orthogonal coordinate axis through three consecutive rotations. Finally an example problem, simulating a spherical dome is worked to demonstrate the application of the curved beam stiffness matrix coefficients.

AB - Probabilistic procedures for forecasting occurrence and intensities of earthquakes are presented based on the historical record of Modified Mercalli intensities. The occurrence is assumed Poisson for each intensity level. Forecasting is accomplished using Bayesian procedures. Forcasts for the San Francisco region are made for a 10-yr period. The optimization of design decisions is made using a statistical decision theory model. Three alternate designs are compared for a structure on the basis of expected losses for a ten-yr period. The technique of estimating expected losses given an earthquake of each intensity level is illustrated. Time to occurrence problems are also discussed. More complex models using a multinomial model for intensity and Poisson occurrence are introduced including the problem of multiple occurrence, Bayesian forecasting relationships are derived.

AB - The problem of the geometric and surface factors affecting the interface damping in a lap joint is considered, and leads to suggestions on dimensional arrangements and surface treatments necessary to maximize this energy dissipation. It is shown that the width of the joint should be a minimum, and that any surface treatment of the interface should make it smoother and reduce the shear strength and local modulus. Gross slip should only be allowed to occur at occasional critical loadings.

AB - Conventional optimum structural design methods assume that a continuous spectrum of member sizes is available to the designer. For example, in the minimum weight rigid-plastic design of stiff-jointed frameworks, it is usually assumed that the weight per unit length of frame members is a linear function of their fully plastic moment. In actual fact, the sections available consist of a finite range of discrete member sizes. By making use of discrete programming techniques, it is possible to derive design methods which do not depend on theoretical weight-strength functions, but instead work directly with the available discrete sections. Two classes of design problem are considered: (1) The design of stiff jointed frameworks using rigid-plastic theory; and (2) the elastic design of statically determinate triangulated frameworks subject to deflection constraints.
