AB - Vertical loading tests were conducted on several hyperbolic paraboloid (hypar) roofs fabricated from single layers of corrugated steel sheets: (1) A 4-ft-sq shell with rectangular corrugations; (2) two 8-ft-sq shells with standard curved corrugations; (3) three adjustable-warp 18-in.-sq corrugated-steel-foil models; and (4) two full-size canopies, one 20-ft by 24-ft and the other 20-ft by 28-ft in plan, each canopy consisting of a single column supporting four hyperbolic paraboloid quadrants fabricated from standard curved corrugated steel sheets. The tests demonstrated that hyperbolic paraboloids fabricated from a single layer of standard curved corrugated steel sheets are structurally feasible, provided that adequate attention is given to certain design features. The superior local buckling resistance of curved corrugations appears to make them superior to sheets with rectangular corrugations for this application.

AB - The gust response factor is a measure of the effective wind loading on a structure and is intended to translate the dynamic response phenomena due to gust loading into relatively simpler static design criteria. The calculation involves a power spectrum analysis of dynamic structural response of a linear, single-degree-of-freedom system with viscous damping and utilizes reported measurements of wind gust spectra and gust correlation coefficients. Calculated results of this method are presented in the form of charts which permit the direct determination of gust response factors. A rational method of transferring long-term Weather Bureau wind records to rough and obstructed exposures is presented. The effect of gusts on the design and serviceability of buildings is discussed. For large structures, the results of this paper suggest that the use of fastest mile pressures could overestimate the true wind loading on such structures.

AB - An experimental and analytical investigation of the behavior and ultimate strength of wide-flange beams having unreinforced rectangular web holes is summarized. Rectangular holes were chosen because of their prevalence in practice. Four 10-ft long 16WF36 simply supported beams were tested with one or two concentrated loads. Results showed that as the load on the beam with a web hole increases, the first yielding in the beam in the vicinity of the hole occurs at the corners of the hole as a result of stress concentration at the corner. With further increase of the load, yielding spreads through the web and through the flanges. The ultimate load can be predicted by a lower-bound solution in which strain hardening is neglected. The ultimate loads for the test beams averaged 19% below the experimental loads. The allowable design loads indicate that the plastic-design analysis gives the greater allowable load, except at very high moment-shear ratios.

AB - Current developments in the fabrication and testing of structural models are summarized. Considerable emphasis is placed on the emergence of a technology for the manufacture of small scale ultimate load models and the consequent increase in usage of such models. Comparisons are given of the relative cost effects of various decisions in the modeling process and methods for reducing costs are outlined. Examples of successful and unsuccessful studies are presented to illustrate the necessity for detailed planning and inspection of all fabrication, loading, and instrumentation systems. Three-dimensional structural models, and a complete spectrum of load ranges, from static to blast loading are included. While primary attention is given to ultimate load models, requirements for service load testing and buckling studies are also included.

AB - Advantages and disadvantages of commonly used model materials are discussed. Plastics are used for indirect models or direct models in the elastic range. They follow Hooke’s Law for the range of strains usually used and have low moduli of elasticity, so measurable strains and deflections can be obtained with small loads. They can be easily formed, machined, and assembled, but their mechanical properties are sensitive to environment and methods of test. For modeling reinforced concrete structures up to ultimate load, cementitious materials with similar stress-strain curves up to failure as the prototype must be used. The properties of frequently used cementitious materials, particularly micro-concrete, are discussed. Model reinforcement is limited to steel or phosphor bronze because of the need of fairly well pronounced yield points. Threaded rod can be used to assure sufficient bond for gypsum mortar. Metallic models can be made of steel, aluminum and copper alloys. Miscellaneous materials such as cement asbestos, cardboard and wood are discussed.

AB - The determination of the yield-point load of a curved beam is formulated as a linear programming problem by means of the lower bound theorem of limit analysis. By using the replacement structure corollary for an upper bound in conjunction with this lower bound formulation, an efficient iterative technique is developed. The method has been coded in a FORTRAN IV program which is capable of handling any inplane arch supported in any manner at two ends. Some possible applications of this program to design are described. Finally, some results are given which illustrate the strength advantages of curved beams compared to straight beams.

AB - The available theoretical and experimental information on composite and noncomposite hybrid steel beams and girders, is used by Subcommittee 1 on Hybrid Beams and Girders of the Joint ASCE-AASHO Committee on Flexural Members as a basis for design suggestions for such members. The Subcommittee concluded that composite and noncomposite hybrid steel beams can be efficiently designed on the basis of the initial flange-yield moment. Specifically, an allowable flange stress that is slightly below the allowable stress normally used for the flange steel can be applied and the bending stress in the web need not be checked. The shear stress in the web, however, must be limited to the normal allowable stress for the web steel. The allowable width-to-thickness ratios and stiffener requirements are generally the same as those given in the AISC and AASHO specifications for homogeneous beams. Available data indicate that hybrid beams can generally be designed for fatigue as if they were fabricated homogeneous beams of the flange steel.

The approach is limited to truss-type structures having one or more members stressed above their proportional limit. The analysis results in stresses and corresponding strains in all members as well as in node deflections of the structure. Examples are solved and results are compared with previous experimental investigations.

AB - An experimental study was conducted on two aluminum nonprismatic folded plate structural models. The stresses, moments, and deflections predicted by a theory for the analysis of long nonprismatic folded plate structures, which is an extension of ordinary folded plate theory, are compared to the experimental results obtained from the model study. Model 1 is made of eight triangular plates with a span to maximum depth ratio of about three. Model 2 is made of eight trapezoidal plates with a span to maximum depth ratio of about four. The predictions by the theory are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental results for both models. It is also shown that elementary beam theory is inaccurate in predicting the behavior of interior plate elements in regions where large differences exist between the depths of adjacent plates.

AB - A theory is presented for the analysis of long nonprismatic folded plates, which may consist of combinations of tapered and rectangular plate elements. This is a natural extension of ordinary folded plate theory and is based on a method of nodal analysis. Corrections are considered for the effects of relative joint displacements. Application of the theory is not limited to cases of similar loadings, and prismatic folded plates can be analyzed as special cases. A computer program developed for applying the theory is described. Examples illustrating applications of the theory are presented. Studies of varying the plate taper in a structure show that the effects of relative joint displacements are large in regions where the tapered plates are narrow. It is also shown that elementary beam theory may be very inaccurate in predicting the stresses in interior elements of nonprismatic folded plates.

AB - A simple but powerful method for the design of connections in precast concrete is introduced. The method is based on a physical model of behavior, rather than on curve-fitting to empirical data. It is thus suitable for a wide variety of connection problems, as well as for connection geometries not covered by previous tests. When properly used, this approach results in reliable, ductile connections which do not suffer from the various types of distress all too common in precast connections. The concrete is assumed to crack in an unfavorable location, in the region of the connection. The shear-friction hypothesis is then used to determine the amount of reinforcing which must cross the assumed cracks. Shearing stresses along an assumed crack are resisted by friction. The normal force required to mobilize friction is provided by reinforcing steel, placed normal to the assumed crack. Applications to composite beams, corbels, bearing shoes, tension splices, and confinement are discussed, and a practical design example is given.

AB - Analytical procedures are developed for computing the maximum carrying capacity of steel columns subjected to combined axial thrust and lateral load. It is assumed that the columns are permitted to deflect only in the plane of the applied load and that failure is always caused by excessive bending in the same plane. Numerical results are obtained for four types of columns with different loading and support conditions and are presented in the form of interaction curves relating axial thrust, lateral load, and slenderness ratio. The analytically obtained results are compared with the predictions based on an empirical interaction formula and good agreement is observed.

AB - A consistent formulation for the geometrically nonlinear behavior of linear elastic rigid framed structures is developed and the appropriate equations for two solution procedures, successive substitution and Newton-Raphson, are derived. A linearized incremental loading procedure and stability analysis are described. The formulation is applied to two structures and comparison studies illustrating the effect of load increment size and convergence tolerance on the total computational effort are included. The results indicate that the Newton-Raphson method is more efficient, particularly for low convergence tolerance. Also, if only a single solution is desired, it is more efficient to apply the total load in one step rather than in increments.

AB - Design techniques for determining inelastic deflections of beams made from gradual-yielding materials are investigated. New as well as existing methods are presented and evaluated. Factors such as accuracy, limitations in applicability, and amount of numerical work required to obtain solutions are considered. Two methods are shown to be especially well suited for routine engineering design. The small amount of numerical work involved in these methods stems from the fact that an explicit moment-curvature relationship exists. Deflections obtained by these methods are shown to be in excellent agreement with accurate solutions obtained by numerical integration procedures. The good agreement between exact and approximate solutions is shown to be valid for various cross-sectional shapes, loading conditions and stress-strain curves.

AB - An experimental investigation of strains, stresses, crack widths and end slips in axially reinforced concrete prisms subjected to repeated tension loads is presented. Cylindrical specimens were reinforced with deformed steel bars. To obtain the strain distribution along the length of the bars, these were sectioned longitudinally, grooved for installation of 30 strain gages along the length, and after wiring the gages, the sections were rewelded to form instrumented bars with effectively undisturbed exterior. The specimens were subjected to repeated loads at different stress levels. Residual effects after unloading and changes in strain distribution which results from prior loading history are analyzed. Results show that effectiveness of stress transfer between concrete and steel depends primarily on the magnitude of the previous maximum load. The greater the magnitude of this load, the lesser is the effectiveness of stress transfer at subsequent lower stress levels. Analytical evaluations of the effects of shrinkage and tension loading are also presented. The results of these evaluations give an insight into the phenomena of cracking and stress transfer between steel and concrete.
