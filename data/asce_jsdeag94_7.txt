AB - Some of the important advantages of probabilistic design procedures are presented and compared with deterministic techniques. The problem of the compounding of hazards is illustrated by comparing a series type of structure with a parallel type of structure. Both structures have the same characteristics from a deterministic viewpoint, but the parallel type clearly is superior to the series type if probabilistic concepts are employed. The specification of material properties in manufacture is clearly probabilistic. These same material properties are specified and treated deterministically in structural practice without regard to the actual properties of the materials. Similarly, real loadings, although probabilistic in nature are treated as deterministic. Analysis and design procedures employ models of loading and response that have little relationship to reality. The design decision process for seismic loading is illustrated using statistical decision theory. The formulation of optimization of decisions under uncertainty is considered.

AB - Preliminary results on the reinforcing of glue-laminated wood beams are presented and a new method of reinforcing such beams with mild steel strips is described. With this method the reinforcement can be effectively concealed and the beam will retain its natural appearance. The mild steel reinforcing has been successfully bonded to the wood by adhesives, and the reinforced beams have behaved as a true composite within the elastic range. Considerable decrease of deflections and increase of load carrying capacity have been obtained. The stiffness of the beams reinforced on the top and bottom surfaces, has been increased 100% and greater. Shear deflection varied between 14% and 19% of the total deflection and has been an important factor in deflection calculations.

AB - If ablative coatings are used to protect reentry vehicles under severe aerodynamic heating, why can they not be used to protect structural steel in fires? To answer this question, it is necessary to define ablation, to explore the nature of the thermal effectiveness of ablative materials, and to investigate the problems associated with the use of ablative materials for structural fire protection. A clear understanding of the differences between aerodynamic reentry atmospheres and the fire atmospheres is also important. All these factors are discussed. Several ablative systems presently used in aerospace applications along with specially formulated systems were evaluated in an idealized fire atmosphere. These high-performance aerospace ablative systems are not satisfactory for fire atmospheres from both a thermal and economic standpoint. However, other systems are presently available that yield sufficient char for thermal protection. The limitations of these systems is primarily in the cost of the raw materials and susceptibility of these systems to cracking.

AB - An analysis for a box girder cell with deformable cross section and flexible interior diaphragms is developed using an analogy to the theory of beams on elastic foundations. The analogy gives a clear view of the effects of box girder and diaphragm proportions on the longitudinal warping and transverse flexural stresses induced by deformation of the cross section. Conventional flexural and torsional analyses do not reveal these effects; complex, refined analyses do not give insight into box girder behavior. The analysis is applicable to straight box girders and accounts for longitudinally or transversely stiffened plate elements, nonprismatic sections, continuity over intermediate supports, and arbitrary end support conditions. The analogy provides a basis for a direct and rational approach to box girder design.

AB - A simple method for the analysis of multiple folded-plate systems is presented based on the ordinary folded-plate theory. The procedure may be applied to any single-span system having any number of plates meeting at a given joint. Use of loading, moment, and deflection reference curves together with node-point computations allow various end support conditions and types of loading to be analyzed without applying deflection coefficients. The validity and the accuracy of the results are evaluated on the basis of holding force error curves. The method is also useful for warping-torsion problems. A Fortran computer program based on the method has been developed for the IBM 360/50 digital computer. The paper summarizes this program and demonstrates the method with several example plate systems.

AB - Using methods previously reported, annual extreme wind speed data series were extended with recent records at airports and reduced to the standard 30-ft elevation. These were fitted by the Fisher-Tippett Type II (Fréchet) distribution by a logarithmic transformation of the Type I distribution. Maps are given for the 2 yr, 10 yr, 25 yr, 50 yr, and 100-yr mean recurrence intervals. A map for the 50-yr interval for Alaska is included as well as tabular data for Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Confidence limits on mean recurrence intervals are extended to the new record length and fixed interval probabilities are discussed. A nomogram for power law elevation-speed conversion for powers of 1/7, 1/5, and 1/3 is included.

AB - An investigation was conducted to determine the static and dynamic properties of a group of potential structural materials consisting of conventional concrete, a mixture of cement and a lightweight aggregate, prestressed concrete, a commercial epoxy, and combinations of epoxy and aggregate and epoxy and an aluminum powder. In addition to the static strength, Young's moduli and Poisson ratios, the dynamic values for the last two quantities were ascertained from pulse measurements in ballistically-suspended Hopkinson bars of specimens subjected to the central longitudinal impact of a 1/2-in. diam steel sphere at various initial velocities. Consistent and repeatable results were obtained from surface strain gage records. The results obtained were compared to those of previous investigations involving igneous rocks.
