AB - Prestressed steel enables the designer to achieve a greater elastic range than is possible for an identical non-prestressed member. This makes a prestressed steel member advantageous to resist relatively large overloads without suffering permanent distortion. Prestressing is a means of efficiently utilizing various strength steels in built-up beams or girders, so that significant savings in weight and depth of members can be achieved. This is accomplished without reduction in the factor of safety against yielding for any of the steels, but does reduce the margin of safety against plastic mechanism.

AB - The effect of oversize and slotted holes is evaluated on the slip resistance and ultimate strength of bolted joints. Tests were performed with 21 samples with various types of joints. Oversize or slotted holes do not affect losses in bolt tension with time. Slip behavior of these joints is similar to slip behavior of joints with holes of nominal size. The average slip coefficient for joints with 1/4 in. hole clearance was about the same as the slip coefficient for hole joints. Changes in bolt tension were not greatly affected by oversize holes or slots. Slotted holes placed perpendicular to the line of load in the enclosed plates of a bolted joint did not reduce the tensile strength of the plates or the shear strength of the bolts.

AB - The principle of virtual work is employed to derive general relations governing geometrically nonlinear structural behavior. From these basic relations, three general finite-element analysis models, namely, potential energy, direct and incremental, are formulated for nonlinear pre- and post-buckling analyses. In addition, a quadratic eigenvalue model is developed for the prediction of critical load levels. The analysis models are expressed in matrix notation within the framework of the finite-element technology and an inter-consistency is observed among the component matrices. These matrices are given geometrical interpretation and a hierarchy of nonlinearity is developed. Specific representative finite elements are considered and alternative computational procedures are associated with the several levels in the hierarchy of nonlinearity. Recommendations are made concerning the conduct of geometrically nonlinear finite-element analysis.

AB - Existing AISC specifications account for column buckling within a rigid frame configuration by recommending certain K values which modify the actual unbraced column length to an effective length. These values are derived from idealized theoretical considerations assuming all columns in the frame to be of identical stiffnees and with identical loading. Where either columns with unequal stiffness are subject to equal loads or columns with identical stiffness are subject to unequal loads presently the design will be based on the most unfavorable combination. In the first case the column with the least stiffness will be designed without utilizing the reserve strength of the stiffer column. In the second case the heavier loaded columns is designed without regard to the inherent reserve strength furnished by the column with the smaller axial load. To utilize the hitherto unused reserve strength of columns in such one story steel frames, a general design method based on the slope deflection theory is presented. Tables are included facilitating rapid column design.

AB - A method of analysis of the dynamic response of a horizontally curved simple-span bridge is presented subjected to a smoothly moving mass load. The methods of analysis for vibration of bridges on straight alignment involving moving mass loads are reviewed. Solution of the present problem through the use of the method of undetermined coefficients is demonstrated. A parametric study is made of the effects of horizontal curvature, rigidity ratio, speed parameter, weight ratio and frequency ratio on the response of the bridge to flexural and torsional vibrations. The effects of the first three parameters on the response with the moving mass load are nearly the same as those with a constant moving force, while those of the latter two parameters are essentially the same as that of a straight bridge.
