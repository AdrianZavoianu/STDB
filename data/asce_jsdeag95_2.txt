AB - Two different models of nonlinear beams which can be used to represent the girders and columns of a nonlinear multistory structure are described and compared. One beam model is limited to bilinear bending moment-end rotation hysteretic characteristics. The other model can have different curvilinear and bilinear hysteretic characteristics at each end. Three different definitions of ductility factor are made and applied to yielding beams. These types of beam models can be used in studies of the dynamic response of earthquake excited multi-degree of freedom yielding structures.

AB - A method of analysis is presented along with charts and tables for simplified computations of elasto-plastic deflections of beams of tubular cross sections at different stages of yield conditions. The analysis for variable segments under arbitrary loadings and various boundary conditions is described. This generalization is achieved by normalizing the moment-curvature and load-displacement relationships and other parametric variables. Examples are presented to demonstrate the usefulness and simplicity of the method. The tables and charts are developed specifically for application in the straightening process of crooked members in cannon manufacturing. The structural behavior of the straightening process on the initially bent, heavy high strength beams, of tubular sections, is thus critically examined in the proposed elasto-plastic analysis. The limit of initial crookedness is estimated for any chosen failure criterion. The load-displacement curves for single and double point load are compared.

AB - Deflections of regular trusses formed from repeated modules (panels) are analyzed using finite-difference calculus. The expressions used are in general algebraic form allowing for arbitrary stiffnesses of the bars forming the basic panel and arbitrary panel width and panel depth. Solutions for simply supported and cantilever trusses under the action of point loads, uniform loads and linearly varying loads are given in terms of polynomials. It is shown that by using Taylor's expansion the finite-difference equations reduce approximately to the differential equation for the bending and shear of an analogous beam. The degree of accuracy is related directly to the fineness of the trusses. Analogous beam solutions are compared with the given solutions showing that the analogy is satisfactory.

AB - The minimum weight design of hyperbolic cooling towers is examined. Taking the duty-performance coefficient as the primary behavior constraint, the design is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, and the critical dimensions of the lightest towers for various values of the duty-performance coefficient are tabulated considering a wide range of shell parameters. In general, the towers with sharper curvature appeared to be lighter when compared to other towers with the same duty-performance coefficient.

AB - A computer program based on a finite difference method of analysts has been developed for determining load deformation relationships to failure for pin-ended eccentrically loaded steel columns encased in concrete. The solutions obtained are the most accurate yet determined and take into account both the linear and nonlinear ranges of the two materials; comparisons have been made with the results of tests on both small and full scale columns. Quantitative Information obtained from the computer program has been used to examine critically existing and other likely design criteria applicable to columns of both British Standard and Universal sections. It is demonstrated that the simple interaction formula used in some design codes to determine permissible combinations of axial force and bending moment, leads to variations in load factor which are irrational. Consideration is also given to the control of the incidence of cracking of concrete under working conditions.

AB - The construction and testing of a small-scale mortar model of a prestressed concrete reactor vessel is described at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to determine to what extent small-mortar models and models of elastic materials, such as epoxy, can be used to investigate the stress distributions and the cracking and ultimate failure modes of prestressed concrete reactor vessels. Mortar model design and fabrication techniques are discussed. Test results for the various steps of the prestressing sequence, for a short creep test period, and for a pneumatic pressure test to failure are presented. Vessel failure was gradual; after extensive concrete cracking, the vessel liner failed with an immediate loss of pressure. The elastic and short-term creep behavior are compared to finite-element analysis predictions. Preliminary comparisons are also made with the test results for a second identical mortar model, tested hydraulically, and with the results for a small concrete prototype vessel.

AB - Resulting experimental data, from testing two bridge structures, is compared to results from finite difference plate theory. Two bridge structures tested are: (1) 200-ft span through truss; and (2) 80-ft span composite slab-steel girder bridge. Strain data were obtained during the truss bridge tests, and both strains and deflections were obtained during the steel girder bridge tests. Results from the comparison of experimental and analytical data give excellent agreement. The analytical technique is computer oriented, requiring minor calculations in order to obtain the resulting data.
