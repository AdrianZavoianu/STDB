AB - Stress distributions in sphere-cylinder transition regions of externally pressurized thick-walled vessels are studied. Data determined by two different approaches, photoelasticity and finite element computer programs, are compared. These approaches afford a capability for analyzing complicated deep ocean structures that are of considerable interest to the U.S. Navy. Two small-scale epoxy models of the prototype structures were loaded by external pressure and stress frozen. The first model had a cylinder radius-to-wall thickness ratio = 8 and incorporated 60% balanced opening reinforcement at the transition. The second had a cylinder radius-to-wall thickness ratio of 2.5 and 65% balanced reinforcement. After stress freezing, tie models were sliced longitudinally and transversely; meridional and circumferential stresses were determined photoelastically in a diffused-light polariscope. The experimental solutions verified stresses calculated by finite element computer programs.

AB - Inelastic design of steel structures to withstand seismic forces requires a knowledge of the behavior of connections when subjected to cyclically reversed loading. This paper contains a description of the design and quasi-static testing of selected steel beam-to-column connection specimens. The motivations for the choice of connection types and over-all geometry of the specimens are described, relating them to full-size prototypes used in actual building frames. The characteristics of the test installation are described, including means of loading, type of lateral support provided, etc. The programs of cycling of most of the tests are presented in terms of the deflection of the tip of the cantilever beam. Typical hysteresis diagrams and failure photographs are also included. The outstanding features of the behavior of several specimens during testing are described and compared, and possible explanations given for particular aspects. It is shown that steel connections are remarkably resistant to failure due to cyclically induced damage. The results of all of the tests are summarized, and an attempt made to draw comparisons and conclusions of some-what broader applicability.

AB - Results of a test on a composite steel and concrete beam incorporating a cellular steel deck are reported. Good agreement between measured and computed values of strain and deflection is indicated prior to first yielding. The beam behaved in accordance with the elastic theory for composite beams with incomplete interaction. The load-slip characteristic for the end connections was determined from the beam test results. The maximum strength of a connection computed from the measured load and end slips in the elastic range has been used to estimate the ultimate strength of the beam. Elastic theory prediction of major breakdown of interaction under the load-points of a beam with symmetrical two point load system was confirmed in the test when the extreme fiber strains in the steel and concrete at the load points exceeded those at mid-span in the elastic range. At maximum load two discrete hinges formed at the load points. It is shown how efficiency factors for flexural stress and deflection can be derived.

AB - Proposed low-cost temporary or emergency bulk grain storage structures are presented and their design criteria and construction features discussed. The world's food shortage caused by rapid population increase, requires maximum growth of cereal grain and adequate storage facilities to prevent threatening famine in food deficient countries. Millions of bushels are wasted through spoilage caused by defective storage or lack of it during peak harvest periods. Criteria for safe storage of grain and their effect on the design of storage structures are outlined. Typical designs of fixed-type and movable type grain retaining walls of timber and concrete block construction are shown. Storage under tarpaulin tents and air-supported structures are described. Structures are chosen for their simplicity and suitability to low-cost labor areas commonly found in countries with developing modem economies. They can also be used in this country, on large farms for the storage of some of their grains during harvest period, awaiting price increase later in the season.

AB - Most previously derived plane stress finite elements cannot be connected with line elements in bending. This difficulty is overcome by devising a new element which has rotational degrees of freedom at the node points. Application to analysis of simple shear wall problems with a single row of openings illustrates the method and comparison of results with other solutions demonstrates its validity. A study of the behavior of the new element in comparison with results for a more conventional element shows: (1) For the same number of elements, the accuracy of estimation of deflection is increased and (2) the ratio of length to breadth of the elements has a less significant effect on the results.

AB - Exact deformation solutions are found for rationally based discrete-continuous models of rectangular ribbed plates having simple end supports and flexible side supports. The formulas are valid for general loadings and are improvements over those based on orthotropic plate theory in that the inconsistencies inherent in the use of an equivalent continuum are avoided. The solutions are double Fourier series (infinite with respect to the continuous variable along the rib line and finite with respect to the discrete variable denoting the rib) plus simple corrective terms where required to satisfy special boundary conditions. Fourth order mathematical models are used for a Composite Membrane Analysis and a Non-Composite Flexural Analysis and a general eighth order model is used for Composite Membrane-Flexural Analysis. The major results are numerically illustrated.

AB - A finite-difference method is developed to determine the transverse deflections of a vibrating plate. Explicit and implicit difference formulas are considered. The implicit formulation, which has been programmed for a digital computer, is derived to permit variations in bending stiffness, support stiffness, mass density, and loading. Numerical results demonstrate that the method is applicable to a wide range of problems involving both transient and steady-state response of plates.

AB - The influences of edge constraint upon the behaviour of single panel ruled surface hyperbolic paraboloids with straight generator boundaries are studied. With apex and base corners clamped in position and against rotation, each of the degenerate clamped, simple and free edge conditions are considered and shown to represent the extreme behaviour of various physical-numerical analogues of the shelledge beam interaction. The significance on over-all shell behaviour of a number of second order shell edge beam Interaction terms are then assessed. Finally consideration is given to an estimation of the significance of stress resultants in the over-all load carrying capacity of the shell.
