AB - The field observation of the Tagus River suspension Bridge was started by the LNEC Division of Observation of Structures in 1961, and has been its main activity thereafter. The aim of the observation is to determine the actual behavior of the structure under the action of different types of loadings in order to estimate the overall safety conditions in it. In addition to preparing the overall plan and part plans of observation of the suspension bridge and of different approach viaducts, the majority of the equipment required had first to be designed and manufactured. The instruments, some of them original, were constructed at the LNEC Division of Observation of Structures and of Instrument Design and Construction. The field observation of the structure can be divided into three stages: measurements during construction, load test (July 1966) and long-term observation up to 1971. The techniques followed and the results obtained in the suspension bridge and the approach viaducts are presented.

AB - The theoretical and experimental investigation of axially loaded architectural sandwich columns having plastic foam cores was concentrated on establishing analysis formulas for localized modes of instability. The objective was accomplished through the development of face wrinkling theories, which, for the first time, allow the unified analysis of face wrinkling with initial waviness for anti-symmetrical mode shapes. The procedure is based on an improvement in the beam-on-elastic foundation theory coupled with a semi-empirical correlation factor for initial waviness. The significance of this method is that face wrinkling mode of buckling may be determined without need for experimental testing of a similar sandwich to that being designed. Experimental studies revealed face wrinkling as the controlling local failure mechanism. A theoretically sound and statistically supported design guide was presented to provide the structural designer with a rational and manageable method for predicting face wrinkling failure stresses in foam-plastic core architectural sandwich panels.

AB - An analysis of circular cylindrical shells prestressed within the curved surface and supported on diaphragms at the shell ends is presented. The prestressing loads from the anchorages, cable curvature and friction are arranged as symmetrical or antisymmetrical actions along a number of shell generators. Satisfactory convergence of a Levy type solution to the Donald-Karman-Jenkins cylindrical shell equation is found. The theoretical solutions are compared with experimental results obtained from a small scale aluminum model of intermediate length. Deflections and strains at a number of places were measured when the model was prestressed with a variety of draped and straight cables. The test results, which were repeatable and reliable, were generally within a few per cent of the theoretical values. Transverse stresses, found to be of the same order as the longitudinal stresses, frequently changed sign across the shell and altered considerably with changes of cable position.

AB - When prismatic members are sliced longitudinally for the purpose of measuring residual stresses, a curvature often develops in the strip. This curvature is caused by a gradient of residual stresses through the wall thickness, so that surface strain measurements alone can grossly misrepresent the true average strain. An additional measurement of the offset of the sliced strip from its initially straight position provides a second independent distortion quantity and enables a separation of average and gradient components of residual strain. The test includes the equations required for data reduction, an analysis of the error involved in neglecting varying amounts of curvatures and the precision required in measurements. The technique was applied to rectangular structural tubing with satisfactory results.

AB - For the aseismic design of structures, the dynamic forces are generally replaced by equivalent static forces which are usually given as a function of the effective weight of the structure. The effective weight of a structure consists of full dead weight and a fraction of live loads as these are invariably spring and dashpot mounted. This paper presents the effect of such a mounting on the response of structures subjected to horizontal ground motion caused by an earthquake. The primary system as well as live load system have been idealized as single degree of freedom systems. This study indicates that only a part of the live load is effective under horizontal vibrations and this depends on the ratio of live to dead load and the amount of damping present in the live load model. The effect of various other parameters, namely, the spring mounting, undamped natural period of vibration of the primary system and the ground motion has also been investigated.

AB - Solution of a set of simultaneous equations is the central problem in static structural analysis. An integrated approach to equation solution is explained, the basis of which is the use of wavefront data processing and a modified Gauss solution algorithm. The wavefront processing involves the allocation of data in accordance with the structural connectivity rather than the bandwidth. Hence, larger sparse matrices of coefficients can be treated than with bandwidth processing. The paper describes the solution process from the point of view of the engineer; a detailed description of the steps of the process is also provided for the use of a program developer. Speed tests of the computer code show that while a negligible time penalty is incurred in some cases, there is a great improvement in others when the new approach is compared with a bandwidth Choleski process. Accuracy tests of the code show that the error in the modified Gauss is less than 0.006% for a problem in which the Choleski routine has 38% error.

AB - A unique proposal for the construction of a cofferdam for repair work on the walls of a canal consists of a ring-reinforced steel barrel-vault with rubber bearing pads and seals at the edges and end. The general instability of the skin-ring combination commonly is checked by comparing the line load equivalent to a tributary length times the pressure with the ring-buckling line load. The ring in this case has its ends free to slide and in addition may be affected by eccentricity at the ends, by initial movement or elastic support of the ends or by out-of-roundness. These and other effects are analyzed and discussed with the problems of design of such a cofferdam in view.

AB - This paper presents nondimensional graphical solutions for the analysis and minimum weight design of various types of rectangular frames with simple or clamped supports subjected to compressive loadings. The solutions are generated by first expressing the weight and stability equation as nondimensional functions of the inertias. Employing the Lagrangian Multiplier Method results in the required functional relationships to define a minimum weight design. The analysis and design technique is illustrated by several examples.

AB - The support conditions used for roof shells are frequently markedly different from those necessary for analytical solution methods. Numerical methods provide the versatility to cope with the many possibilities that can occur, such as eccentric edge members and isolated supports. The finite-element method employing a curved parallelogram-shaped shallow shell element is presented. A displacement shape is used which provides slope continuity between elements. Due to tie inclusion of a complete rigid body motion, a small interelement discontinuity in the in-plane displacements is present. Accuracy of the solution obtained using the element is demonstrated by comparison with a series solution for the same problem. A skewed hyperbolic parabolid supported on buttresses is also solved.
