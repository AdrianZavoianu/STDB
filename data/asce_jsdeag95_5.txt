AB - Expressions are developed for the moments and deflections of simply-supported, prismatic beams subjected to various loading conditions simultaneous with ponding. These can be combined by a form of superposition to solve cases of combined loadings and different support conditions including continuous beams. The simply-supported beam problem is generalized by means of Fourier series to handle any loading condition plus initial crookedness. An examination of the analogy between the ponded beam and the vibrating beam problem reveals why the critical ponding factor is a function of end conditions and is independent of the type of applied load.

AB - A study of the convergence rates of finite-difference solutions of the linear thin shallow shell equations for single panel ruled surface hyperbolic paraboloids is reported. Boundary conditions of clamped, simply supported edges, free edges and edges elastically supported on edge beams are shown to have a considerable effect on the convergence rates. Using conventional finite-difference methods and an iterative method of solution, investigations with successively finer grids show that satisfactory convergence of in-plane actions is obtained on relatively coarse difference grids (grid spacings less than 8 in both directions over 1/4 of the shell area), and that convergence of moments and deflections require finer grids. Higher order boundary approximations and the modified finite-difference technique give slightly increased accuracy only at the expense of greatly increased computational effort.

AB - A finite segment method of analysis based on the ordinary theory of folded plates is presented. In this method the basic structural element is assumed to be formed by dividing each plate element into a finite number of segments longitudinally. Compatibility and equilibrium conditions are then satisfied at selected points along the four edges of each segment in the structure. A matrix progression procedure is used in solving the problem for imposed vertical, horizontal, longitudinal or rotational forces or displacements at the joints. Arbitrary end boundary conditions and interior diaphragm or column type supports may be treated. A generál computer program is developed and results for one example are described.

AB - Stresses and strains in reinforced concrete are determined by three-dimensional photoelastic analysis of models. The models simulate the steel reinforcement by near rigid rods in a less rigid matrix. Stresses and strains are obtained at the interface of the two materials and in the interior of the matrix. Three models are analyzed; a single rod in a large mass; two rods in a beam; and a rod with a hook at each end in a beam. The structures are analyzed for both shrinkage loading and mechanical loading. Recently developed techniques, which extend the three-dimensional photoelastic method to analysis of these two material bodies, are presented.

AB - Analytical procedures are presented for determining displacements and forces in a two-way network of prestressed cables subjected to static, out-of-plane loadings. An efficient and direct open-form technique, the walk-through method is used to solve the governing difference equation for a statically determinate net. This method is an improvement over those based on the solution to simultaneous equations in that considerably less calculation time is required. An iteration procedure which utilizes the walk-through method is introduced for the analysis of indeterminate networks in which the nonlinear effects cannot be neglected. Rapid convergence is obtained for a variety of conditions, some of which are highly discontinuous. The numerical examples illustrate an important advantage of the above procedures—a single computer program with only minor changes can be used to solve the various analysis and design problems associated with structural nets.

AB - A method for computing moment-thrust-curvature relations for reinforced concrete column sections in biaxial bending is described. The cross section is partitioned by a rectangular grid into a large number of small elemental areas of steel and concrete. For any given strain distribution in the section, summation of elemental forces acting on the elemental areas and summation of the moments of the elemental forces yield the corresponding applied force and moments. An iterative search procedure is used to find the strain distribution, and hence the curvature, which correspond to a given loading condition. The method has been developed for computer calculation. General bending of members of irregular cross section can also be treated using this technique.

AB - A detailed analysis of the behavior of thin-walled open sections under eccentric loading is presented, with emphasis on singly-symmetric sections loaded in the plane of symmetry. It is shown that for a given shape, depending on eccentricity and slenderness, a variety of behavior modes is possible: continuous purely flexural beam-column behavior, flexural instability, torsional-flexural instability and, in exceptional cases, purely torsional instability. The purpose of this paper is the development of accurate design methods and procedures. For most practically important open shapes yielding by simple flexural beam-column action governs when the load is applied on the side of the shear center opposite from that of the centroid. If the load is applied on the open side of the section, or between shear center and centroid, failure can be by torsional-flexural instability, by yielding in the beam-column mode, or by flexural instability. Experimental investigation is in very satisfactory agreement with theory.

AB - Light gage steel panels often are used as wall cladding or roof decking of steel framed structures. These interconnected panels act as diaphragms which can resist shear and, therefore, brace the members to which they are attached if proper connection is provided between the diaphragms and the members. When used as wall cladding the panels usually are fastened to horizontal girts which in turn are connected to the columns. A reliable theory and computational procedure is presented for obtaining critical loads of columns with such diaphragm-girt bracing. This critical load can be the same as that of a column having an effective length equal to the girt spacing. The theory has been verified by tests, and can serve as the basis for the development of suitable design procedures for diaphragm-girt bracing.

AB - A simple method of analysis is presented for torsionally loaded perforated shafts. This difficult topic is presented for the first time in a manner suitable for use in engineering offices. The internal forces, the twist and the period of the free torsional vibrations are found to depend on a single, dimensionless, parameter, which is denoted as torsional stiffness parameter of the shaft. The use of dimensionless coefficients makes it possible to find the general solution and to express it in explicit form. Moreover, it is recognized that there exists a complete mathematical analogy between the torsionally loaded shaft and the laterally loaded shear wall. This, it is expected, will simplify future research in the theory of building structures.

AB - The stability of partially embedded foundation piles was first investigated by Granholm of the University of Stockholm (2).3 Granholm, upon developing an expression for the condition of buckling, proceeded to find its solution by means of an approximate method. The modulus of the foundation was calculated based on an assumed value for its rigidity. Experimental verification was conducted using thin-walled tubular brass specimens partially embedded in a clay foundation. The critical loads were in every case less than calculated values due, in part, to a complication of local buckling, particularly for shorter specimens. A relation was then found incorporating the local buckling effects, which fairly well represented the laboratory results. This technical note reports an investigation of the same problem, but the elastic foundation is assumed to be of the Winkler type and prismatic bars are used to avoid local buckling. The experimental results appear to confirm the analytical prediction.

AB - One of the most fundamental problems in earthquake engineering is to properly determine the intensity or strength of an earthquake. Such intensity may be defined as a function of variables characterizing the excitation or the structure, or both, and thus can be used in direct response computations. So far there has been no unique definition for the earthquake intensity, although Housner's definition (5)2 seems to be the one most commonly used. The recent tendencies in research activities as well as industrial practices to use stochastic representations for the earthquake accelerations (1,6,7,13) and probabilistic methods of analysis for the structural response (4,8) have imposed considerable confusion and difficulty in properly defining the groundmotion intensity. It is the purpose of this technical note to study and compare various earthquake intensity definitions and to describe their applicability. Emphasis is placed on finding the time-varying rms accelerations of existing strong-motion earthquake records and several simulating stationary and nonstationary random models of earthquakes.

The mechanisms of failure in simple angle ties and struts, relating them to available published test results and to some small test programs undertaken to illustrate certain types of behavior are described herein.
