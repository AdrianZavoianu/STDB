AB - Safety or reliability of a structure is formulated in terms of an uncertainty factor combined with a generalized allowable risk. The uncertainty factor allows the consideration of incomplete information and imperfect knowledge in the specification of a permissible risk level. This allows the use of judgment and the explicit use of probabilistic information in the design of safe structures.

AB - The curve representing the elastic axis may consist of straight sections, curved sections, or both, and may have a locus of points lying in a plane or in three-space. Each differential element of the elastic axis is given six degrees of freedom, namely, three translations and three rotations. Three shears and three moments are assumed to act at each point of the elastic axis. In passing to the limit as all segment lengths simultaneously approach zero, the general element becomes a flexibility influence function. The results of the method are illustrated through the derivation of the flexibility influence functions associated with a circular beam with uniform stiffness. Mention is also made of how the procedure presented may be applied to special beam problems.

AB - In pile driving, it is usually necessary to include cushioning material between the striking ram and the helmet and, in the case of concrete piles, between the helmet and head of the pile. These cushions are used to reduce the level of impact forces developed by the driving hammer, to prevent excessive stresses in the driving hammer, and to eliminate spalling of the concrete at the end of the pile. The mechanical properties of various cushions are investigated herein. Laboratory investigations were made to determine the dynamic properties of the cushions tested. The results are tabulated for several cushion types and are checked by means of a mathematical solution.

AB - Deflection stability problems of fixed-pinned beams under variable repeated moving load are treated both theoretically and experimentally. The results are compared with the ultimate load which causes the beams to fail by beam mechanism and with the shake-down load under variable repeated fixed point loading. Sixteen beams with span length of 39 in. (ten rectangular and six I beams) were tested under static and repeated loadings. Stabilized deflection due to the moving loading are usually larger than the values due to the fixed point loading for the rectangular beams, while for the I beams the stabilized deflection-load curves under the two loading conditions become close each other. The theoretical finding of the load-deflection behaviors is also confirmed by the test results.

AB - The problem of the effective width, which is encountered in the design of steel plate deck bridges, is presented and examined theoretically. The differential equation of the correlated plane state of loading in the deck-plate is obtained taking in consideration the effect of the mutually perpendicular stiffeners. A solution for the equation is given and the effective width is calculated. Formulas and tables of the effective width are presented for the case of sine-wave loading on the main girders. The behavior of the effective width of the steel deck-plate is presented showing that in addition to the usual factors governing the effective width of isotropic flanges, the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the longitudinal stiffeners to the cross-sectional area of the skin-plate has a significant effect.

AB - The effects of a number of representative types of imperfection on the elastic deformations of simply supported I-beams with either equal end moments or central concentrated load are investigated, and it is shown that each of these imperfections can be approximated by an equivalent sinusoidal initial crookedness or twist. The results of this investigation are then used in an examination of a linear plot method of extrapolating for the elastic critical load devised by Massey, and it is concluded that the plots obtained by this method may be nonlinear. An improved method of extrapolation is suggested and the critical load estimates made by this method from a number of experimental measurements are compared with the Massey plot estimates and the theoretical predictions.

AB - Formulas for the elastic buckling loads of shear diaphragms are derived. They are obtained from an analysis of light-gage, corrugated-metal diaphragms of the type that occur in pre-engineered metal buildings. The formulas are applicable to any rectangular, orthotropic plate loaded in pure shear, and they are derived using orthotropic plate theory and the Ritz energy method. Small deflection theory is used first to establish critical loads and buckling modes. Then, large deflection theory is used to predict post-buckling load versus lateral deflection relationships. The results of experiments that were designed to verify the accuracy of the formulas are presented in the form of load versus lateral deflection curves covering the pre and post-buckling ranges. Several light-gage, corrugated-metal diaphragms of different size and corrugation shape were tested to determine their buckling behavior. The results of the experiments compare favorably with the formulas derived.

AB - Box girder bridge decks have recently come into wider use. This is of particular interest in the case of suspension bridges where deck form strongly affects the possible response to wind action. The present paper determines and compares aerodynamic (flutter) stability coefficients for five representative box girder bridge decks. In addition, data on a modern truss-stiffened bridge and a classical girder-stiffened one are included. Two deck forms having more gradual flow-splitting characteristics are much more favorable than other decks from a flutter stability standpoint. The deck forms in question resemble the published sections of the Severn and Lillebaelt suspension bridges, respectively.

AB - The most common type of structural fatigue test program is the experimental construction of an S-N curve and may be divided into two phases: determination of the mean fatigue limit by the staircase method; and determination of the finite life region and its subsequent analysis by regression analysis. The bases for statistical design of experiments require both randomization and, generally, replication. Randomization in sampling of material, specimen assignment to stress levels, and test sequence minimizes the effects of possible bias due to uncontrolled variation in material, laboratory environment, and test procedures. Replication of tests at a given stress level to estimate variability in fatigue life is often impractical. The variability in life may be estimated from regression analysis and used to predict probability of survival at any stress level.

AB - Numerical solutions are presented concerning the influence of vehicle speed and roadway live load camber on the dynamic bending moments and deflections of a rapid-transit bridge traversed by a rapid-transit vehicle. The vehicle is simulated as a four-degree-of-freedom lumped parameter system, whereas the bridge is considered as a simply supported beam in dynamic flexure with inertia and equivalent distributed viscous damping in the formulation of the governing equations of motion. For the rapid-transit system considered, it is found that higher speeds produce higher maximum bending moments and deflections; camber is slightly beneficial at high cruising speeds (50 mph-60 mph) but in general it results in larger maximum and rms displacements and bending moments at low cruising speeds (20 mph-30 mph). The solutions also show that negative bending moments and deflections occur at these speeds in contrast to the static analysis (zero speed) in which the bending moments are always positive and the deflections downward.
