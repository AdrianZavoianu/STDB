AB - Static tests of a scale model horizontally curved highway bridge are reported. A plexiglas model of an existing two span curved girder highway interchange facility was used for the tests. The fabrication techniques used in construction of the model are described. The model was tested in two stages. In the first stage a grid system consisting of two curved girders interconnected by diaphragms was subjected to concentrated static loads located at various positions along the two girders. In the second stage, a deck slab was added and the model was again tested under static loading. In each test, centerline deflections of the two girders and strains at various locations on the bridge cross section were measured. The measured deflections and strains were compared with values obtained from a computer program for two span horizontally curved bridge structures. In general, the measured deflections and strains were found to be in reasonable agreement with the calculated values.

AB - The analysis of the dynamic response of single span, horizontally curved bridges subject to moving forcing systems comprised of sprung and unsprung mass components is described. The bridge is considered to be a continuous, elastic system of thin-walled open cross section. An exact solution to the governing partial differential equations is obtained in the form of an infinite series. The solution is programmed on a digital computer, and a comparison is made between the computed and measured response of a laboratory model. The effect of the mass and velocity of the load upon the dynamic displacements and upon bending and twisting moments is analyzed.

AB - An experimental study was conducted to develop prediction formulas for the ultimate capacity of single-angle single-bolted connections as used in tower and power substation structures. The following factors were considered in the investigation: (1) End and edge distances to the center of the connection hole; (2) thickness of material; and (3) yield and ultimate strength of the material. Angles made from medium and high strength steels were used. The results indicate that failure through either end or edge is a distinct function of end and edge distance and can be reasonably predicted from the formulas developed. Bearing stress equal to 2.25 times the yield stress can produce insignificant hole elongation depending upon the end and edge distances. It is also shown that the development of local stresses in the immediate neighborhood of the hole, equal to or greater than the yield stress, is not a reliable indication of approaching failure of the connection.

AB - The damping characteristic of a particular designed damper was measured. Test set-up and the experimental procedures are discussed. Tests were carried out at a constant frequency and amplitude. The effect of temperature and short term fatigue on the proper ties of the dampers were studied. Generation of heat and its dissipation are calculated. In discussion of the results, the importance of fast dissipation of heat from the viscoelastic material is emphasized. The results are presented in tables and graphs.

AB - Low-cycle fatigue damage factors are computed for single-degree-of-freedom systems subjected to accelerograms of the El Centro earthquake (NS component) of May 18,1940 and the Taft earthquake (S69°E component) of July 21, 1952. Two interrelated hysteresis loops, namely, load-maximum strain curve and deflection-maximum strain curve, are proposed for columns with an average wide-flange section. These hysteresis loops are used for finding the time history of maximum strains in the shear type frame under earthquake loads. The history of plastic strains are then used to compute the corresponding cumulative damage factor of the structure. Variables studies include frequency (in the elastic range) and the yield load of the structure. Numerical results show that (a) it is possible for a structure to fail in low-cycle fatigue under seismic loads, and (b) this type of structural failure cannot be predicted just by studying the maximum structural displacements of the structure.

AB - A study of the influence of P-Δ and axial deformation of columns on the response of unbraced multistory building frames subjected to strong earthquake motion is presented. The columns are assumed to behave elastically while the girders follow a nonlinear moment-curvature behavior defined by a Ramberg-Osgood function. The method of analysis is a step-by-step numerical procedure developed for use on a high-speed digital computer. The lateral response of the structure to a horizontal component of ground motion parallel to the plane of the frame is computed. Two 10- and 25-story frame models are analyzed for the El Centro, 1940, and the Taft, July, 1952, earthquakes. The results indicate that, for the type of structures considered, the P-Δ effect does not appear to have a significant influence on their inelastic response to strong earthquakes. But the axial deformation of columns may affect the response by as much as 10% to 20%.

AB - The bending of beams supported by an elastic medium is analyzed using photoelasticity. Four models were considered: (1) A model representing a beam of infinite length with a concentrated control load; (2) a finite beam with a central load; (3) a finite beam with a load at the quarter point; and (4) a finite beam with two concentrated loads at the two quarter points. The bending moments, shears and contact pressures were obtained and compared with corresponding values for beams resting on a Winkler-type foundation. Several alternative ways of determining the pressure distribution at the surface of contact are presented. The analysis includes the stress distribution in the elastic medium.

AB - Suggestions for the design, testing and installation of aluminum formed-sheet building sheathing are given. Formulas for allowable stresses, generally based on compressive crippling, are presented. For trapezoidal sections, weighted-average allowable stresses based on the characteristics of both flange elements and web elements are used. Allowable loads for sheathing of a complex cross-sectional shape can be established through bending tests of sample panels. Other design considerations such as fastener strength, web crippling strength and deflections are covered. A section on installation procedures gives recommendations aimed at insuring trouble-free service. A commentary provides background information on strength provisions, factors of safety and test methods.

AB - The probability of a plastic collapse failure for a structure of random material strength acted on by random loads can be evaluated considering that failure may occur by any one of the possible failure mechanisms for the structure. A single-bay single-story structure acted on by wind and snow loads is considered. Probability distributions are selected for the loads and for the yield strength of the structural material. The probability of failure for the frame can be closely approximated by using the sum of the probabilities of failure for the individual mechanisms for those frames in which a single failure mechanism has considerably higher PF than PF for the other possible failure mechanisms. For the case in which two or more individual failure mechanisms have near equally high probabilities of failure, the PF for the frame can be closely approximated by the sum of the PF for individual mechanisms minus the probabilities of the intersection of those events that have individually high probabilities of occurring.
