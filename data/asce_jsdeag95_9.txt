AB - The best practice requires that unequivocal statements of all the steps to be executed in a computer program exist separately from the actual coded instructions. These statements should furnish the link between the engineer-developer of a program and those responsible for the preparation of a computer solution. It is unlikely that many persons will possess expert knowledge to fulfill both functions; nor should this be necessary. A flow diagram containing the statements described previously, when properly executed, dispenses both the engineer and the coder from any necessary intelligence of the other's function. The former has the responsibility to insure that the flow diagram represents a sound engineering solution to the stated problem while the latter must develop a set of computer instructions that is a practical as well as a faithful representation of that flow diagram.

AB - As coders make numerous decisions, for the most part individually trivial but collectively significant, their effect on the efficiency of a computer program suggests that more than a superficial ability is required. Their principal function is the accurate and effective translation of hardware-independent flow diagrams into a language acceptable to a specific machine configuration. To do this requires a thorough knowledge of that particular computer's capabilities so as to best utilize whatever advantages the hardware may possess. The judicious selection of the language to be used makes a corresponding demand to know the implementation features of the available software. The higher the language level selected, the more the actual coding resembles the flow diagram and the less flexibility is permitted or ingenuity required of the coder. It is not inconceivable that the flow chart will become virtually identical with some more sophisticated languages so that the present role of the coder will remain only in software development.

AB - Axial-compression tests on 12 cruciform shapes made from ASTM A514 steel plates demonstrated the need to limit the ratio of the flange projection to the flange thickness (b/t) to about 5 in A514 steel to achieve yielding followed by sustained plastic strain (over 3% strain before gradual unloading), and to ensure suitability of A514 steel compression elements for plastic design. The critical plastic local buckling stress for A514 steel members with (b/t) &lt; 5 can be accurately computed from the deformation-theory equation, σc = σy + Et [0.385 (t/b)2—0.005] by using values of σy and ET measured in tension tests, and conservatively computed by using σy = 100,000 psi (the minimum specified for A514 steel) and Et = 220,000 psi. Similarly, the strain corresponding to maximum stress can be predicted approximately by the deformation-theory equation, c = 0.385 (t/b)2.

AB - To determine how variations in the geometric ratios of b/t (the flange width is 2b) and L/ry affect the ability of A514-steel members to fulfill the requirements for plastic design, seven A514 steel I-shaped beams were tested in pure bending and two others were tested as centrally loaded beams in which the moment varied linearly from zero to maximum between bracing points. The moment-gradient and pure-bending tests simulated, respectively, first-forming and last-forming plastic hinges of frames. Both the pure-bending and moment-gradient tests indicated that A514 steel has sufficient rotation capacity for its use in plastically designed structures loaded in this way. The tests also indicated that premature plastic buckling of A514 steel I-shaped members will not occur if the value of b/t is limited to 5 and if the value of L/ry is limited to 21 for uniform-moment regions and 36 when the moment varies linearly from zero to maximum over the unbraced length.

AB - The results of analytical and experimental studies of constructional alloy (A514) steel bolted joints show that A514 steel joints using high strength bolts do not produce desirable behavior in their members if the elements of the joints are designed according to current (1968) practice. The study shows that the ratio of net area to gross member area and the ratio of net area to total bolt shear area need to be considered in the design of A514 steel tension members. Some type of upset end, such as an increase in plate width or thickness in the region of the joint can be used to provide the required net to gross member area to insure yielding of the gross cross section before the ultimate load of the joint is reached.

AB - Study made of available data on diagonal tension cracking in reinforced concrete beams with and without axial load. Increment of shear between calculated flexural cracking and observed diagonal tension cracking was found to be a function of flexural reinforcement ratio, p, and modular ratio, n. In the study, 31 reinforced concrete beams were tested under combined transverse load and axial load, including both tension and compression. Results obtained confirm the conclusions reached as result of study of previously available test data. Two modified forms of Equation 26-12 of the ACI Building Code, AC1 318-63, are proposed as applicable to both prestressed concrete and reinforced concrete with or without axial load.

AB - The method proposed represents an analytical way of the superposition of mechanisms having three distinct advantages in comparison with the classical Symonds and Neale method. First, the equations of virtual work are set forth only for elementary mechanisms; secondly, superposition of mechanism is performed entirely analytically and thirdly, the procedure makes it sure that all possible collapse modes are considered. The objective function is defined as a nondimensional collapse load being a function of modal ratios. The actual collapse load, determined as the minimal value of the objective function, is obtained through a simple comparison of a finite number of its numerical values. Being analytical in nature the proposed method is suitable for the application of computers in case of large numbers of possible collapse modes. Two examples illustrate the exposed procedure.

Impact of these advances resulted in some changes in design philosophy, reflected on steel specifications and codes of many countries. Tentative revisions on ASCE Manual No. 41 Plastic Design in Steel and AISC Specification are summarized prior to their publication scheduled for fall, 1969. Paper indicates problems associated with plastic design that need further investigation. Trends in design practice are also presented.

AB - A study by three-dimensional photoelasticity of the behavior of a 1/50 scale structural system made up of intersecting plates, modeling a reinforced-concrete ground-level liquid-storage tank covered by a column-supported flat-plate roof forty foot square in plan is reported. The model is used to observe both the overall response and the detailed stress concentrations at plate intersections and openings and at the column top. Experimental design and test details, and the validity and accuracy of the model approach are discussed. Results from the test indicated that the PCA tables are not adequate for many practical tank designs. Maximum corner moments differed by a factor of 3 from the tabulated data used in design, and the distribution of these moments was entirely dissimilar.

AB - Simply supported multibeam bridges with elements of solid or box section are considered. The structure is idealized as a series of discrete beams, which may include edge beams, joined by longitudinal hinges. The structure is analyzed by a computer-oriented direct flexibility technique, using harmonic analysis to reduce the two-dimensional problem to a series of one-dimensional problems. A design-oriented computer program which has been developed to apply the method is described and a detailed example is presented.
