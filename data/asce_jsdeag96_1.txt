AB - The need for a new look at transmission line design because of the new and higher voltages that are being used is described. Vertical, transverse and longitudinal loads and their effects are considered with emphasis on a correct assignment of the wind load. Tower design is described together with the importance of considering material cost, fabrication cost, cost of transportation, erection cost, foundation cost and maintenance cost. Foundations and soil borings are noted together with illustrations of the method of constructing the augured concrete caisson type. Fabrication of the steel tower and relation to the tower design is given in detail. Construction and inspection and their relation to the successful fulfillment of a good design and line performance are covered.

AB - Two FORTRAN programs prepared to aid in the preliminary design of unbraced multistory frames are described. The first program has two phases. Phase I, Tabulation of Design Data, accepts data about the geometry of the structure and general load patterns and translates this into loads on individual members based on the tributary areas supported by the members. The program handles regular-shaped rectangular frames up to eight bays and 48 stories. A punched output serves as input to Phase II. Phase II, Girder Moments and Moment Balance, takes the frame geometry and loading on the structure and prepares listings of the required plastic moments for girders and of controlling values for moment diagrams for girders and columns. Thrusts in each column are also listed. Listings are for gravity load and gravity plus wind from two directions. The second program, Subassemblage Method of Analysis, evaluates the load versus sway characteristics of a single story of a frame already designed. Numerical results plus a digital plot are obtained.

AB - The general solution of the plane-stress problem for an elastic body exhibiting cylindrical anisotropy is used with a point-matching technique to obtain the distribution of stresses in curved timber beams of variable depth. In a numerical example, the stresses and strains in a glued-laminated beam of variable cross section are obtained for the case of a uniform load. The numerical procedure is shown to converge rapidly, and the strains predicted by the theory are confirmed by experimental strain-gage measurements.

AB - The most efficient means of solving most systems of linear equations arising in structural analysis is by Gaussian elimination and subsequent back substitution. A method is presented for its implementation. Direct solutions are obtained with sparse matrix factors which preserve the operations of the Gaussian elimination for repeat solutions. The method together with techniques for its application are graphically described. Its use in many types of engineering problems requiring solutions to systems of linear equations will: (1) Minimize the amount of central computer memory required; (2) provide a more flexible means of manipulating large matrices; and (3) dramatically reduce computer time.

AB - A method of analysis, based on the Donnell-Jenkins shell equations, is presented by which a tubular cylindrical shell may be analyzed for any input loading or displacement pattern. Four computer programs which have been developed, based on this method of analysis, are described. The computer programs are then used to study typical tubular tee-joints in which a number of different assumptions are made as to the distribution of loading imposed on the chord tube by the web tube. The results are compared and analyzed with respect to the validity of presently used design assumptions. Finally, analytical results obtained by the computer are compared to those obtained from a case which has been previously studied experimentally.

AB - The twisting moments in a spandrel and the bending moments in a slab, butting into it and uniformly loaded, are relaxed by the rotation and the horizontal and vertical displacements of the spandrel, as well as by the rotation of the columns. The influence of these relaxations may be significant and can be assessed by the tables of effective widths, slab bending moments, and spandrel twisting moments given in this paper.

AB - The Bernoulli's hypothesis of plane cross sections remaining perpendicular to the deformed center line does not adequately approximate the deformation due to the torsion of a long prismatic shell (or thin-walled structure with open cross section). Due to the warping, the pure torsion gives rise to the occurrence of normal stresses in longitudinal direction. In order to simplify the analysis, a specific design model standing in between a long shell and a classical beam is introduced. The matrix force method proves to be a powerful tool for the analysis of such thin-walled members. The flexibility, transformation, and equilibrium matrices are derived. Two different techniques of matrix force method are presented in detail. Through a limiting process (when the torsional rigidity approaches zero) it is shown that the suggested procedure presents the generalization of the method used in the case of solid beam assemblages.

AB - This work is concerned with an application of the conjugate gradient method (6)2 to the maximization of eigenvalues of trusses under the condition of constant structural weight. The conjugate gradient method is used in two different contexts herein: in phase 1, as the algorithm that determines the changes to be introduced to the structural configuration, and phase 2, as the basic algorithm used for reanalysis of the eigenvalues of successively modified designs.
