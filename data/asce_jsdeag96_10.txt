AB - The general solution to the plane stress problem for a cylindrically orthotropic beam is used, with a point-matching technique, to analyze the radial stresses in pitched and tapered, glued-laminated timber beams. Maximum values for these radial stresses are given for several geometrical configurations. The currently used design method is found to underestimate the stresses when the beam has variable depth.

AB - Thirteen wood-concrete composite T-beams were fabricated and tested. Epoxy resin was used to bond the wood web to the concrete flange. By proper design, it was possible to stress the concrete in compression and the wood in tension as long as the bond between wood and concrete remained effective. It was found that the beams function as composite sections and carry substantial loads before failure. Four failure modes are identified: Sliding shear, beam shear, tensile wood failure and concrete compressive failure. Beams glued while the concrete was fresh performed at least as well as beams glued after the concrete had set. Longitudinal nails used as additional shear connectors substantially increase the horizontal shear resistance between wood and concrete. Reinforcing wood strips also increase the sliding shear resistance. The effect of other variables remain to be considered.

AB - An evaluation is made of bridge deck survey findings and laboratory research data in order to characterize the most common types of bridge deck deterioration. Possible causes are identified from the findings of published bridge deck surveys. The most widely accepted mechanisms of deterioration and related results of research on concrete fracture are described. The thermal incommpatibility mechanism and structural cracking mechanism are introduced to explain certain laboratory tests results and observed bridge deck deterioration. The use of revibration, nonrusting reinforcement; polymerized concrete, mixes with improved resistance to early cracking, and the adoption of improved methods of mixture quality control and aggregate selection are suggested as possible preventatives.

AB - The displacements of the boundaries of skewed and curved bridges resulting from temperature change of the bridge deck depend on the lateral support system of the superstructure. To avoid high internal stresses in a redundant lateral support system due to temperature change of the superstructure, and to predict the boundary displacements, a statically determinate lateral support system is proposed. Equations are derived to compute the boundary displacements for the determinate lateral support system and suggestions are made for a suitable arrangement of this system. The effect on the displacements is presented for two different lateral support systems. The use of a statically determinate lateral support system permits the computation of the temperature displacements and the lateral support forces of the superstructure for the correct design of bearings.

AB - Step—integration techniques have often been used to obtain dynamic responses in highway bridges without regard to efficiency or to the errors they incur. Quantitative estimates for the discretization errors are given for Newmark's method, the fourth order Milne and Hamming methods, and the Adams methods of orders two through six. These errors are given with respect to the single and multi—axle sprung wheel loads which traverse an elastic beam at constant velocity. Because all error relations are given as functions of the product of the step size and the fundamental bridge frequency, it is possible to select a step size for a specific bridge—vehicle system which will yield a predetermined accuracy in the maximum midspan response or for the maximum expected error throughout the entire solution. The mechanism of how the actual error propagates is also defined and compared with a classical error bounding technique.

AB - A method is presented for the analysis of plane prestressed cable trusses of the type used for suspended roof structures. The structures are composed of simple tension members, simple compression members and shallow cable members. In the analysis, the structure is assumed elastic and is treated as a discrete system and the members are assumed incapable of resisting being. Static loading, temperature effects and support movements are considered. The governing nonlinear equations are derived and an iterative method of solution (a modified Newton-Raphson method) is developed for determining the joint displacements and the member forces corresponding to the equilibrium state. A computer program based on this method was prepared and several numerical examples were solved. Three types of prestressed cable trusses are studied in the numerical examples (including the type developed by Jawerth) and their performance and efficiency are compared.

AB - A step-by-step linear incremental procedure for large deflection analyses of plates on elastic foundations using finite elements is presented. The incremental stiffness matrices for a conforming rectangular plate finite element, which are appropriate for large deflection analysis, are formulated and presented explicitly. Evaluative analyses are made by using the incremental stiffness formulations and piecewise incremental procedures. Examples include uniformly loaded rectangular plates with different length-to-width ratios, various boundary conditions and foundation moduli. Comparisons are made in those cases where the alternative analytic solutions are available. Good agreements are found.

The effects of concrete strength, steel percentage, slenderness ratio, eccentricity and partial prestressing were considered. The results indicate that long eccentrically loaded columns can be significantly increased by sustained loading. In addition the prestressing force in the column may be reduced appreciably under sustained loading.

AB - The ultimate load of axially loaded concrete filled steel tube columns was investigated and design equations are proposed which are based on summing the tangent modulus buckling loads of the concrete core and the steel tube. The tangent modulus loads are calculated using the AISC code method for the steel tube and a parabolic stress-strain relationship for the concrete. The proposed design equations are shown to give reasonable agreement when compared with test results and it is shown that other design formulae do not give better agreement. A method for calculating the limits of slenderness ratio which determine whether an increase in concrete strength due to triaxial confinement is likely is also given.

AB - Nonsymmetric vibrations of thin cylindrical shells have been studied using Flüg's theory. Both fixed—fixed and clamped—clamped boundary conditions are included in the study. When displacements are assumed to have the same form as those of a corresponding simply supported shell with harmonic axial forces or moments, or both, applied along both edges, two separate characteristic frequency equations, depending upon whether an even or odd number of axial modes exist, can be obtained by satisfying the necessary boundary conditions. Natural frequencies may then be searched for within the magnitudes of two consecutive frequencies of even or odd axial wave modes of the corresponding simply supported cylinder. Numerical results obtained are in good agreement with the existing experiments. This analysis shows that the present method of approach can easily be extended to analyze nonsymmetric vibrations of cylindrical shells with different type of edge conditions.

AB - A nonlinear analysis of an electric transmission line is presented for conditions involving imbalance in conductor tensions. The analysis is applicable to lines containing structures of arbitrary geometry and stiffnesses. Structure and insulator displacements are considered. Stiffness properties of structures, conductors, and insulators are derived. Equilibrium equations to be used in the analysis are formed. Two numerical methods of analysis, an iteration method, and a step-by-step linear increment technique are applied to the equilibrium equations. Both methods which have been programmed on a digital computer are applied to an actual transmission line containing flexible tubular steel structures. The iteration method has been found to be superior to the step-by-step method for the example analyzed. Analysis of this line has also shown that neglecting deflections of flexible structures with suspension insulators introduces substantial error.

AB - Information obtained in an investigation of the effects of heat curving, and the results of a subsequent analysis of the bending behavior of heat-curved members, have been used to formulate criteria for heat curving rolled beams and welded girders. Two of the main provisions of the criteria are the requirements for: (1) A minimum radius; and (2) an increase in the usual vertical camber. The minimum-radius requirement was selected to prevent excessive web bowing due to the combined effects of the residual compressive stresses and shear stresses from applied loads. The requirement for increase in camber was selected to negate vertical residual deflections, or loss in camber, as a result of slight inelastic action under initial loading. A specification for heat curving, essentially in accordance with the criteria analyzed in this paper, was recently (1969) adopted by AASHO.
