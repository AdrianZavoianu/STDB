AB - The use of high-strength thin steel tubes filled with expansive cement concrete results in the fabrication of very efficient composite columns. An optimization study shows that the condition for achieving maximum elastic range during loading of such columns is that the ratio between the longitudinal and the circumferential stresses in the steel tube developed prior to loading, due either to expansion or other means of prestressing, should be the same as that induced by the loading. Results obtained in previous investigations shows that the ratio of circumferential to longitudinal stresses in the steel tube due to expansion of the concrete prior to loading is considerably larger than that induced during loading. The writers investigated experimentally the use of circumferential prestressing of the empty steel tube for improving such a ratio. The evaluation of the results obtained in the experiments carried out on four short high-strength thin-wall steel tubes, proved the validity of the results obtained in the optimization studies and shows that the initial prestressing not only increases the available elastic range of the composite element for service load but also increases its inelastic range with consequent improvement of ultimate strength, ductility and energy absorption capacity.

AB - A computer oriented method is described for the analysis of frames with partially rigid beam-to-column connections. The moment-rotation relationship for the partially rigid connections is approximated by a bilinear model. Slopes of these models are graphically determined and used to define connection rigidities. Element stiffness matrices are derived which include the effect of these partial rigidities. The modified element stiffness matrices are then used in a direct stiffness method of solution. Analysis for stability of frames with partial connection rigidity is carried out using the classical method of determining bifurcation states. The modified element stiffness matrices incorporating the effects of partial connection rigidities are directly used in the analysis. Problems ranging from rigid frames to pin connected frames can be solved by the same appproach and examples are presented to show the results.

AB - Results of a large scale study of orthotropic elastic properties of wood are presented. The general theory for elastic behavior of wood is presented for compression loading at general angles to ring and grain. Experimental work, for four species of wood, utilizing a total of 588 specimens is presented. Comparison of theoretical and measured strain is provided and a statistical analysis of the data is developed. Agreement between the theoretical and experimental strain was reasonably good for loading within a principal orthotropic plane; however, large errors seem to exist for general loading out of the principal planes. The study suggests new research efforts are needed to incorporate the nonhomogeneous characteristics of wood in the theory. Refined experimental techniques are also needed to better evaluate the elastic behavior of wood loaded at general angles to the orthotropic axes.

AB - A theoretical assessment of dynamic response of arch dams due to earthquakes is attempted using the finite element shell formulation. The results of the analysis reveal that seismic forces can induce high tensile stresses in arch dams and therefore these forces should be given serious consideration in aseismic design. The dam is idealized as an assemblage of rectangular elements with consistent mass distribution and viscous damping. The reservoir is taken into account by considering the added mass. The response to ground accelerations is then evaluated by step-by-step integration of governing differential equations assuming a certain variation of dam acceleration within a short time interval. The method is stable and provides greater economy in computing time than does the normal mode method. The response for a particular dam (Type 5, specified by the Institution of Civil Engineers, England) is obtained for three earthquakes-El Centro, May 18, 1940, N-S; Santa Barbara, June 30, 1941, N45E, and Taft, July 21, 1952, S69E.

AB - In this paper a numerical method to determine stress distribution around arbitrarily shaped openings in shells is outlined. For the application of this method, shell governing differential equations must first be written for an arbitrary orthogonal coordinate system. Later, this coordinate system is transformed into another coordiante system using a proper transformation function to treat any arbitrary opening shape. Then a numerical method is used to solve the resulting equations. Using the equations of shallow thin shell theory, the method is applied to a circular cylindrical shell with a circular hole along perimeter of which a unit moment is applied. The variations of stress resultants are given and they are compared with an available solution.

AB - A relatively simple, accurate method for the complete determination of internal moments, shears, and deflections in concrete box girder bridges with statically applied external vertical loads has been developed and is described. The method of analysis used is based on the concept of replacing the actual structure by an equivalent uniform plate which models the behavior of the actual structure. The objectives of the study, which are analyzed in detail, are (1) A discussion of the basis and applicability of the analysis of box girder bridges by sandwich plate theory; (2) presentation and solution of the governing equations for the boundary conditions and loadings considered; (3) the development of procedures for computing governing stiffness parameters; and (4) presentation of results derived for a sample structure and comparision of predicted beam bending moments with corresponding quantities measured in a full scale field test bridge.

AB - A method, implemented in a FORTRAN program, is developed for plastic design of both braced and unbraced multistory steel frames including a consideration of elastic stress and elastic deflection constraints. It is applicable to the design of rectangular multistory planar steel frames with coplanar loading. The method consists of three parts. The plastic analysis and design part follows a story-by-story optimization technique to determine a favorable force distribution in the frame in order to minimize steel cost. Member selection is in accordance with the 1969 AISC Manual of Steel Construction Specifications. An iterative design procedure is used to account for the P - Δ effect. The elastic analysis and elastic stress design part utilizes an exact matrix stiffness analysis and redesigns members to satisfy user imposed elastic stress constraints. Finally, the elastic stiffness design part follows a story-by-story optimization technique to redesign members in order to satisfy user imposed elastic lateral deflection constraints while minimizing steel cost increases. Example problems are presented which indicate the practicality of the design system.

AB - Present design practice of wood columns is reviewed. The derivation of the design expression adopted by National Design Specifications for wood structures is given and its limitations and range of applications are analyzed. Two methods of design are given: (1) Hand calculations, which is based on successive approximations; (2) a general computer program, for which the coding is also given. The latter renders all possible solutions in stress graded lumber of laminated wood for a given case. The sections are listed in ascending order of cost, least weight sections being listed first. The design of braced and unbraced columns with various end restraints is examined using the concept of effective length to determine actual slenderness. Present design practice renders conservative results for braced columns. However, in the case of unbraced columns, unless the actual slenderness is used, unsafe sections may result. Therefore, adoption of design provisions calling for use of actual slenderness and a minimum eccentricity of the load about both axes of bending are strongly recommended.

AB - Methods of analysis are presented which permit the rapid evaluation of overall reliability of complex redundant structural systems made up of components and subject to loads described by the linear combinations of continuous, random statistical variables. Structures in this category include fail safe designs; and trusses, frames, plates and shells analyzed by ultimate or limit design methods. The particular example chosen to show this capability is the indeterminate frame structure subject to moment induced plastic hinge failure mechanisms. In particular, approximate methods of reliability analysis are developed which consider explicitly the correlation between interrelated failure modes. Excellent agreement with exact results are achieved. Both normal and non-normal statistical distribution are considered in detail. A number of examples are presented which demonstrate the practicality of reliability base structural design.

AB - The analytic solution for static bending in stranded conductors is derived for the following cases of conductor supports: (1) Conductors with and without armor rod reinforcement; (2) conventional suspension clamps with bell mouths; and (3) unequal sag angles on either side. Rigorous solutions are reduced to simplified forms for ease of computation. Over a wide range of test conditions, calculated static bending strains are in good agreement with those determined experimentally. Overhead power conductors and other taut cables exposed to wind-induced transverse vibration are susceptible to fatigue failures, particularly at supports. The vibration fatigue life of such cables decreases as the static strain level is increased. The static strain level at a cable support includes three major components: Tension, radial compression; and bending.

AB - Six fatigue tests of prestressed concrete I-beams containing web reinforcement are reported. Each beam was initially subjected to a high overload, and then subjected to 2,000,000 cycles of a design equivalent repeated loading. The beams failed by either flexural or shear fatigue. The flexural fatigue life of the test beams was less than expected from available information on the fatigue strength of strand. The tests demonstrated that prestressed concrete beams have a remarkable shear fatigue resistance. Prestressed beams, with enough web reinforcement to develop their flexural capacity, can be subjected to overloads which cause extensive cracking without subsequent danger of a shear fatigue failure under design loads. Shear fatigue failures do not occur suddenly. There is considerable warning, as indicated by increasing deflection and increasing inclined crack width, before failure occurs. In these and other tests, shear fatigue failures did not occur when the range in inclined crack width was less than 0.006 in. under application of repeated loads.

AB - Computer-aided procedures have been developed to allow architects and engineers with no previous computer experience to predict the theoretical fire rating of different layers of fireproofing materials. The device which permits such a theoretical evaluation is a problem-oriented computer language known as FIRE (Fire Intensity-Resistance Evaluation). Using the procedure in the language the engineer can choose up to three different layers of material to be evaluated under various fire intensities. The layers which can contain water or different transformation products can be considered to be in intimate contact or separated by an air gap. The various layers can also be attached to a heat sink which represents the mass of various structural members of different sizes. A directory of 50 materials is available for evaluation under fire exposures of different intensities and durations. Correlations are now being carried with existing fire tests to insure the best fit for the different material parameters required.
