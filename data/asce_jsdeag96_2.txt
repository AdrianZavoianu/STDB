AB - Two methods are described in which the response of plane, framed structures to load can be assessed by accounting for superstructure and substructure as a single compatible unit. Both methods are based on the assumption of linear-elastic behavior in superstructure and raft. The Winkler model is used to represent the behavior of the soil beneath the raft. The first method uses equilibrium equations to describe separately the response of structure and raft. Sufficient relationships to solve the complete problem are obtained by adding the compatibility relationships at the junction of raft and superstructure. In the second method, statically admissible contact pressure distributions beneath the raft are successively modified to converge upon the situation where the deformations at the junction of raft and structure are compatible. Both methods are designed for hand calculations.

AB - Construction of nuclear containment structures utilizing standard reinforcing steel was satisfactorily performed in 1964 when plant capacities were small and the design restrictions moderate. Since that time the output of plants has increased enormously and the design restrictions have multiplied to keep pace with protective measures against the possibility of accidents. Unexpected requirements have been inserted in the design criteria to guard against any damages from earthquakes or tornadoes, even in areas not normally considered subject to such forces. Special means of splicing reinforcing bars have been developed. That, coupled with chemical make-up, produces stronger as well as more ductile bars with resultant higher allowable yield stresses. Proof of the design has been substantiated by actual pressure tests on a full scale containment before operation. The results proved that the accuracy of the design and calculations was satisfactory. The width of cracks was within the range expected and all closed when the pressure was removed. No damage was incurred by the liner, and continued use of conventional reinforcing bars for containment construction appears to be satisfactory.

AB - Safety is described in terms of reliability or probability of survival for multimember multiload condition structures with loads and strengths as random variables. These include weakest link structures which fail if any member fails and fail-safe structures which survive even after the failure or yielding of some members. A proposed design method is to proportion member sizes with a mathematical programming approach to minimize weight subject to an overall probability of failure constraint. Examples presented include trusses designed by weakest link failure analysis and limit designed redundant or fail safe rigid frames. A sequence of numerical integrations evaluates the failure probability for any form of load and strength frequency distribution. Results show the optimum design versus allowable failure probability, coefficients of variation and frequency distribution for load and strength and the effect of failure mode correlation which is due to different members being affected by the same loading.

AB - An analytical study of the elastic buckling behavior of the flanges of horizontally curved I-shaped girders is presented. The prebuckling flange stresses in the longitudinal and radial directions due to bending and nonuniform torsion are determined using an elasticity approach. The magnitudes of these stresses are compared with those resulting from a strength of materials approach. Using these stresses and the finite difference method, buckling coefficients, k, are obtained by treating the flanges of the girder as elastically restrained curved plates. The influence of curvature and the ratio of bending stress to warping normal stress on these buckling coefficients is evaluated. The buckling coefficients are compared with those for rectangular plates. Width to thickness requirements based on preventing local buckling in the elastic range are also obtained.

AB - A set of three partial difference equations is derived which describes exactly the in-plane free vibrational motion of the joints of a regular, orthogonal, two-dimensional framework having rigid joint connections. The equations include concentrated masses and inertias at the joints. Two cases are treated in detail; one in which the joints have rotational freedom and one in which rotation and horizontal displacement are permitted. For specific boundary conditions, transcendental equations for the free vibration frequencies and solutions for the modal functions are obtained in the form of discrete trigonometric functions. A method is outlined for finding solutions to the frame having three degrees-of-freedom at all interior joints but with highly specialized conditions along the vertical boundaries. For comparison, the governing difference equations for two lumped parameter models are obtained as special cases of the general equations. Numerical results for specific frames illustrate typical frequency spectra and indicate application of the results to evaluating the accuracy of approximate models.

AB - The concept of prestressing is used to eliminate local buckling in tubular columns. When the prestress is introduced by a pressurized gas, the lightest columns yet proposed for low structural indices are obtained. The weight of such members is found to be proportional to their load and length, and independent of the modulus of elasticity. The former property makes it possible, for the first time, to design realistic Michell structures. A second method of prestressing utilizes the centrifugal forces developed by circulating fluids. First order considerations indicate that the fluid columns approach zero weight as the fluid speed becomes unbounded.

AB - An index for the selection of a candidate structural material under thermal shock conditions is formulated. By an engineering approximation, the index is derived from a set of parameters which governs the solutions in thermoelasticity. In the modes of heat transfer, only the heat conduction and radiation are considered. The influence of temperature dependence of these indices is stressed. To avoid any possible misconception on the selection of the index, it is recommended that an examination of the total temperature range of interest be made. An example of a heated sphere is used to illustrate the analysis, and the derived index agrees well with the previous result.

AB - The object of the present paper is to provide a more complete three-dimensional continuous method for structures comprising simple or coupled, prismatic or nonprismatic, shear walls and frames arranged asymmetrically in the floor plane. The unknowns of the problem are three continuous functions of horizontal displacements; two for the translations parallel to the structure axes, and one for the angle of twist. These functions are derived from a system of three third-degree nonhomogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients. The homogeneous part of the solution relates to an eigenvalue problem of a third-degree matrix, involving nine arbitrary constants obtainable from the boundary conditions. The particular solution depends on the type of loading; a uniform lateral load yields a second-order polynomial and a trapezoidal load yields a third-order one. With the three functions known the three displacement functions for each of the stiffening elements and elastic media can be calculated and the internal forces established. The present method is applicable to structures with nonuniform geometric properties by dividing them into uniform zones, solving for each zone separately, and determining the relevant constants from interzone boundary conditions.

AB - A computer program was developed to predict the strength of hollow rectangular tubular columns with ends pinned and free to rotate in any direction for various load eccentricities with respect to the strong axis. A key assumption in the theory used is that the rectangular section had enough torsional stiffness to make any twisting of the column negligible. This assumption and the theory in general were verified by testing eight 4-in. by 2-in. by 0.1875 in columns of A36 steel. It was concluded that the load reduction at the theoretical intersection length increases for smaller values of the ratio of weak to strong axis radius of gyration and for increasing values of the ratio of weak-to-strong axis radius of gyration and for increasing values of load eccentricity. The maximum reduction for a member with width-to-depth ratio 0.40 is about 9% when the load is applied to the edge of the member. The failure of unbraced column with bending about the strong axis will occur by lateral buckling except, possibly, in the case of very short members.

AB - The case history of stability problems and failure for a spaced-member timber bridge truss is presented together with the cause of failure and the corrective measures. The cause of failure is identified as differential longitudinal movement between the two timbers of the spaced-member upper chord. Bolted joints permit differential longitudinal movement. This causes joint displacement and stability problems. The differential movement must be eliminated to achieve stable conditions. The new information on stress transfer gained from this experience applies to the general case of a wood truss with spaced-members.

AB - The torsional stiffness of reinforced concrete beams drops drastically when diagonal cracking occurs, to 1/10 or 1/30 of the initial stiffness. Elexural stiffness drops only to 1/2 or 1/3 when flexural cracking occurs. Thus the elastic analysis appropriate at small loads cannot be projected to the ultimate or collapse state. The strength of web reinforcement is not fully developed until the rotation angle is 10 to 15 times that first causing diagonal cracking. Such large twist angles are not usable, even at an ultimate condition. A stiffness limit rather than a strength limit probably controls the proper use of web reinforcement. Longitudinal reinforcement for torsion carries stresses dependent more on twist angle than on the magnitude of torque. With properly limited twist angles (at ultimate) the extra longitudinal reinforcement for torsion can be reduced below that now recommended.

AB - Dynamic responses of a free-standing latticed floodlight tower are determined for time-varying wind forces derived from available wind data and also from simulated wind records. The structure is represented by an idealized lumped-mass system in the analysis. All computations were performed on a digital computer. The computed results compared fairly well with observed responses; these results also showed that, for all practical purposes, effects of modes higher than the second mode may be neglected in the analysis. The wind data simulation procedure permits the following to be included: (1) power-law velocity profile; (2) random fluctuations of velocity and yaw; (3) constant or time-varying mean velocity patterns; and (4) gusts. Data simulated in this manner may be used for dynamic analysis.

AB - The finite deflection theory analysis of a spatial system of nets on the basis of nonlinear theory and a more accurate representation of the material's stress-strain relationship is presented. The structures considered comprise cables and truss members which are assumed incapable of resisting bending. The theory is valid regardless of the magnitude of the displacements as long as the stresses are within the elastic limits. An actual stress-strain curve is used for members stressed beyond the proportional limit. A derivation is given for the tangent stiffnes matrix of a space structure at a state of deformation. The joint equations of equilibrium are transformed into linear equations at any intermediate state of deformation, and a solution tangent to the load-deflection curve is obtained. The displacements are determined by means of an iterative technique. The analysis is given for three problems: (1) Cable; (2) prestressd suspension roof; and (3) truss stressed beyond the proportional limit.
