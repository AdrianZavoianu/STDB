AB - This summary of British research on composite beams covers the period 1960 to 1968, during which emphasis was placed on the behavior of uncased beams at ultimate load (for buildings) and under repeated load (for bridges). The publications of the Drafting Committee for the British Code of Practice for Composite Construction are reviewed and related to the AISC and AASHO specifications. A more detailed account is given of the research at the University of Cambridge on uncased and concrete-encased beams. It is concluded that sufficient work has been completed to enable an ultimate-strength design method for continuous floor structures for buildings to be codified for composite construction in uncased mild steel and normal-density concrete. Further research is required on the composite behavior of lightweight concrete, high-yield steel and metal-deck flooring.

AB - A numerical procedure based upon power series approach is presented for studying the elastic behavior of biaxially loaded columns with eccentricities not alike at the two ends. The equal eccentricity case is treated as a special case in the generalized procedure developed in this study. The numerical results for deflections, twist and initial yield load obtained by this method are compared with some of the existing analytical as well as experimental results. The agreement with the analytical solutions is found to be excellent. The study indicates the possibility of extending this approach to the inelastic case.

AB - The results of tests on single-panel square reinforced concrete flat plate structures supported on four corner columns are presented. The study aims at an investigation of the behavior and strength of the column-slab connection in the presence of axial load and biaxial bending. The distribution of the bending moments across the width of the slabs as well as the load-deflection behavior of the slabs up to collapse were observed and analyzed. The results indicate that existing methods for predicting the strength of column-slab connections of interior columns, when extended to corner columns, will produce extremely conservative results.

AB - An analysis is made of creep and shrinkage effects in a cracked rectangular concrete section containing both tension and compression reinforcement and subjected to a constant sustained moment. Results are checked for accuracy against published test data. Calculations of long-term beam behavior show an extreme redistribution of internal stresses in the section. In some not unusual cases it is shown that tensile stresses can appear in the upper compressive fibers of the concrete. The analysis provides a means for investigating long-term deflections in reinforced concrete beams.

AB - A procedure is presented for the dynamic analysis of three-dimensional multistory buildings subjected to multiple stochastic wind forces. Multivariate normal probability density functions are defined for normal mode displacements, rigid body floor displacements, and member end-displacements and forces. The wind force quadrature-spectral density is magnified several times more than its co-factor spectral density by the receptance coefficients. The integral constants are proportional to the area under the receptance coefficient curves. The calculated value of the wind force cross-spectral density function must be as accurate as posible between the building's natural frequencies of vibration.

AB - A general matrix formulation suitable for a use of the digital computer is presented for dynamic analysis of frameworks composed of prismatic members. The dynamic stiffness coefficients are derived in the form of nondimensional parameters corresponding to the effects of rotatory inertia, shear deformation, and of bending deformation. The individual parameter may be dropped when the appropriate effect is not considered; hence, the stiffness coefficients can be applied to a problem with various considerations of Timoshenko theory, Rayleigh theory, bending and shear, and of Bernoulli-Euler theory. Input data for the computer include the configurations of the framework and the elastic properties of constituent members. The method may be applied to irregular frameworks composed of sloping members with and without sidesway. Numerical examples presented indicate that the effect of rotatory inertia and of shear deformation on the frequencies of frameworks without sidesway is more significant than that of swayed structures.

AB - Tests to study strength and deformation behavior in the inelastic range provide an experimental verification of a new procedure that was developed for designing columns in braced multistory frames. Two types of subassemblages were included: subassemblages with columns bent in single curvature and subassemblages with columns bent in double curvature. For each type of subassemblage, two tests were performed, the difference being the slenderness ratio (about the major axis), which was chosen to be 35 in one test and 30 in the other. The axial load in the columns varied from about 75% to 85% of the axial yield load. The test subassemblages were designed as if they were part of an actual building frame. The beams were proportioned for their plastic mechanism strength, and the columns were so selected that they had just enough capacity to resist the maximum moment transmitted from the beams. The results show that the load carrying capacity of subassemblages can be closely predicted by the theory upon which the design procedure is based.

AB - A nonlinear creep analysis for reinforced concrete beams is formulated by means of the ordinary flexure theory. The analysis is based on the assumptions that data from sustained load cylinder tests may be used to represent the stress-strain-time relation for the concrete and that this relation is unique, that is, independent of prior stress history. The stress-strain-time relation so obtained, and certain geometry conditions from the plane section hypothesis, are introduced into the beam equilibrium equations to give a set of simultaneous differential equations that govern the beam deformations. A numerical procedure for solving these equations is proposed and results are compared to measurements from laboratory tests. It is concluded that the theory is suitable for predicting creep deformations in beams under high sustained loads, but its application to the case of shrinkage in an unloaded beam or to the case of repeated loading is questionable. However, the proposed analysis may provide an important means for studying flexural strength characteristics of concrete beams under sustained loads.

AB - Heavier box sections with thicker walls without the need of longitudinal stiffeners are widely used to resist combined torsion and bending loads in machines such as earth-moving and mining equipment. To solve for the torsion stresses and the angle of twist for such boomless boxes, a part of the area of the wall cross section is assumed to be concentrated at the corners and to be equivalent stiffeners. The transformed box is then solved by the customary procedures. A new method of solving for the stresses and angles of twist in a heavy walled box is given. It is based upon the fact that the longitudinal and shearing streses associated with restraining a cross section from warping when pure torque is applied, consist of two separate but related self-equilibrating systems that are distributed throughout the walls. Both systems are completely determined, and these two systems are superposed on the St-Venant (Bredt-Batho) System that is based upon complete freedom of every cross section to warp.

AB - Three full-size precast concrete gabled frames were tested to destruction. These frames were instrumented and tested to determine the amount of moment redistribution that occurred at high overload. Each frame was 40-ft wide and 18-ft high. High strength reinforcement was used. An increase in capacity of about 30% beyond the computed yield load was measured. Capacities implied by three well-known limit design procedures were compared with test loads. In addition, test loads were compared with those predicted by an analysis based on actual material properties, compatibility of deformations and equilibrium of forces. These comparisons indicate that several limit design procedures provide a satisfactory prediction of load capacity of the test frames.

AB - The method uses the substructure transformation inherent in the Choleski decomposition and involves a partial release of the interior coordinates. A comparison is made between the decomposition method and the standard one which requires the full release of all interior degrees-of-freedom before the boundary problem is solved. It is concluded that the decomposition method requires less numerical calculations and manipulates less data than the standard method. In addition, the numerical calculations for the substructure decomposition method can be performed within the context of the Choleski decomposition method and requires few new computer routines.

AB - The results of several investigations into the extension of plastic design theory to include continuous composite steel-concrete beams are applicable only to beams subjected to gravity loads. They are not generally applicable to continuous composite beams in unbraced multi-story frames where the frames are subjected to combined gravity and lateral wind loads. A pilot investigation was conducted at Lehigh University to explore the ultimate strength behavior of unbraced frames with steel columns and composite steel-concrete beams under combined load conditions. Two full-size joint assemblies were constructed and loaded to simulate the combined load conditions at the exterior and interior joints. The results of this investigation indicated that plastic design methods which have been developed for unbraced frames could be extended to include unbraced frames with continuous composite beams.

AB - This investigation covers the effect of two-way action on crack width development in both centrally loaded and uniformly loaded slab systems of varied boundary conditions. As a result, criterion is developed whereby more but narrower flexural cracks of orthogonal pattern can be precipitated, thereby control of crack width development in two-way concrete floor slabs. A cracking hypothesis is presented and verified by tests on 22 centrally loaded slabs 5 ft 8 in. x 5 ft 8 in., and 32 uniformly loaded slabs 5 ft 0 in. x 5 ft 0 in. The size and spacing of the wire reinforcement are varied to extremes. A grid index is proposed as a measure of crack control in two-way slabs under different boundary as well as loading conditions.

AB - The advantages of lower bound solutions to the collapse loads of slabs are well known. However, lower bound solutions are available for only few cases. The chief difficulty in obtaining a best lower bound solution arises from the fact that the maximum possible value for the collapse load has to be determined such that both equilibrium equation and yield condition are satisfied at all points in the slab. This note presents the development of a simplified approach.

AB - This note presents the solution to the problem of the absolute minimum volume of reinforcement for strength criterion. It is for the case of clamped square reinforced concrete slabs, using Hillerborg's strip method and the necessary and sufficient conditions for an absolute minimum to exist as proposed by Rozvany and Charret based on the Prager and Shield hypothesis, for uncurtailed and curtailed reinforcement layouts.
