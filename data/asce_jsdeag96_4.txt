AB - An approximate method of predicting the post-elastic behavior of clamped, uniformly loaded, rectangular mild-steel plates is presented. The solution is based on the assumption that an initially deflected stress-free plate has the same load-deflection properties as a plate which has had a permanent set equal in magnitude to the initial deflection induced by loading beyond the elastic limit. Solutions for the initially deflected plate obtained by Nylander's method are used to develop the post-elastic solutions which are presented in graphical form suitable for design purposes. Comparisons with existing theories and experimental data show that the method accurately predicts the post-elastic deflections of long plates and that as the plate approaches a square in shape the deflections are increasingly overestimated.

AB - Engineering design problems may include the need to estimate whether an observed or suspected crack or crack-like flaw in a metallic structure will extend slowly enough during service operations that structural integrity will not be compromised before repairs or replacement can be conveniently scheduled. This aspect of sub-critical cracking in metal structures can be usefully treated with methods derived from linear elastic fracture mechanics. With these available formulations, the experimental bases for estimating Model I sub-critical fatigue cracking are reviewed. The effects of differing material characteristics, loading variables, and environmental factors are analyzed. Within this framework, estimated solutions for three example problems of increasing complexity are demonstrated.

AB - As a result of the Ohio River Bridge failure at Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1967, periodic inspections of bridges are requested by the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads. The importance of bridge deck inspection and maintenance was emphasized in a 1964 Highway Research Board Report. The key to extended life of bridge decks, and sometimes to the safety of the entire bridge structure, is found in maintaining the water-tight integrity of the deck. Periodic inspections should logically lead to timely preventive maintenance practices. The history of the Los Alamos Canyon Bridge at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and the continuing investigation of protection materials is used as a typical example of bridge deck inspection and maintenance practices. Protection methods are divided into two categories: (1) Protective coatings for water proofing the original bridge deck surface; and (2) protective coverings which provide a new wearing surface as well as sealing and waterproofing the deck.

AB - Prestress loss and camber of prestressed concrete beams were found to grow with time at a decreasing rate provided no dead or live load was applied to relieve the beam from the eccentric prestressing force. Nineteen full-size bridge beams made of normal weight and lightweight concrete were studied. Simple hyperbolic functions to predict the time-dependent prestress loss and camber were developed. Predicted results by this method and the rate of creep method were compared with measured values. Comparisons between predicted and measured results of tests reported by others were also made. It was found that: (1) the prestress loss and camber of the bridge beams, stored in the open air in Houston, Texas, attained their ultimate values within 100 days to 150 days after prestressing, and ; (2) predicted values by both methods were in close overall agreement with measured values.

AB - Recent developments in optimal design procedures now make it possible to optimize large numbers of design objectives. The basis of this procedure is a generalized, multivariable optimization criteria that essentially attempts to compromise design objectives and is capable of handling any additional inequality constraints. Variations of the procedure depend only on the imagination and resourcefulness of the designer. The current program specifically designs a three-layered composite sandwich by selecting the materials from a data bank of discrete material properties. The final design represents a compromise between maximum bending stiffness, i.e., an index of bucking resistance, and moment capacity, minimum cost and weight, a number of inequality constraints involving streses and deflections, heat transmission and resonant sound frequencies. The importance of each design objective is determined by the designer in setting up the so-called ranking matrix. Alternate designs can be quickly evaluated for changes in ranking values, constraints, design loads, material properties, etc.
