AB - The results of tests on 18 rectangular reinforced concrete beams subjected to combined bending torsion and shear are reported. The principal variables were the ratio of twisting to bending moment, the transverse shear force, and the reinforcement configuration. The beams failed by one of three different modes which were characterized by the formation of a hinge adjacent to one face of the beam and yielding of the reinforcement adjacent to the face opposite to the hinge. In beams subjected to a constant twisting moment and a varying bending moment, failures with the hinge located adjacent to the bottom face occurred in the region subjected to the lowest bending moment and failures with the hinge located adjacent to the top face occurred in the region of highest bending moment. Idealized failure surfaces are defined and expressions for the strength of these beams are derived using an equilibrium approach. The results are presented both in tabular form and in interaction diagrams. Good correlation is obtained between the predicted and observed mode of failure and strength.

AB - The elastic and inelastic deformation behavior and the ultimate load capacities of suspension roof structures is presented. The equations for the forces and displacements of cable networks resulting from changes in loading have inherent mathematical difficulties which are investigated and physically explained. Specific existing solution techniques are modified and proposed for use in order to improve the convergence for solutions of any type of cable network with any type of applied loading. Examples of highly nonlinear cable networks with symmetrical and unsymmetrical loading are calculated for illustration. Using an accelerated convergence technique, the nonlinear behavior of cable networks resulting from a combination of large displacements and of inelastic material behavior is investigated. Four orthogonal networks of both positive and negative Gaussian curvature are examined and compared. The large reserve carrying capacities inherent in cable networks is indicated. The important parameters which influence the ultimate load capacities are discussed.

AB - A general matrix-network procedure is formulated for tracing the load-deflection characteristics of frameworks loaded through the elastic range and inelastically to the plastic collapse stage. An iterative incremental analysis procedure is employed, with the load-displacement characteristics of the structure piecewise linearized over finite loading increments. Consecutive nonproportional loading systems comprised of any arrangement of concentrated member and joint loads are considered. The classical plastic hinge concept is extended to incorporate the interaction of flexural and torsional moments and axial force. The force and plastic deformation increment vectors at each plastic hinge are constrained to remain perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to the yield surface normal vector during finite loading increments. A procedure is developed for periodically drawing the force vector at any plastic hinge an arbitrarily specified distance back from the yield surface tangent plane, while maintaining equilibrium and compatibility in the structure. The analysis procedure incorporates provision for distinguishing between partial and total collapse mechanisms.

AB - A comprehensive procedure is presented for design of cylindrical concrete water tanks based on the theory of beams on elastic foundations. Temperature stresses are given careful consideration including variation of temperature through the tank wall. Analysis shows that there is considerable variation of temperature stresses over the tank. Hydrostatic and earthquake forces are also covered. Wind stresses that relate to tanks with varying height to diameter ratios are analyzed and design procedures are given. Charts are provided to facilitate solutions by desk calculator; these cover temperature stresses and varying types of end restraints to tank walls. Sample design calculations for a storage tank on spread footing are included.
