AB - Test results on reinforced concrete L-beams with closed stirrups under combined torsion, shear, and flexure are reported. Emphasis is placed on beams having less longitudinal steel than required to develop the full potential shear strength of the beams, that is, beams which in the absence of torsion would fail in flexure. Based on test data an interaction surface is defined for L-beams with symmetrical top and bottom steel which checks test results closely. Stiffness in torsion before and after diagonal cracking is examined. The large drop in stiffness after initial diagonal cracking under combined loadings is examined. Measurements of strain show additional stresses in longitudinal bars resulting from torsion, but stresses of significance only after diagonal cracking. The total demand for longitudinal steel is perhaps not as great as the sum of that required for moment and torsion calculated separately.

The loading program was designed to simulate the effects of a one-and two-point heavy load moving slowly across the beam. The experiments were performed on 1.5 in. by 0.75 in. rectangular, heat-treated, steel bars and on as-rolled, wide-flange, two-span steel beams. The test results are examined in accordance with a shakedown analysis based on the simple plastic theory. Design implications with special reference to bridges are also considered.

AB - To obtain information on the heat curving process for the fabrication of horizontally curved highway bridges, an analytical and experimental investigation was conducted to determine the residual stresses, strains, and curvature in a typical heat-curved girder. The analytical results were reported separately. The 52-ft-long test girder was a typical welded, A36 steel, plate girder. Residual stresses before heat curving were determined by sectioning. The remaining 46-ft-long girder was curved to a radius of 397 ft in six successive runs by using a continuous heat-curving process. Strains and temperatures were recorded during each run, and the residual stress, strain, and curvature after each run were determined. The behavior of the girder was in agreement with the analytical investigation. When compared with the experimental values, the analytical solution satisfactorily predicted the residual stresses but under-estimated the residual curvature.

AB - Analysis of shrinkage stress in concrete beam and some laboratory tests to verify this analysis were carried out. Deformation due to drying shrinkage and thermal cycles was measured in the field on model and full-sized concrete pavements (with and without expansive components) to obtain the distribution of shrinkage strain, the restraint by subgrade, the combined strain due to drying shrinkage and thermal cycles and the effects of use of expansive concrete on shrinkage stresses. Shrinkage stress in concrete pavements was evaluated by these observations and supplemental laboratory tests. The result shows that shrinkage stresses in concrete pavements due to drying shrinkage are by no means small, especially warping shrinkage stresses due to restraint of curvature of pavements should be considered in the design of concrete pavements.

AB - A theoretical means of computing the deflections of beams subjected to variable repeated loading is discussed. The method of analysis includes strain hardening, changes in the virgin moment-curvature curve due to the cyclic nature of the load, and allows yielding to occur over a finite region of the beam. The results of the analysis are compared to test results. The method predicts shakedown loads beyond the simple plastic load and accurately predicts deflection response.

AB - Theoretical analysis is presented of the elastic behavior of both the laced and battened structural member considering the effects of axial load, shear deformation, and connection rigidity of subelements. The analytical solution is used to obtain modified slope-deflection equations to generalize a relation between applied forces and joint displacements. A nondimensional parameter, the shear flexibility, is defined so as to characterize the shear flexibility of the members and to take account of the effects of axial force, local joint connections, and local connection flexibility of the battened members. The fundamental linear second-order differential equation for the deflection curve of the member which includes the effect of shear deformation has been derived. Using boundary conditions for the general solution of deflected shape of the member, the solutions are set up in the forms of slope-deflection equations. Elastic buckling loads for the structural members have been evaluated for various boundary conditions.

AB - Methods for the analysis of shear lag in wide flanges are reviewed and a treatment is presented which incorporates the effect of the web upon the stress distribution in the stiffened flange of a box girder by replacing the web with an edge stiffener on the flange. Attention is drawn to the effect of severe shear lag on the curvature and displaced shape of a cantilevered box girder. A series of tests on model girders is described and the results are compared with an approximate stiffener-sheet analysis, a more rigorous orthotropic plate analysis, and a plane stress finite element analysis; the latter is used to analyze flanges under more complex conditions. A three-dimensional finite element analysis confirmed the observed curvatures at the section of high shear lag.

AB - Horizontally curved steel girders for curved highway bridges can be economically fabricated by building a straight girder and then heating appropriate flange edges to induce a residual curvature after cooling. The results of a theoretical investigation of the residual stress, strain, and curvature due to this heat-curving process are presented. The analytical model used a perfect elastic-plastic, temperature-dependent stress-strain relationship for the steel, and temperature profiles in the girder flanges based on heat-transfer theory for a semi-infinite plate. The effects of maximum edge temperatures to 1,150°F over increasing widths of the flanges of a typical girder were determined. The residual stresses after heat curving were tensile near the flange edge and compressive elsewhere, except near the center of the flange, where tensile stress sometimes remained. The final curvature, which was determined from the residual strain distribution, generally increased with maximum temperature.

AB - Tests on six rectangular beams reinforced with variable amounts of deformed steel bars and precast prestressed concrete prisms are reported. Methods are suggested for computing the moment causing cracking of the in situ concrete and that causing cracking of the prestressed reinforcement. After cracking of prestressed reinforcement, and up to commencement of yield of nonprestressed tension reinforcement, flexural analysis could be done using same assumptions of classic working stress design by associating to the combined area of strand and deformed bars a Pseudo Modulus of Elasticity Eps higher than that of ordinary steel Es. During that stage it was found that for similar beams with equal total areas of tension reinforcement, the ratio between their maximum crack widths was practically equal to the inverse of their respective Pseudo Moduli. Strain hardening effects should be taken into consideration in estimating ultimate moment capacity of beams reinforced with such composite reinforcement.

AB - Compact and inexpensive seismographs and tiltmeters have been developed during this project to measure the large displacement, low frequency oscillations of tall buildings due to wind. They were used to record the motion and tilt of a 55-story concrete frame building in Chicago for a period of 30 days. Simultaneous recordings were made of (1) displacement in orthogonal horizontal directions at diagonal corners of the top floor; (2) tilt in two orthogonal directions at diagonal corners of the top floor, the center of the 42nd floor, and the center of the 3rd floor; and (3) wind direction and velocity above top of building. At a recorded wind velocity of 70 mph it was found that the top of the building leans over 1.5 in. and oscillates through a peak-to-peak displacement of 1.0 in. with a fundamental period of 4.0 sec. Fundamental and third mode vibrations were observed.

AB - Forty-eight concrete prisms of square section were studied under monotonically increased axial compression up to maximum load. The two variables in the study concerned the provision of transverse reinforcement in the form of closed square hoops. One variable was the spacing of hoops and the other was the area of cross section of the hoop. Center-to-center spacings varied between 3/4 in. and 6 in., and three areas of hoop cross section were considered. Results clearly showed that the increase in strength, over that for plain concrete, was proportional to the cross-section area of the hoop and to the reciprocal of the hoop spacing. The axial contraction at the maximum load appeared to be similarly related to those two parameters. A semi-empirical equation for the strength of concrete confined by rectangular hoops proposed by Blume, Newmark and Corning was shown to predict the strength of the speicmens with satisfactory accuracy.

AB - Spandrel beams and drop panels, or both, often existed in monolithic continuous structures. The analysis of this type of structural member is entirely different from that of a member having a uniform section. An optimum design method for a prestressed concrete member with prismatic haunches under a uniformly distributed load is developed without calculating the secondary moment caused by the prestressing force. This reduces the analysis to that of a nonprestressed member and gives a direct design procedure and desired stresses in the control section of the member for practical application.

AB - A method for analyzing light gage cold-formed steel beams with buckled flanges in situations when the bending moment changes sign is described. If the bending moment changes sign, the standard procedure using the same effective width for each buckled flange over the whole length of the beam breaks down. Instead, separate effective widths are established for the compression flanges of each part of the beam with a bending moment of the same sign. The points of zero bending moment are not known a priori and their determination is part of the solution. The governing equations are highly nonlinear and have to be solved by a numerical process of successive approximations. The approximations were found to converge very rapidly.

AB - Nuclear power plants and required containments are to be so designed and constructed that the release of radioactive material in the unlikely event of a reactor accident can be controlled, and the health and safety of the public can be insured. As a result of the higher standard of safety demanded of them adn of hte lack of precedence in these particular applications, many problems arise in the design and construction of such structures. Containments are designed basically for an acccident condition which involves comparatively high pressure and temperature. The design must also take into consideration earthquakes of high intensity, tornadoes and missiles generated by tornadoes, aircraft crashes, and other caues. Design is complicated by the presence of large penetrations. There is no established code or specification for such structures. Quality assurance from design to construction is highly emphasized. To ensure its integrity, the containment is to be tested both for its structural soundness and leak-tightness after completion of the construction.
