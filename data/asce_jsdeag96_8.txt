AB - Laboratory tests to evaluate the bond between freshly overlaid concrete on an existing concrete surface were studied. Cement grout and epoxy were used separately as bonding agents on two parallel series of tests with preparation of existing surface as a variable. Static and repeated loadings were applied on freshly overlaid precracked concrete beams. The contribution of the bonded concrete overlay to the flexural rigidity of the beam at various stages of loading were determined. It was concluded that concrete overlays can be made to bond to existing concrete surfaces using cement grout or epoxy as bonding agents, and that repeated loadings within the working range will not cause bond failure between the two concretes. Thin bonded concrete overlays were found to increase considerably the flexural rigidity and the ultimate moment capacity of the existing concrete section.

AB - Frame stability calculations are recast into the form of a low order, nonlinear eigenvlaue problem. It is shown that at each stage of the iterative solution of the problem, upper and lower bounds on the sway buckling load are established. The conditions needed for convergence and bounding are examined and verified by several numerical problems. It is shown that under usual conditions bounding and convergence are obtained for any reasonable starting assumption of load factor. For unusual cases, the use of submembers is interpreted to be a means of avoiding numerical difficulties.

AB - The Fourier Series slope-deflection method has been developed as a means of analyzing curved orthotropic deck bridge systems. Bridge deflections and internal forces in the curved girders are determined at any location on the span. The method allows for the interaction of the curved orthotropic or isotropic plates with curved elastic girders. All deflections, slopes, and internal forces are assumed as a Fourier Series and are thus determined by a term-by-term solution. Equilibrium equations are developed at all girder-plate junctions as they are at member joints in the rigid frame slope-deflection method. The entire slope-deflection analysis has been programmed for use on an IBM 7094 computer. This program is applied to an existing straight beam and a number of hypothetical curved beam spans. The effects of slab thickness, warping and pure torsional stiffness, and radius of curvature are presented for a hypothetical curved bridge system.

AB - Stress-strain relationships developed for concrete subjected to concentric compressive loadings are used to predict the response of concrete subjected to eccentric loadings. The computed response is compared with the results of 19 test specimens subjected to strain gradients in which the strain at one face of the specimen was held at zero and the strain at the other face was varied. The results indicate that under monotonic loading to failure, the stress strain curve for concrete subjected to strain gradients is essentially the same as for concrete subjected to uniform strains. The response of concrete under repeated eccentric loading is reliably predicted using the stress-strain relations developed for concrete under repeated concentric loading.

AB - The problem of minimum weight design of structures composed of finite elements each having a finite number of degrees of freedom and subject to a critical buckling load constraint is formulated as in nonlinear programming. Employing the accelerated cutting plane method of Wolfe, all constraints except the general buckling load constraint are expressed by linear inequalities. A method for the solution of this problem is developed which differs from the projected gradient method only in the way the direction of motion is selected once the nonlinear constraint is encountered. The method involves first moving in the direction of the projected gradient, and then returning to this region on the hyperplane of constant weight along the projection of the buckling-constraint gradient. The method is applied to the minimum weight design of a built-up column of varying width.

AB - The method assumes the arch dam to be divided into two systems of elements, arches and cantilevers, which are formed by voussoirs. In the voussoirs at the crossing of arches and cantilevers all the internal forces and external loads are considered and the complete set of equations of equilibrium is established. Also considered are the three components of linear displacements and the six rotations of the normals to the faces. For reasons of continuity and of equilibrium of shear stresses, it is shown that the torsions of the horizontal and vertical axes are not independent and that the vertical and tangential displacements must be taken simultaneously. The internal forces are obtained by solving a system of equations of compatibility which express equal displacements at the crossing of arches and cantilevers. Both systems of elements are analyzed for triangular unit loads, for which the coefficient of influence of the various displacements are determined. The method presents a matrix formulation for the arches and a general formula for the cantilevers.

AB - The developments are described of local flexibility and stiffness matrices of straight-tapered members, circular members of constant cross section, and prismatic beams on Winkler-Type elastic foundations and their corresponding fixed end force vectors for concentrated and linearly distributed loads and moments including effects of axial and shear deformations. The developments herein are intended for the general applications to space frame structures. The procedure for the reduction of matrices to suit other types of structures such as plane frames, grids, etc., can be found in standard textbooks and thus will not be repeated. The formulations of matrices and vectors given are readily programmed and may be implemented directly into a general structural analysis program. Also, the developed equations can be used to analyze arches, curved girders, railroad tracks and other machine parts in a small computer.

AB - A general theory of torsion of tapered box girders of deformable cross section, its experimental substantiation, studies of the ultimate strength of box girders, and the use of the theory derived for analysis of a really big bridge, are presented. Warping stresses and distortion stresses from transverse flexure are computed. A simple criterion is derived for load distribution on the bridge to ensure the greatest effects of bending and torsion. It is possible to use computers for practical computations; the presented solution is simplified and expressed in the form of formulas for less important cases. The analysis is applicable to straight tapered box girders of deformable cross section, and also for continuity over intermediate supports, and arbitrary end support conditions. It is also applicable to girders with rigid cross section.

AB - The method presented herein, being a development of Moment Distribution by Successive Over-Relaxation, can only be applied to symmetrical single bay frames. Such frames may be comparatively rare but their study is worthwhile because many regular multibay frames subjected to a loading of a regular pattern can be reduced to equivalent symmetrical single bay frames.
