AB - Many structures in the 20-story to 40-story range consist of a number of bents tied together by diaphragms at each floor level. Each bent may consist of a rigid frame or of rigid frames coupled to one or more shear walls. The shear walls have relatively large flexural stiffnesses and tend to dominate the action of the building. A plastic design procedure is presented for such structures. The procedure accounts for the wallframe interaction forces, the inelastic behavior of both wall and frame elements and the secondary forces due to the gravity loads acting on the deformed structure. The procedure utilizes the sway subassemblage technique to determine the resistance of the structural steel rigid frames in their deformed positions. An example is presented.

AB - The ultimate capacity of columns subjected to biaxial loading can be predicted by the plastic theory's intersecting shape criterion of failure. Twenty-nine failure predictions, based on this criterion, were verified by small scale experiments with good results. The criterion gave failure predictions which are some 30% higher than those provided by theories related to the attainment of yielding in the column. Because of this indication of savings of material the theoretical and experimental work of this paper may prove to be of significance in the evolution of a new design approach for biaxially loaded hollow box steel columns. The paper describes the theory of intersecting shapes; records a wide range of failure predictions which were calculated using this theory; favorably compares 29 of these predictions with small scale experiments; and indicates that savings in materials constitute a reason for attaching importance to this work.

AB - A dynamic statistical approach is used to predict dynamic stresses in a hyperboloidal cooling tower due to earthquake. It is shown that the configuration associated with one circumferential wave is the only one which is excitable by earthquake force and that the first mode of such configuration is dominat. On the basis of this, an equivalent static load is calculated. The data presented give coefficients for equivalent static loads, natural frequencies of cooling towers, and static stresses for a seismic load. The information given in the paper provides a simplified analysis to predict dynamic earthquake stresses in cooling towers.

AB - The results of two full-size simulated bridge joints of a chord member and splice on the Baton Rouge Interstate Bridge, a three-span cantilever truss bridge over the Mississippi River are reported. Also given are the results of five small control tests. Comparative information was obtained on the behavior of riveted and bolted joints. This included the magnitude and distribution of slip, the transfer of force in the shingled plates and their relationship to design. It was found that the slip behavior of the large joints was in reasonable agreement with the small control joints. Also, the overall deformation of the large riveted joint always exceeded the comparable deformation in the bolted joint at all load levels. The force transfer within the joint differed significantly from the force transfer commonly assumed for design.

AB - A general numerical procedure for the determination of lateral-torsional critical buckling loads for elastic beams of singly symmetric I-section is presented. The procedure mades use of finite element techniques, and is applicable to beams with arbitrary vertical and lateral supports and arbitrary loading. Expressions for elastic and geometric stiffnesses are developed, the solution of the eigenvalue problem is considered, and examples are presented. The method can be extended to the inelastic case.

AB - The investigation is concerned with estimating the strength of beams with reinforced rectangular holes assuming perfectly plastic behavior. Attention is restricted to compact sections and to holes located at the mid-depth of the beam. Experiments are described and a theory is developed which may be considered adequate in predicting, somewhat conservatively, the loads above which deflections will increase rapidly. The major assumption on which the theory is based, that is, the stress distributions at failure, are simple, and experimental evidence has confirmed them to be realistic. There is a reserve of strength available above the failure load predicted by the theory. Reinforcement welded on one side of the web performs as well as symmetrically placed bars up to loads in excess of the yielding failure load.
