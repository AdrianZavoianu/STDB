AB - A finite strip method of analysis is presented which can be used to analyze curved folded plate structures simply supported at the two ends and composed of elements that may in general be segments of conical frustra. The method is based on a harmonic analysis in the circumferential direction, with the loadings expressed by Fourier series, and on a finite element stiffness analysis in the transverse direction. The direct stiffness method is used to assemble the structure stiffness matrix and to determine displacements and element stresses. A description of a general computer program developed for the analysis and the results of several examples are also given.

AB - A stiffness method for the analysis of simply supported curved girder bridges with horizontal sector plates and vertical cylindrical shell elements is outlined. Stiffness coefficients of sector plates are presented herein whereas stiffness coefficients of shell elements are based on Hoff's solution of Donnell's equations. A numerical example illustrating the application of the method is shown. Some interesting results, particularly those with respect to the effect of radius of curvature, were obtained. A comparison is made between the results of a curved twin box girder bridge obtained by the proposed method and Tung's method.

AB - A method to evaluate the maximum flexural response of a soil-structure system when subjected to seismic excitation is presented. The flexible foundation medium is assumed to be represented by a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic half space whose dynamic properties can be characterized by stiffness and associated damping constants. The structure is an elastic single-story building situated on the surface of the foundation medium. Investigation into the response of numerous soil-structure systems leads to a set of design curves. When used in conjunction with the appropriate seismic response spectra these curves permit the maximum flexural response of the soil-structure system to be determined with relative ease. The maximum flexural response may be increased or decreased when compared to the response of the same structure on a rigid foundation.

AB - A computer program has been developed to analyze steel frames with or without shear walls which are subjected either to blast loads or to earthquake motions. Equivalent rotational springs are used at the ends of each member to account for the influence of axial load, the inelastic behavior (including the strain-hardening effect) of the member and joint distortion. Estimating the axial load and the point of inflection for each member, the relationship between the moment, M, and the relaxation angle, ΔΘ, of the rotational spring is calculated. The M-ΔΘ relationship may be modified to account for the presence of a semirigid joint or to include the shear distortion of the connection. Slope deflection equations are developed for members attached with rotational springs and are combined to construct a stiffness matrix for the complete frame. The dynamic equations are solved, changing the stiffness matrix so that it is compatible with the deteriorated structure at every instant of the motion. Examples illustrate the procedure.

AB - The elastic flexural-torsional buckling of simply supported stepped I-beams under a central concentrated load is examined theoretically and experimentally. The effects of the magnitude and position of steps on a beam's sectional properties are studied, and theoretical elastic critical load parameters are tabulated. Experimental studies are described and the results, which confirm the theoretical findings, are presented. A simple approximate method of predicting the elastic critical loads is proposed which appears to be either of close accuracy or conservative. The tabulated values and the approxmation should be of use in the design of laterally unsupported stepped I-beams.

AB - Bolted and fillet welded connections fabricated from flat sheets of thin low-ductility low carbon steels were tested as part of a research program investigating the influence of ductility on the behavior of cold-formed members under static loading. Material elongation in a 2-in. gage length ranged from 4% to 8%, while the tensile to yield strength ratio ranged from 1.0 to 1.1. Standard tension coupon test procedures were modified to distringuish between local and uniform ductility of the material. The load carrying capacity of the connections can be predicted by equations similar to those for high ductility steels.

AB - The dynamic characteristics (i.e., normal mode natural frequencies, damping, and shapes) of two suspension bridges are estimated from experimentally measured ambient motion time histories. These characteristics were estimated using random vibration theory and the power spectral densities of ambient time histories. Twenty normal modes of vibration were observed in the 0 cycle per min-60 cycle per min frequency range for the Newport Bridge in Rhode Island. These modes include nine vertical, six lateral, and two torsional deck modes, plus three longitudinal tower modes. For each mode, estimates are obtained of natural frequency of vibration, damping, and shape. For the other suspension bridge, the William Preston Lane Memorial Bridge, 13 normal modes of vibration were observed. These modes are six vertical, six lateral, and one torsional deck mode. No tower modes were observed in the 0 cycle per min-60 cycle per min frequency range.

AB - In Canada, plastic liners have been used exclusively, in preference to steel liners, for reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete secondary containment vessels for CANDU water-cooled nuclear power reactors. Considerable economic advantages have resulted. These applications are to low pressure containment systems up to design overpressures of about 30 psig. It is suggested that plastics suitable for higher overpressures are available. Secondary containment must be recognized as a system. The liner is a static part of the system. System reliability is however set by the more critical moving parts. The plastic liner is adequate to its purpose, as demonstrated by laboratory and field testing work and by accident analyses. Application of the liner demands special attention.
