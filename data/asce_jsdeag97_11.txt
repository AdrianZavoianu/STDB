AB - The east passage crossing of Narragansett Bay was forestalled by U.S. Naval operations until 1964, when a suitable site became available with the requirement that minimum clearances of 1600 ft horizontal and 205 ft vertical were maintained. This condition, plus esthetic requirements, demanded a suspension bridge. A central gorge in the alinement necessitated pile driving at great depths (100 ft and 140 ft) for the minimum span length. However, a longer main span length was found more expensive. Rock was located at minus 220 ft for the west tower pier and minus 432 ft for the east, and modified Potomac-type footings were selected. Pile cutoff was accomplished using a saturation diving unit. Footing forms were designed with variable buoyancy for controlled lowering. Of the remaining piers, some were constructed on piles or in the dry; and others on caissons drilled into rock, the technique used for the west anchorage. Significant features of the bridge superstructure include shop-fabricated parallel-wire cables, a unique cable anchorage, plastic rather than wire cable wrapping, and a new concrete deck curing-protective compound.

AB - The superstructure of the Newport Bridge embodies advanced features relating principally to aerodynamic stability, cables, cable anchorages, and cable wrapping. Wind tunnel tests were conducted on two bridge models, the original design and a design incorporating deck ventilation slots. The modified model showed significantly better aerodynamic stability, and was chosen for the final design. In other tests, this model also demonstrated the beneficial aerodynamic effect of adding a median barrier to the bridge roadway. Four barrier configurations were tested, with the tallest yielding the best results. The cables are wrapped in a unique plastic wrapping rather than being conventionally wire wrapped, while the concrete deck received a new coating that serves simultaneously as a curing compound and a protective covering against de-icing salt corrosion. In addition, the substantially all-welded cruciform towers were designed with esthetic considerations uppermost.

AB - Aeroelastic responses of 1/400 scale model with five masses were measured in a boundary layer wind tunnel to simulate the responses of twin triangular buildings in the turbulent wind at Century City, Los Angeles. Mean and RMS values of base shears, base bending moments, and base torque were measured for various wind speeds and wind directions. Frequency distributions and power spectra were obtained for the response parameters. No adverse effects were observed as a result of the close juxtaposition of two triangular prisms. Dynamic responses in bending and in torsion were predominantly in the fundamental modes of vibration. Base torsional moments were small in comparison with the base bending moments. Average peak values of the bending moments were 3.7 times the RMS values above the mean for time periods equivalent to 1 hr in full scale. The aeroelastic results were combined with the climatic data of Los Angeles to obtain an envelope of the maximum base bending moments with a probability of being exceeded in any year of 1 in 50.

AB - The elastic stability of structures leads to a linear eigenvalue problem of the type AX = λBX where A and B are symmetric and banded. A numerical method is presented to compute the critical buckling load, which is the minimum eigenvalue. The upper and lower bounds are estimated and using an improved interpolation technique the exact minimum eigenvalue is calculated. The buckling loads of nonuniform columns and isotropic and orthotropic rectangular plates with different boundary conditions are evaluated numerically. Estimates of the number of increments necessary for satisfactory results are also given. The method is general for all elastic structural stability problems.

AB - Because beams with web holes are being used increasingly in buildings, the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) is considering including provisions for such beams in a future addition to its Specifications for the Design, Fabrication, and Erection of Structural Steel for Buildings. To aid in preparing this addition, the ASCE Committee on Beams with Web Openings has prepared a list of suggestions which are presented herein. The paper first considers the applicability of both the allowable-stress design and plastic design parts of the AISC specification to beams with web holes are required. This paper presents material that is believed to be accurate and reliable for design purposes. However, this material should not be used for any specific application without independent examination and verification of its suitability for such application. ASCE disclaims any warranties regarding this report and anyone making use thereof assumes all risk and liability arising from such use.

AB - A theoretical and experimental investigation into the effect of sustained load on the ultimate load of eccentrically loaded slender reinforced concrete columns is described. The results of short-term loading tests on 26 pin-ended concrete columns and sustained loading tests on twenty similar columns at load levels of 0.4 and 0.6 of their short-term load carrying capacities are given. The latter show significant reductions in strength in some cases when the load is increased under short-term loading conditions following the sustained load period. An analytical procedure for predicting the behavior of such columns under successive short-term, sustained, and short-term loading is described. Comparisons between experimental and theoretical results show that the behavior of columns under both short-term and sustained load can be predicted closely using the proposed analysis.

The result for a redundant cable system indicates that even the reliability of redundant systems should also be based on the probability of noncomponent failure.
