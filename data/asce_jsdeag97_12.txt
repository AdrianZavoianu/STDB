AB - An alternative approach to the direct method analysis of a two-layer rectangular-mesh space truss is considered. A reduction in dimensionality of the problem is sought by deriving the differential equation for a plate equivalent in behavior to the space truss. The differential equation is found from the nodal equations of equilibrium of the truss in which the nodal deflections are expanded in Taylor series form. The direct solutions of a uniformly loaded square space truss with three alternative boundary conditions are compared with finite difference solutions for the equivalent plate under the same boundary conditions. The comparison of examples shows that the equivalent plate is satisfactory for estimating chord forces of a space truss except over concentrated supports. As the influence of boundary conditions is seen to be significant, care is required in interpreting deflections drived from an equivalent plate.

AB - An analytical technique is presented for determining the response of unstiffened inelastic suspension structures subjected to a change in loading, temperature change, or support settlement. The basis of the method is the principle of minimum total potential energy coupled with function minimization techniques. Two minimization techniques are used: the variable metric method, and the conjugate gradient method. The effect of scaling the potential energy surface to speed convergence is examined. Using a computer program, numerical studies of various types of elastic and inelastic suspension structures were conducted to demonstrate the value of the method. Several systems were analyzed incrementally until a load level was reached which produced an ultimate stress level, or zero stress, in at least one cable segment. These load studies demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the methods for problems with both geometric and material nonlinearities.

AB - A frequent cause for concern in concrete structures today is cracking due to the fall in temperature following the liberation of the heat of hydration. Cements with low heat of hydration characteristics are preferred for massive members (which have the greatest temperature rise). Unfortuantely, however, it is now evident that the criteria which are at present specified in either ASTM standard C 150-66 or BS 1370:1958 are very largely irrelevant. Modern cements have much higher strengths than formerly, they tend to be more finely ground and more rapid hardening, so that the inadequacies of these specifications have become increasingly apparent. The paper describes in detail the temperatures which were obtained in the thick raft of high strength concrete for the office block of the ATV Paradise Center, Birmingham. The predicted and recorded temperatures are compared and a very clear warning is made in the conclusions.

AB - A description is given of the successful construction of the first set of bridge cables using prefabricated and reeled parallel-wire strands in the suspension bridge of the Newport Bridge. Some sort of prequalification, or bidding by selective invitation, is recommended for the forseeable future. Economy of this method, as compared with wire-spinning, seems to be indicated by this project for a bridge of this size in the United States, but for the present, it would be wise to specify and permit both wire-spinning and the use of prefabricated parallel-wire strands as alternatives. For a long and large cable, the logical results would be a multiplicity of strands which are long, but of small section. It is extremely important to remove from each span of each strand to check the spread of wires, until it becomes clear that job practices are keeping spread of wires under control.

AB - Structural cables have been used as a building component since 685 B.C. but only recently have excited engineers to the application of cables to building and bridge designs. The advantage of structural cables as an economical tension member for bridges and buildings has prompted new design concepts of cable-stayed bridges and cable-supported roof structures. The expanded application of cables has resulted in the development by ASTM of Standards for structural strand and rope. The mechanical properties of strand, rope and preassembled parallel wire strands are presented in general terms. The manufacturing, fabrication, and connection of the ASTM Structural Cables are described to provide the engineer with an understanding of the products. A description of the manufacture and application of preassembled parallel wire strands is presented as the newest development for cable-stayed bridges and buildings.

AB - A double-layered grid in the form of a two-dimensional Vierendeel truss with stiff vertical members is analyzed for the case where member shortening effects are negligible. Field solutions are obtained in the form of double finite Fourier series which exactly satisfy the governing partial difference equations and boundary conditions for: (1) Foundation grids on spring supports; (2) building grids on four rigid supports; and (3) bridge grids with stiffened edges, each of which is free of forces on the exterior boundary. Each formula is numerically illustrated including a tabular presentation of six displacement fields for specific cases. The results comprise an extension of structural lattice theory to permit a closed analysis of the free edge case.

AB - Fabrication, preparation and instrumentation of a plastic model of a horizontally curved box-beam highway bridge is described. The model was extensively instrumented with rosette strain gages at three cross sections. Experimental data for three lane loading conditions was obtained. An approximate theoretical analysis of the model was obtained by using finite element method. A typical comparison between the experimental and theoretical stress distribution across the mid-span gage section for one of the loading conditions is shown graphically. The comparison shows a good agreement between the shapes but not the magnitudes of the stress plots obtained experimentally and theoretically. Experimental data at the three gage sections for each load condition is also given.
