AB - Twelve full-size columns were tested to supplement and extend previous tests of forty small-scale square columns. These lightweight adn normal weight concrete columns were compared with respect to initial shortening, time-dependent creep and drying shrinkage shortening, and ultimate strength. The measured shortenings were compared wiht those predicted by theory and good correlations were found. Ultimate strength was not significantly affected by the concrete type. The experimental findings of these two studies indicate that high quality structural lightweight aggregate concretes can safely be used in the columns of high-rise buildings.

AB - Fatigue tests on ASTM A36 steel wide-flange beams with rectangular web holes demonstrated the effect of stress concentrations at the hole corners on the fatigue strength of the beams. Under combined cyclic bending and shear forces at the hole, fatigue lives greater than 2,000,000 cycles were achieved without corner cracks when the corner radii were sufficiently large so that the cyclic stress range of the maximum elasticity boundary stress did not exceed 24 ksi. Good quality machine-burned hole surfaces were found to be sufficiently smooth to achieve lives of 2,000,000 cycles with no cracks at the boundary. Although additional work is required before detailed design provisions can be suggested, the tests indicated that for fatigue lives of 2,000,000 cycles, the corner radii of rectangular web holes in A36 steel beams should not be less than about 1 inch.

AB - Previous work on the solution of an eccentrically loaded beam-column under a concentrated load at the mid-span is extended. Expressions are derived for the moment expressed explicitly in terms of curvature and thrust for various shapes of structural sections with or without the influence of residual stress. Using these results, interaction curves relating axial thrust, lateral load, and slenderness ratio with various values of end eccentricities are presented for the maximum load carrying capacity of the beam-columns. The analytically obtained results are compared with those obtained previously by the numerical integration procedure and good agreement is observed.

Free standing and restrained arches with either fixed or hinged end supports were tested. A comparison is made between experimentally and theoretically obtained buckling loads for 20 different arch tests with fair to good agreement. The investigation provides additional verification of theoretical solutions based on a linear buckling theory.

Some of these factors are the natural frequency, the elastic limit, ultimate strength, the peak acceleration ratio and the normalized pulse duration. The effects of these factors are shown by means of critical structural isodamage curves which were developed and constructed in this study.

AB - The examination of theoretical stiffness ratios for reinforced concrete sections under uniaxial bending and axial load has shown that a reasonably simple set of approximate equations can be derived to enable a safe estimate of such stiffnesses to be computed. Due to the quantity of computing involved, the theoretical computations were limited to combinations of concrete strength and steel proportion within the practical ranges of 3,000 psi to 5,000 psi and 0.01 to 0.03 respectively, and to three proportions of cross-section geometry. It is customary to use either the uncracked or fully cracked stiffness in analysis. The method presented has the advantage of a more accurate estimate of stiffness in the middle range, though strain history effects should be incorporated, as wiht other methods.

AB - The results of an experimental and analytical investigation of the effect of non-uniform lateral confinement, such as that produced by closely spaced rectangular ties, on the behavior of concrete columns are presented. The main parameters studied were: flexural rigidity of lateral reinforcement, percentage of lateral reinforcement, concrete shrinkage, and strain rate. The effectiveness of lateral reinforcement, primarily depends on the flexural rigidity of the ties. The confining stress in columns with conventional rectangular ties is concentrated in the vicinity of the column corners and corresponds to the limiting state of confinement with corner forces. The stresses in the ties at maximum load are small and the concrete at some distance from the corners is nearly unconfined. Tie rigidity can be increased by cross bars welded to the ties. The added tie rigidity results in significantly increased ductility and, for small tie spacing in an appreciable strength increase. Comparisons are made with the results of other investigations, and a relation between strength increase due to ties and lateral reinforcement percentage is suggested.

The derivation results in a stiffness matrix which can be used directly in the stiffness formulation outlined by Scordelis for homogeneous folded plates.

AB - On the basis of the ground motions recorded in San Francisco during the 1957 earthquake, it is shown that ground motion characteristics varied markedly along a 3-mile section of the city, depending on the variation in soil conditions. It is suggested that building damage potential during earthquakes depends on either the induced/design lateral force ratio or the damage potential index and variations in these quantities are shown, both for the 1957 earthquake and for other earthquakes that may affect the city. Variations in soil conditions are shown to cause the response of structures to vary by factors ranging from 3 to 6, and the types of soil conditions causing maximum response in different types of earthquakes are discussed. It is suggested that building codes should reflect the potential variations in damage potential due to local variations in soil conditions by appropriate variations in design requirements.

AB - The research program explored experimentally the means of gathering information about the stress distribution within gusset plates. Of the various joining methods, bolting was chosen. Two load conditions, one which corresponds to high chord forces and another which corresponds to high web forces were selected. Three modes of load transfer were investigated analytically and the case of load transfer through the boundary of the plates was also included in view of its importance in judging the applicability of photoelastic models. Of the available finite element methods two were compared. Small scale photoelastic models also were tested and compared to the steel models. From the comparison of the experimental results and the analytical data, it appears that large model tests are not likely to yield much more information than the proper combination of small model tests and modern numerical methods. The present data show that an assumed load transfer through the boundary of the plate will still not significantly change the internal stress distribution pattern in the plate.

AB - The complete nonlinear equations of joint equilibrium are derived for three dimensional cable and truss structures using the direct stiffness approach for large joint displacements and small member deformations. The geometric stiffness matrix of the structure is derived solely from the geometrical and statical considerations of a perturbed equilibrium state. Various solution techniques are given for solving the nonlinear problem. Flow charts are given for modification of existing linear programs based on the direct stiffness approach. Several examples are given to illustrate the procedures and to emphasize the importance of nonlinear terms in the stiffness matrix.
