AB - This paper presents results of a theoretical analysis based on behavior of beams on elastic foundations and comparison with test data for deflection and proportional limit stresses of nailed joints under lateral load. A simple theoretical expression is derived which relates single shear load and joint slip for a laterally loaded, smooth round nail in a two-member wood joint. The expression accounts for nails of different sizes and materials, and for wood of different species by incorporating a foundation modulus determined from an elastic bearing constant proportional to the wood density.

AB - Interaction equation for biaxially bent beam-columns recommended by the Column Research Council Guide to Design Criteria for Metal Compression Members and other specifications is shown to lead to inconsistent predictions when applied to hollow tubular columns. A modified equation is proposed for such sections. Comparisons with small scale test results indicate that satisfactory predictions can be obtained using the modified equation.

AB - A method of analysis is devised for asymmetrical coupled shear wall structures. The individual shear wall piers, one story in height, are considered to be single elements in a stiffness matrix assembly for the complete structure. The stiffness matrices for such shear wall elements are developed on the assumption that such walls act as thin walled beams, and include the torsional warping effect and its corresponding force parameter, the bimoment. The stiffness matrices for the connecting beams are given a geometrical transformation so that their ends can be considered connected to the pier axes, i.e., their shear centers. When the entire floor slab can be considered as rigid in its plane, a modification is developed which results in considerable reduction in computer time and storage. Displacements and torsional stiffness are computed for a 23-story building consisting of two channel shaped piers connected at the flanges. Results compare favorably with previous experimental work.

AB - A method of analysis was derived to predict the behavior of columns under various loading conditions. A mathematical model was formed by dividing the column into a number of smaller elements. Shrinkage, creep, and stress effects were considered for each element. A modified superposition method for determining creep under varying stresses was developed. To verify the method of analysis, 64 tests were performed on slender pinned end columns. The columns had a 5-in. square cross section and a height-to-thickness ratio of 31. The effects of magnitude and orientation of the end eccentricities, and various levels of sustained load were investigated. Types of tests included: short-term load to failure; sustained loading to failure; and sustained load followed by short-term loading to failure. Sustained loading was carried out in a controlled environment. The durations of sustained loading averaged over 7 months with a range of 12 hours to 2 years. Close agreement between similar tests and a good correlation between related tests were obtained. Predicted behaviors compared quite well with the test results.

Inelastic beam and column behavior is considered. The column is a square hollow box in cross section and the beam is a standard H section. A series of model tests was conducted to verify the design procedure; the tests substantiate the theory.

AB - End tie plates in battened columns may contribute significantly to the buckling strength. Their effect is accentuated by the study of a spaced column, defined herein as the limiting case of a battened column in which the battens are attached to the longitudinal column elements by hinged connections. The strengthening effect of the end tie plates is due to two factors: (1) A shortening of the lenngth within which the column components can bend about their own axes and (2) the longitudinal components are forced to buckle in a modification of second mode shape and thus have elastic buckling coefficients that approach four times those of the first mode. In addition to their contribution to column strength, end tie plates perform their usual role of distributing the direct or moment applied loads to the component elements of either laced or battened columns.

The nonlinear behavior of tower and girder due to the existence of high compression forces in these members and the nonlinear relationsihp between the tensile forces and the deformation of cables are considered. All nonlinear terms are treated as imaginary external loads so that the solution of simultaneous differential equations becomes unnecessary. The method is suitable for digital computers.

AB - A simulation of the lateral ground motion of strong earthquakes is performed with the use of a random function generator and an analog computer. The statistical properties of the simulated earthquake are similar to those of actual earthquakes. The simulation is then used as the excitation applied to a structural system, which is also modeled on the analog computer. The statistical behavior of the magnitude of the peak response of the structure is established using a basic Monte Carlo technique with several simulations of the earthquake and associated structural response. The analog computer has the advantage over the digital computer in that several simulations can be performed in a relatively short period of time. The Gumbel Type I distribution of maxima is used to describe the distribution of responses. The experimentally determined statistical parameters relate directly to the seismic safety of a structure. In addition, a study of the seismiic reliability of the bilinear hardening system is given as an example.

AB - The object of this research was to determine the relaxation of stress for alloy steel bar prestressing tendons made in Australia. For convenience, the research work was broken up into three basic sections: (1) Determination of significant controllable and uncontrollable variables through literature survey; (2) development of adequate methods of measuring relaxation for different sets of variables (the apparatus developed was based on the load balancing principle); and (3) generalization of relaxation results through statistical design and analysis of experiments. A performance model was developed to allow predictions to be made; while in addition, quantitative relaxation values are recommended for adoption in current design.

AB - A kinematic approach to the collapse load analysis of plane structures is presented. Beginning with the inelastic rotation parameters and external work constants for a readily identifiable set of elementary mechanisms, linear programming is then employed to investigate all possible combinations and to find the mechanism with the smallest collapse load factor. Also found are the relative inelastic rotations of the plastic hinges appearing in the critical collapse mechanism, as well as the particular set of elementary mechanisms that combined to form it. Alternate collapse modes can also be found. The approach is based on the use of the Simplex algorithm for a digital computer. It is simple to apply and efficient in operation. The procedure is illustrated by two plane frame examples and a rectangular grid example.

AB - The state of knowledge of the in-plane bending and buckling of arches is summarized herein. There is a remarkable correlation between the critical thrusts for arches and columns. The buckling strength of nonprismatic arches can be accurately estimated by using prismatic arch equations with an average flexural stiffness which is easily determined. The buckling strength of symmetric prismatic and nonprismatic arch ribs of any shape and any symmetric loading can be estimated with good accuracy for any of the common support conditions. A review is given of methods for the bending analysis of slender arches and of simple, approximate methods for estimating the maximum effects. The approximate methods may be useful for the preliminary design of very slender arches and for the final design of less slender arches where the axial thrust is small compared with the critical value. In general, an accurate deflection theory analysis is recommended for the final design of very slender arches. The presentation is concerned with the available experimental and analytical data and with useful design concepts rather than with the various mathematical theories. The information is presented in a way which will make it helpful for design purposes. The review does not include shallow arches.

AB - A theory is presented, for the rational analysis of masonry walls under eccentric vertical compressive load, or under a combination of vertical compressive and transverse load. The theory is based on established concepts, which have been modified to account for the properties of masonry. Similar methods of rational analysis have been adopted for the design of steel columns and are in the process of being adopted for reinforced concrete columns. An investigation of the results of 192 tests of full-scale walls of various types of masonry construction established the feasilibity of applying this theory to closely predict the strength of these walls. The analysis accounts for variables not presently considered in the design of masonry structures. The correlation between test results and theory is illustrated by several typical examples.

Results for specific examples are presented as interaction diagrams between dowel shear capacity and dowel axial tension.
