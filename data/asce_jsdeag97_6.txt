AB - Several reliability-based structural code formats have been suggested in recent literature. To clarify their logical structure their differences and similarities are compared with reference to a set of formal postulates. Such a set is outlined and explained in detail: a postulate concerning the nature of the load; of the strength; a design procedure; a design principle (constant reliability with respect to a formal model and a body of knowledge); and other postulates relating to the format of an individual code. It is shown how a partial safety factor format can be calibrated to achieve nearly constant reliability within the framework of a member-by-member design theory. Explicit results are given for a simple second moment theory, and calibration is illustrated by an example.

AB - An experimental study carried out on a 12-ft x 12-ft hypar roof cable network model is described, and the results are compared with those obtained by using an approximate theoretical procedure for linear analysis of prestressed cable networks. A reasonably good correlation between the two sets of results is established, and on this basis it is recommended that, within the limitations specified, the theory can be used for preliminary design calculations. A considerable saving can thus be effected in the effort required in employing a nonlinear analysis procedure. It is also concluded that prestressed cable networks are not likely to exhibit a marked degree of nonlinearity when subjected to loads within the practical range. The details of the theory do not form part of this paper and can be found in existing literature (4,8) on the subject. However, the assumptions in the theory are reviewed. The paper gives the details of the experimental set-up. The procedure for prestressing the network, which may be found useful in the construction of cable roof networks is also described.

AB - Five full-size beam-column joint specimens were subjected to reversals of beam loading chosen to represent the effects of two earthquakes. Grade 60 reinforcement was used in these designs for edge, interior, corner and isolated joints. Conclusions were based on comparisons with earlier tests of joints with Grade 40 reinforcement. Increase in resisting moment due to strain hardening was an average of 22.6% for the specimens with Grade 60 steel compared to 10% for earlier test specimens with Grade 40 steel. Excessive increases in resisting moment after yielding may be detrimental to seismic designs. Shear reinforcement and anchorage details following the same patterns previously found satisfactory for Grade 40 reinforcement were found to be adequate for the Grade 60 reinforcement.

Termed structural reaction dynamometers, each device is essentially a small metal structure instrumented with electrical resistance strain gages. Details of the construction, gaging and calibration of each type are given. Service performances have shown each type to be satisfactory for most types of structural testing of indeterminate specimens.

AB - Lateral buckling loads are presented for parabolic arches loaded uniformly by means of either hangers or columns. Buckling loads for arches with hangers have been previously obtained by Godden who used a mathematical model for his analysis which differs from the gravity loaded arches considered herein. It is found that the two representations of the arch yield almost identical results. The torsional stiffness and the flexural stiffness of the arch in the lateral direction as well as the height-to-span ratio influence the buckling load. Buckling loads are given for height-to-span ratios ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 and torsional to flexural stiffness ratios from 0.01 to 1.6. The range of stiffness ratios covers arch cross sections of closed and open profile, but for certain thin-walled open profile cross sections the buckling loads are conservative because warping torsion has been ignored. An optimum height to span ratio is found to exist for each torsional to lateral stiffness ratio.

AB - The powerful technique of parametric differentiation is illustrated, coupled with numerical integration schemes for solving highly nonlinear problems in shell stability. As an example, the axisymmetric buckling pressures of clamped spherical shells of constant thickness, under external pressure are obtained. The application of this technique to the study of postbuckling behavior is demonstrated. This technique is equally applicable to the solution of a wide class of nonlinear differential equations arising out of various physical problems.

AB - New methods based on statics for the design of flat slabs and plates are prescribed in the Proposed 1971 ACI Code, and they supersede the old empirical formulas in use heretofore. Existing limitations on continuity and panel dimensions have generally been relaxed. While, without tests, the present limiting offset of 10% of the span between center lines of successive columns has been retained, it may be exceeded if resulting moments are verified by elastic analysis. Such a procedure is described and applied to cases of both half stagger and partial stagger of the column locations. It is concluded that the moment coefficients for square and rectangular panels may be used as a basis for the design of slabs having staggered columns with only minor modifications.

AB - The free flexural-torsional vibrations of beams of thin-walled open cross sections have been studied extensively. In previous investigations arbitrary boundary conditions on the translational displacements have been considered. However, treatment of the rational displacement which defines twist has been confined to boundary conditions where warping of the cross section is either entirely free or completely restrained. The degree to which partial fixity on warping affects the fundamental natural frequencies of the member is described herein.
