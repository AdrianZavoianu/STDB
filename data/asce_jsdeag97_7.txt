AB - The basic relationship is established between the stress-strain curve obtained from a stub column test and the basic column strength curve. Charts are prepared to allow the prediction of the buckling load of steel columns from stub column results. This approach simplifies the process of predicting column strength and eliminates full-scale column tests and the measurement of residual stresses.

AB - This paper develops an elastic-plastic analysis for the response of plates of arbitrary configuration subjected to lateral loading, under the assumptions of small deflections and Tresca's yield condition. The governing field equations are derived for the elastic and plastic portions of the plate, then solved numerically for a rectangular plate. The load is applied in increments such that yielding occurs at subsequent points in the plate, thus reducing the problem to a series of incrementally linear solutions. The method is applied to the special case of a square, simply supported plate under uniform load, and the results are compared with other solutions. Experimental work is also presented which confirms the analytical basis of the theory and shows its limitations.

AB - Results of 16 tests of small-scale prestressed concrete vessels are described. The vessels were designed to represent the end slab and a portion of the wall of a cylindrical prestressed concrete reactor pressure vessel with flat end slabs. The major variables in the tests were the end slab thickness and the magnitude of longitudinal and circumferential prestressing forces. The behavior and types of failure are analyzed. Two types of failure of the end slabs occurred. There were failures characterized first by radial cracking and ultimately by fracture of the circumferential prestressing. Failures also occurred which were initiated by inclined cracking in the slab and resulted in a plug with the shape of a truncated cone being pushed from the center of the slab. All except two of the vessels were pressurized with gas and the resulting failures were explosive in nature. Approximate methods are described for predicting both types of failure.

AB - Fatigue tests were conducted on rolled and welded steel beams to provide information that can be used as a basis for the development of design specifications. The principal variables were grade of steel, type of beam and detail, and stress variables. Three grades of steel were included in the study: ASTM A36, A441 and A514. Two of the four basic beam types investigated are examined hereiin, namely plain-rolled and plain-welded beams. It was found that: (1) Stress range was the dominant stress variable for all rolled and welded beams; (2) fatigue life was not significantly influenced by grade of steel; (3) rolled beams provided the longest life and the most scatter of the data; and (4) plain-welded beams without attachments constitute an upper bound for welded beams. The treatment of plain-welded beams the same as base metal or rolled beams grossly overestimates their fatigue life.

AB - A mathematical solution is derived which permits the computation of critical load, deflection and stresses for eccentrically loaded slender prismatic compression members made of materials that have compressive strength but no tensile strength. A graphical presentation of the solution facilitates its applicaiton. In an example of application, the solution is used to compute the strength of masonry walls which were tested by the Structural Clay Products Institute. Even though there are limitations to our ability of predicting the behavior of a complex material such as masonry by a mathematical solution based on a simplified model, there is good agreement between computed and measured strength.

AB - The buckling strength of axially loaded columns is examined by using the quasisteady statistical method. Material properties are considered as random parameters. Such an approach can provide a rational estimation of column strength in both the elastic and the inelastic range simultaneously as parameters vary. The procedure is explained by using the Duberg-Wilder model for tangent modulus buckling. Numerical results for wide-flange columns with the presence of residual stresses are obtained and are compared with pertinent experimental results and deterministic solutions.

AB - A method of analysis for stress in castellated beams and beams with web openings is developed in this paper using finite difference, theory of elasticity solutions for both pure moment and pure shear loadings. An experimental program to evaluate the theory of elasticity solutions was conducted using nine full-sized test members. Three types of castellated beams fabricated from 18WF45 rolled beams are selected for comparison of stress distribution and magnitude because these three members include two different slopes of web openings and no increment plates and a member with an increment plate. In addition, the method most commonly used at present for analysis of castellated beams-the Vierendeel analysis-is compared with both the theory of elasticity solutions and the experimental data.

AB - Existing experimental evidence for the stress-strain curve for concrete confined by transverse steel hoops or spirals is examined and used to determine the moment-curvature characteristics of flexural members with confined concrete. The stress-strain curve for confined concrete is represented by a parabola up to maximum stress, a linear falling branch followed by a straight horizontal portion. The slope of the linear falling branch is found as a function of the volume and spacing of the hoop steel and the strength of the concrete. The compressive stress block parameters for flexural members with different levels of strain at the extreme compression fiber and quantities of confining steel are found from the proposed stress-strain curve. The examination of the moment-curvature characteristics of beams with confined concrete showed that the quantity of confining steel only has a significant effect on the behavior of members with a high tension steel content and a low compression steel content.

AB - Highway accessory structures are essential for full utilization and continued service of modern highways. Culverts, retaining walls, bridge flooring and forms, guardrail, signs and lighting poles of steel have been developed since the coming of the automobile. Selection and control of steels for highway accessory structures are attained by means of ASTM and AASHO specifications developed jointly between representatives of the steel industry and highway organizations. Low carbon steels, which are strong, ductile and weldable, are available in hot and cold-rolled sheets, hot-rolled shapes, pipe and tubing. Zinc coatings are effective in prolonging life of steel both underground and in the atmosphere. Paint provides adequate atmospheric protection for steel. Certain high strength low-alloy steels of the weathering type may be used bare in the atmosphere. Steel's low cost and good workability along with its strength and durability provide a fine combination of desirable characteristics for highway accessory structures.
