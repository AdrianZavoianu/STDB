AB - The plastic analysis of transversely loaded plane frames using a direct application of Hill's principle of maximum plastic work is described. In this maximum work approach only the equations of equilibrium and the yield criterion at the hinges are used in the basic formulation of the problem. The comparative simplicity of this method is illustrated by examples in which a right-angle bent is analyzed using both circular and piecewise linear interaction curves. Single concentrated and uniformly distributed loads are considered.

AB - The development of a procedure for the optimum design of a roof system to yield minimum cost is reported herein. The roof system is composed of parallel chord, steel trusses, with purlins and decking. The variables considered are geometry, topology, and member size. The optimal values of the geometry and topology variables are determined by the application of Box's complex method. A fully stressed design criterion is employed in selecting the member sizes. Many calculations have shown convergence to a low cost region, although not necessarily to a global optimum. A cost model is developed that includes member-related costs and weight-related costs. Parameter studies demonstrate the importance of selecting the proper ratios of fixed and weight-related costs.

AB - The theory of elasticity is used to approximate the boundary conditions for a built-in edge for the problem of the bending of a clamped circular plate. The top and bottom surfaces are held in such a manner as to prevent vertical displacement, but they are smooth with respect to tangential shears. Loading is applied to the plate so as to insure antisymmetrical bending stresses. Results from the elasticity solution are compared with analogous solutions obtained from elementary plate theory and from a plate theory modified to include shear deformations.

AB - The minimum weight design of an orthogonal grid of beams spanning to interior columns or a perimeter is found for beam systems with constant geometrical proportion of cross sections. The variables are the spacing of beams on overlaying systems and the number of such systems used. Optimum solutions are found for working stress, ultimate strength of deflection governed design and a varity of degrees of beam continuity. The results include spacings and spans of all beam systems and an estimate of total structural weight in terms of basic material parameters. Examples of floors and roofs on steel I-beam systems are given.

AB - The framed-tube system is regarded as an economic solution for high-rise buildings. However, in view of the shear lag which occurs as a result of the flexibility of the spandrel beams, it is essential to predict accurately the structural behavior of the system. A simplified yet accurate method is presented for the analysis of framed-tube structures subjected to wind loads. By recognizing the dominant modes of structural action, the three-dimensional system is replaced by an equivalent plane frame by the addition at the corners of fictitious horizontal members with specially prescribed properties. The plane frame can be analyzed by conventional methods, and it enables larger problems to be treated on a given computer. The accuracy of the method is examined by comparing the results with those from tests on a 15-story perspex model, and from an analysis carried out by a standard three-dimensional space frame computer program.

AB - Fatigue damage usually occurs in certain typical members and details. Armed with this knowledge, an experienced inspector can evaluate the physical condition of a structure simply, effectively and economically by periodic visual inspections, supplemented by nondestructive testing. Discovery of fatigue problems during an inspection demands prompt evaluation and action on the part of the inspector. If the inspector himself does not possess sufficient knowledge of structural behavior to determine the necessary course of action, he should recommend at once to the proper authorities that professional structural consultation be obtained. For complicated, important structures it is often desirable to make a complete fatigue stress analysis of the structure, supplemented by visual inspections and nondestructive testing. Such an evaluation gives an indication of the possible locations of fatigue damage, and helps to place in proper perspective the significance of any cracks discovered. This type of inspection is advantageous in a structure where repair work or shutdown will result in considerable inconvenience.

AB - Local buckling of the compresison flanges reduces both the flexural stiffness and potential load carrying capacity of light gage beams, and must be taken into account in the design of such beams. Experimental and theoretical examinations of this problem are described for beams of lipped channel and trapezoidal sections. From the results of these examinations a straightforward direct method of obtaining the beam deflections for a given moment is formulated whereby the iterative procedure at present used in the AISI design manual is not required. Deflections calculated using this method are shown to agree well with experiments. A collapse criterion for these beams is compared with experimental collapse loads, showing good agreement. The extension of this analysis to suit light-gage beams in general is indicated.

AB - At a recent meeting of the Administrative Committee on Metals of the Structural Division, a need was expressed for the compilation of a glossary of terms pertaining to structural engineering and design with particular emphasis on steel as a construction material. Confusoin exists due to duplication of terms associated with the design of concrete and steel structures. An ad hoc committee was appointed to investigate the matter and render a report. The attached glossary is part of that report. This glossary is not complete by any means. It is a limited selection. The definitions are tentative and are being submitted for discussion. An attempt was made to have the definitions be consistent with the glossary of the second Edition of ASCE Manual No. 41, Plastic Design in Steel-A Guide and Commentary. The present report is intended as a beginning. A more complete sequel is envisioned. In the meanwhile, it may form a basis of more frequently used terms, especially in connection with design of steel structures on a maximum load basis.
