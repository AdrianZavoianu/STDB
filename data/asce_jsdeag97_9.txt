AB - Design methods based on a statistical approach to the prediction of dynamic effects of wind on frameworks of tall building are steadily gaining acceptance. Similar concepts can be applied to wind loads on cladding, although there are important differences such as exposure, size, and dynamic properties of the elements considered. Wind pressures and suctions at several points on a tall building recorded during strong winds are used to study the problem of predicting peak gust loads on windows and cladding elements. The statistical approach to the prediction of peak gusts, based on random process theory, is investigated. Measured peak pressures are compared to values calculated by a simple wind gust factor method and by a more detailed gust effect factor method. It is concluded that the gust effect factor method is preferable because it promotes a better understanding of peak pressures, but further field data and experimentation are needed before entirely satisfactory design estimates can be made.

AB - A method of solution for nonlinear problems of space trusses is presented based on a general approach for solving nonlinear problems in structural mechanics as formulated by B. Budiansky. The method leads to exact equilibrium equations valid for arbitrarily large strains and deformations and written using the known initial geometry of the structure. The strain-displacement relations used are exact and the stress-strain relations are approximated by polynomials. The equilibrium equations obtained are polynomials in the unknown displacements of the joints. The theory includes the effects of prestress and temperature changes. A computer program was developed using the Newton-Raphson technique for the solution of the nonlinear equations. The program can be used efficiently for the analysis and design of reticulated shells and suspended structures. Two particular examples are presented and the solutions compared with those obtained by existing approximate methods.

AB - This investigation deals with the behavior of fiber glass-reinforced beams with varying percentages of reinforcement. Conventional beams having similar percentages of steel reinforcement are used as control beams. The feasibility of the use of short, randomly oriented wires to improve concrete qualities when incorporated with fiber glass tensile reinforcement is also investigated. Twenty rectangular beams 6 ft in span (1.83 m) and subject to concentrated loads were tested to failure. It was found that fiber glass-reinforced beams were able to take a higher load than the corresponding steel-reinforced control beams. Their cracking and deflection behavior were also favorably comparable to the steel-reinforced beams at working stress levels.

AB - Investigations of concrete-polymer composites have indicated that remarkable improvements in the structural and durability properties of concrete can be obtained by monomer impregnation and in-situ polymerization by either radiation or chemical-initiators. Improvements in compressive, tensile, and flexural strengths of almost a factor of four times that of concrete have been obtained for samples containing 6 weight percent polymer. Significant improvements in durability were also noted. Methyl methacrylate-impregnated specimens have not failed after exposures of &gt; 1 yr to sulfate brines and 15% hydrochloric acid. Exposure to 5,120 cycles of freezing and thawing has resulted in essentially no attack.

AB - The fracture of the King's Bridge at Melbourne (1963) is of special interest because the responsible prior cracks were carefully photographed and the failure load can be estimated. With the aid of fracture mechanics and structural analysis, the critical crack size and failure load are compared with fracture toughness data for a steel regarded as comparable in toughness to that used in the Melbourne bridge. The results imply that rapid crack propagation developed when the tensile force on the crack was increased to a value intermediate between the crack propagation resistances expected for rapid (impact) and for slow loading. Structural redundancy of the Melbourne bridge allowed the bridge to provide continued service for 12 months after one of the four supporting girders suffered a major fracture. It is suggested that analysis of expected crack sizes and fracture toughness can be used to estimate the degree of fracture fail-safe behavior potentially present in steel bridges.

AB - A computerized numerical approach is presented for computing the maximum load carrying capacity of steel columns under biaxially eccentric load with eccentricities of loading different at each end. The computed results are compared with the existing analytical and experimental studies and good agreement is observed. The effect of warping restraint at the column ends, cross-sectional shape, and residual stresses on the ultimate strength of the column are studied by using various examples. Interaction curves obtained for and equal eccentricity case have been used to compute ultimate loads for columns with eccentricities of loading not equal at the two ends. A reasonable agreement is observed between predicted ultimate loads from interaction curves and those obtained analytically or experimentally.

AB - Test data from four continuous rectangular beams, imply supported over two 15-ft spans are reported. The only variable in the test is the relative amount of deformed steel bars and precast prestressed concrete prisms used as tension reinforcement over the intermediate support. Use of prestressed reinforcement at intermediate support regions of beams, controls crack development and propagation at those locations and improves the overall flexural rigidity. Optimum results are obtained when prestressed reinforcement is used shortly after they are cast, when they are placed as close as possible to the extreme tension fiber, and when they are accompanied by a small amount of nonprestressed reinforcement. Plastic curvatures at a hinging region may be considered to extend over a distance equal to the effective depth of the beam plus the width of the distributing plate. Hinge rotations and moment redistribution are not influenced by the relative prestressing index ratio. Because of their better serviceability criteria, beams with prestressed reinforcement could be allowed higher design percentage moment redistribution.

AB - A study of the effectiveness of web reinforcement in reinforced concrete beams subject to axial forces is reported, involving the testing of 60 simply supported reinforced concrete T-beams and eight restrained reinforced concrete T-beams. The primary variables were axial force, the amount of web reinforcement, the concrete strength, and the shear span to depth ratio. Secondary variables were the web reinforcement yield point and the amount of flexural reinforcement. Measurements were made of applied loads, deflections, web reinforcement strain, and diagonal tension crack width. The effectiveness of the web reinforcement was found to be unaffected by the presence of axial forces. The design procedures for beams with web reinforcement contained in the ACI Building Code, ACI 318-63, were found to be conservative. Relationships are proposed which more closely reflect the variation of ultimate shear strength with variation of relevant parameters.

AB - Castigliano's theorem is employed to derive the general equilibrium equations governing geometrically nonlinear structural behavior. Three different formulations are presented for the solution of these basic relations, namely, Newton-Raphson, incremental, and initial-value. The application of these solution procedures is considered and the significance and interrelation of various terms in each formulation is pointed out. In each formulation, a particular matrix, termed the nonlinear stiffness matrix, is seen to appear. The individual coefficients of this nonlinear stiffness matrix are presented for pin-jointed bar and plane-stress triangular elements. The nonlinear stiffness coefficients are seen to be simple and easy to apply since they are given in terms of the geometry of the undeformed element and require no coordinate transformation. A physical interpretation is made of the nonlinear stiffness matrix through comparison with the geometric stiffness matrices used in incremental approaches. Application of the new formulation is made to highly nonlinear frame and shell problems.

AB - Recent research on the interaction of flexural, shear and truss action and a recognition of the increasing use of high tensile strain-hardening reinforcement, prompted this experimental reconsideration of the behavior of the critical beam section at the beam-column connection. In addition to a control test, six different systems, ranging from a point-loaded simple beam to a two-span continuous system incorporating both column and column load, were tested in each group of experimental models. Proportions of tension reinforcement and tie spacing constitute the variables for the different groups of models tested. The experimental results demonstrate that the column and its loading have a significant influence on the postyield behavior of the beam critical section. Models other than the two-span system which incorporates both the column and its loading, yield nonconservative values for inelastic rotation. It is demonstrated that any simply supported system is an unacceptable quantitative model of the beam-support section. Some of the implications of using strain-hardening reinforcement are also outlined.

AB - A study of the free vibrations of elastic circular arches is presented, demonstrating the application of a particular direct-iterative eigen-solution method. The model consists of a sequence of straight beam finite elements connecting nodal points lying on the circular elastic axis of the arch. The effect of rotatory inertia is included, but transverse shear deformations are neglected in the analysis. The use of a finite element model facilitates determination of energy distribution in each mode, and permits quantitative analysis of the nature of the frequency spectrum for circular arches of various slenderness ratios. Results also include tables of natural frequencies for circular arches.

The analysis is conducted with probabilistic considerations and parameter studies of ground motion, concurrent and unidirectional response, various degrees of design reduction of cantilever overturning moment, elastic and inelastic behavior, changes in column inflection points, and variations in actual column strength. Probabilities of damage are obtained for columns designed by USD and WSD procedures under seismic code requirements and then subjected to estimated strong earthquake motion as key elements of the building.

The antenna's critical, electrical requirements imposed on the structural support system dictate that the support system must basically be nonmetal. This criterion was successfully fulfilled by the use of asbestos-cement pressure pipe towers and fiberglass rods as tower guys and suspension members. This coupled with the development of a unique procedure for the assembling and erection of the long antenna by working at or near ground level and then lifting it into place, made it feasible to bring the antenna into realization. Included are descriptions of material testings, quality controls, and method of antenna erection.

AB - A new earthquake code formula is proposed, based on the principles of the response spectrum technique considering the local soil conditions. Six different groups of soil are defined from the viewpoint of their predominant periods. After the natural period and fraction of critical damping are estimated, for a structure, the seismic forces may be evaluated by means of these idealized spectrum curves more realistically than would be possible from an existing building code formula. The soil structure period relations and the possibility of resonance which are usually overlooked in the provisions of the earthquake codes, are duly taken into account. The formula is also intended to evaluate the seismic forces of structures other than ordinary buildings, such as bridges, dams, towers, elevated tanks, chimneys, etc. For the purpose of emphasizing the need for a new approach, the earthquake response of a hypothetical 10-story reinforced concrete building under two different subsoil conditions is included.

AB - The most critical components of coupled shear wall structures are the short and often relatively deep spandrel beams, formed between door or window openings. These may be subject to high intensity alternating flexure in the presence of large shear forces when the structure is exposed to seismic disturbances. The behavior of these beams, when subjected to monotonic one way loading, was previously reported by the writer. In this paper the more interesting features of the performance of relatively deep spandrel beams, subjected to seismic type of alternating static loading, are presented. In the experiments the performance of the flexural reinforcement, the deterioration of the stirrups with high intensity alternating loading was observed. The principal modes of failure were identified and the stiffness degradations were evaluated from rotational measurements. Some evidence is presented with respect to the available ductilities for two types of steel arrangement and the effectiveness of beam repair.
