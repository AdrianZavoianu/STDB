AB - In the present study, the structure of the shedding forces from a slender tapered structure was studied in considerable detail in both smooth uniform flow and turbulent shear flow. From this study a simplified description of the forces in shear flow is developed and successfully employed to predict the response of an aeroelastic model. A significant finding is that the maximum response in the fundamental mode occurs when the shedding frequency at about one third of the stack height is equal to the natural frequency. The observations made during the study are employed to develop an equation that might be used to predict the behavior of full-scale structures. The significance of loads due to vortex shedding from tapered structures is examined. For typical concrete structures it is deduced that drag loads are likely to be dominant with regard to stresses over the lower 2/3 of the structures while vortex excitation of the second mode is likely to be the dominant consideration for the upper one third or thereabouts.

AB - Theoretical approaches to the evaluation of the response of slender structures in turbulent shear flow have been proposed by a number of researchers. There are, however, limited experimental data supporting these developments and the assumptions upon which they have been based. In the present paper, the theory is reviewed briefly and the assumptions and necessary data examined in the light of recent experimental results. The theory is applied to predict the response of a slender tapered stack of circular cross section and the predictions compared with experimental observations of the behavior of a model stack in boundary layer flow. It is demonstrated that quasisteady approximations are adequate for wavelengths greater than about five to ten times the width of the structure and that the extension of the quasisteady approach to shorter wavelengths will, in general, yield a small overestimate of response. It is also shown that estimates of aerodynamic damping based on quasisteady assumptions are adequate.

AB - The fatigue of welded tubular joints, as found in offshore structures, is explored by developing a qualitative model. This model considers the influence exerted on the initiation and growth of fatigue cracks by secondary effects of the joints fabrication and behavior. The model is then used, along with basic concepts from fracture mechanics, to develop an analytical model for the prediction of fatigue failure. The behavior of the tubular joint undergoing fatigue is divided into three phases: primary phase—no noticeable effect from fatigue; transition phase—decaying behavior; and secondary phase—distinctly new behavior. Fatigue failure is then defined as a distinct change in the joint's load transfer characteristics (the end of the transition phase). Experimental data is presented to support both this definition and the theoretical prediction of failure.

AB - Because presstressed concrete Vierendeel-type poles are cheaper than other types in India, millions are required to provide rural electrification. Using an optimal design for these repetitive-type components, considerable savings can be realized. The paper presents an optimal design using the Selected Active Constraints Technique (SACT), and a systematic synthesis. The direct design procedure is generated. Design behavior and loadings are treated as input and geometrical properties are systematically derived. The design procedure, based on SACT, requires extensive experience on the part of the design engineer, however, the calculations are simple. A design example is presented using physical data obtained from the Gujaret State Electricity Board (GEB), India, for a 8.53 m, 204 kg pole. Cost analysis is made, using prevailing prices in India, to show the economic gain obtained by the optimal design. The optimal design shows an economy of 18% in material cost per pole and 35% in high tensile wire weight, for the example considered.

AB - Explicit expressions are derived for the collapse and elastic post-buckling of simply supported, geometrically imperfect plates with stress-free edges. For the purposes of design, such plates can be taken as representative of the stiffened compression elements of thin-walled structural sections. Different generalized geometric imperfection parameters are studied and the effects compared to established test data obtained from cold-formed steel sections subjected to either bending or compression. For these sections a suitable and completely general parameter describing the imperfection amplitude, e0t, of a plate of thickness t is shown to be e0=0.2σy/σcr in which σy is the yield strength of the plate material; σcr is the theoretical local buckling stress of the equivalent ideal plate and is a direct function of its width to thickness ratio. This parameter is recommended for the design of cold-formed steel sections against local buckling.

AB - Elastic perfectly plastic theory predicts progressive permanent deformations of statically indeterminate structure with each cycle of variable repeated loading above the so-called shakedown load. Experimental evidence of this behavior, however, is contradictory. In an effort to explain some of the observed discrepancies, a theory of incremental deformations is developed which includes the effects of strain hardening of the material. On the basis of calculations, the importance of strain-hardening is assessed, and results of two earlier test programs are used to verify the validity of the approach. On the basis of comparison of analytical and experimental results, it is concluded that strain-hardening must be included for realistic prediction of the incremental deformations of steel structures.

AB - To facilitate rational design in this relatively new material, influence of matrix composition and wire mesh properties on impact and tensile strengths were studied. The possibility of increasing strength to weight ratio by substituting foamed lightweight sand for natural sand was investigated. Leakage tests were performed for specimens under tension and subjected to impact. Ductility of steel and specific surface of wire mesh appear to be the most important properties influencing cracking performance and thus the leakage rate. Lightweight sand gives the same tensile strength but lower compressive strength of ferro-cement specimens than those for natural sand. Ferro-cement can be designed to have tensile strength which is comparable to its compressive strength and it can be watertight under design conditions. Results suggest that it may be a potential material for construction of thin shells such as for boat hulls, for transportation of LNG and for deep submersibles.

AB - When the structure is subjected to repeated stresses with cyclic constant magnitudes, the resulting fatigue life is known to be random. In reality, structures are subjected to various levels of repeated stresses. To facilitate the design of a structure subjected to a stress history with given load repetitions at each of several stress levels, a fatigue damage factor and a damage index are introduced as design parameters. The problem is formulated with the use of the Palmgren-Miner's cumulative damage theorem, by treating the denominators in the theorem as random variables rather than constants. The design diagrams suggested can be constructed from single stress-level fatigue test data. The design approach needs only to draw parallel lines in the design diagrams in the case of structural design against multi-stress-level fatigue. To illustrate the relationship of the fatigue damage factor to cyclic stresses, number of cycles and failure probabilities, two numerical examples are also given.

AB - A simple iterative procedure is presented for solving rectangular plate problems in which the opposite edges are not simply supported. In this method, an attempt is made to approach the exact solution by successive corrective of boundary conditions as in the moment distribution method. Using the proposed method, a numerical solution has been obtained for two problems, viz., (1) a rectangular plate clamped along all edges; and (2) a rectangular plate elastically supported on all edges. The results indicate that the solutions converge rapidly to sufficiently accurate results.

The analytical formulation of the force-deformation equations in terms of the rate of change leads to a linear relationship between these quantities. Solutions are obtained by the tangent stiffness method and a digital computer. The method is found to be extremely powerful and efficient for computer solution.

This paper presents model test data, augments the scope of prototype analyses, and establishes three-way correlations among prototype and model data and theoretical analyses. Additional studies are made of transverse distributions of live load resisting moments to prototype stringers, including effects of an intermediate diaphragm and barrier railings on those distributions. Three-way correlations of resisting moment distributions are very good. The theory exaggerated slightly the influence of the diaphragm by assuming it to be rigid. Influence of the barrier curbs was accurately assessed. Theoretical transverse strain distributions did not always agree with those observed.

AB - The influence of various significant parameters on the required structural fire protection of buildings is examined. In particular, the influence of the probability of the occurrence of fire, the size of the building, and the variation of fire loads and fire resistance of structures are considered. Expressions are given for the probability of failure of structures by fire and the fire loss expectation. By balancing costs and benefits, using probabilistic criteria, the justifiable fire protection measures in buildings can be determined in a rational way. It may be expected, therefore, that with information obtained in this way optimum fire protection measures can be determined more accurately than will be possible by present methods, which are entirely based on judgment and experience. How close the optimum measures can be approached depends to a large extent on the accuracy with which the values of the parameters that determine these measures are known.

AB - A method of analysis is presented to predict the complete load-displacement relationship for large multistory structures. The structures are composed of sets of planar bents arranged in two perpendicular directions. The structure is assumed to deform in these two principal directions and twist about a vertical axis. The actual structure is replaced by an analytical model in which the number of unknown displacements have been considerably reduced. Slope deflection equations, modified for plastic hinging, are used to relate the member displacements to the end moments. The secondary moments due to the column axial loads acting through the sway displacements are considered in formulating the equilibrium equations. The effects of axial shortening, changes in axial load, variations in stiffness and carry over factors, and shear deformations are not considered. The effect of the asymmetry of the structure is illustrated by the results of an analysis of a 10-story structure.

AB - A method is developed for the optimum design of large framed structures. Optimization is carried out iteratively by partitioning the structure and thus dividing the optimization problem into a number of smaller subproblems. In the solution of a subproblem only part of the design variables and constraints are considered. Analysis is performed by the stiffness method. An approximate method for reanalysis of the substructures is suggested. The partitioning approach and the reanalysis method are based on the fact that changes of a design variable of one substructure do not appreciably affect the behavior of the other substructures. The cost function is set up for the whole structure and the subproblems are optimized by a direct search technique using external penalty functions on the constraints. Numerical examples of beam and beam grid structures demonstrate applications of the method.

The buckling of beams and cantilevers is studied in this paper, and theoretical critical loads are tabulated for a wide range of sections. The loadings considered include central concentrated loads on beams, end concentrated loads on cantilevers, and uniformly distributed loads, and these are applied at various distances above or below the shear center axis. It is shown that while the effects of monosymmetry and of height of the point of application of the load above the shear center on the critical loads of simply supported beams are additive, the reverse is true for cantilevers. The differences of opinion as to the effects of monosymmetry are resolved by an experimental investigation, the results of which support the most common expression for the monosymemtry section property.

AB - Investigations are made on the influence of column deformations on the stress distribution in flat slab structures, which are assembled from rectangular plates and columns with rectangular cross sections. The plates are assumed to be simply supported on two parallel edges and are supported by edge-beams of arbitrary stiffness properties on the remaining edges. The columns, which may have capitals, interact by vertical forces and two bending moments with the plates. The corresponding stresses are assumed to vary linearly. The deflection surfaces of the plates under external loads and the unknown column reactions can be represented by simple Fourier series. These unknowns will be determined from the conditions of geometric compatibility between the columns and the plates which are established by the principle of minimum complementary energy. The method is given in matrix notation and is very suitable for electronic computations. A numerical example illustrates the influence of columns with different flexibilities on the stress distribution in a flat slab.

The method is applicable to the design of rectangular multistory planar steel frames with coplanar loading. A minimum section property configuration is determined to resist the factored gravity load condition alone. A story-by-story optimization procedure is then utilized to determine a favorable force distribution in the frame in order to minimize the additional steel that may be required to resist the factored combination wind plus gravity load condition. For both braced and unbraced frames the method proportions beams, columns, and braces in accordance with the 1970 AISC Manual of Steel Construction Specifications. For braced frames, the method also examines the question of where bracing members should be located, given that there is some flexibility in this regard. An iterative design procedure is used to account for the P-Δ effects. The method described is part of a larger system which also includes a consideration of elastic stress and elastic lateral deflection constraints.
