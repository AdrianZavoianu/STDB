AB - In order to have a completely automated design system it is necessary to have an automatic procedure for generating new, improved design including new, improved connectivities. As a first step in this direction, it is shown herein how a heuristic procedure manipulating the system graph can be combined with an algorithm for geometrical optimization to produce a truss design procedure which exhibits adaptive behavior.

AB - Extensive tests on inverted umbrella and saddle-shaped models indicate that the design of thin-steel hypar roofs is usually governed by stiffness, rather than by stress limitations. The rise-span ratio and the shear rigidity of cold-formed decks are the most important factors determining the stiffness of the structure. Deck buckling is causd by the uniform shear stresses in the shear-diaphragm type of action of the shell which dominates the response of hypar shells. This experimental investigation yielded empirical design information in thin-steel hypars and also provided checks on other analytical studies.

AB - A method is presented for determining the maximum safe loading with its associated stress system for prismatic, reinforced concrete, folded plate structures on simple end supports. The method is based on the satisfaction of equilibrium required and on complying with criteria which impose limitations on the magnitudes of the lonngitudinal stresses and the transverse moments. The linear programming method is used to evaluate pertinent stress parameters so as to maximize the load factor. Computer programs, developed towards this end, are described. The method is applied to two examples involving model structures which were previously loaded to failure by others.

AB - A differential displacement of the supporting system of a hyperbolic cooling tower is modeled by a five column segment of the shell base. An explicit relationship between the relative displacement and edge-load is derived from the Boussinesq solution for a semi-infinite sheet and adapted to the differential settlement model of the shell. Based on an approximate homogeneous solution to the bending theory equations for a hyperboloid of revolution, the boundary conditions are specified in terms of the stress resultants from the consideration of overall equilibrium and compatibility. An example shell with the dimensions of a typical hyperbolic cooling tower is studied to show the in-plane and bending stress resultants due to a unit relative displacement.

AB - Aluminum square tubular sections subjected to axial compression generally exhibit a significant reserve of strength above the critical stress levels associated with plate buckling. Load-transverse deflection curves averaged over the four faces of each of six specimens with different slenderness ratios B (width to thickness) validates the nature of behavior predicted in an earlier paper. Membrane action for slender plates (60.8≤B≤106) dominates behavior in the vicinity of the critical load so as to elevate the rate of resistance to load with deflection. Elastic-plastic behavior with its attendant deterioration of stiffness begins to predominate prior to the attainment of the ultimate load resulting in a plastic mechanism at large displacements. Stiff plates (30.8≤B≤45.5) reach ultimate load without the characteristic membrane response and immediately tend to follow a mechanism unloading line.

AB - Procedures are developed for the optimum design of welded plate girders by the 1969 Specification of the American Institute of Steel Construction. The problem is a nonlinear optimization problem in which many of the design variables are defined only at discrete value because steel plates are available only in certain increments of width and thickness. Simple supports are assumed, and loading may consist of a combination of a uniformly distributed load and concentrated loads. The objective function is the estimated cost of the girder. This function is not unimodal. Backtrack programming is used in selecting the optimum girder. The vector of design parameter values is built up one component at a time by testing parameter values in modified criterion functions to determine if there is a possibility that a more economical girder is available than the best found previously. For symmetrical girders with symmetrical loadings, there is an option to include the investigation of reduced flange plate thickness at the span ends.

AB - The combined strength and deformation analysis of plastic frames is formulated both as a quadratic and a linear programming problem. The quadratic programming approach permits the strength and deformation analyses to be performed simultaneously. Alternatively, the linear programming approach permits the two analyses to be performed in at most three sequential, LP applications. The sequential LP approach is adopted to solve four examples. Solutions include: (1) the collapse-load factor; (2) the collapse mechanism; (3) the bending moment distribution at collapse; and (4) the complete elastic-plastic deformation profile at incipient structure collapse.

AB - In very high and slender frames with very stiff members, the safety against long-wave buckling modes involving axial extensions requires investigation. The problem is solved exactly for a planar regular rectangular frame of rectangular boundary, compressed between two sliding rigid half spaces. The problem is reduced to a system of six linear first-order difference equations which are solved in terms of discrete complex exponentials. Because the coefficients of the determinant to varnish depend on axial loads nonlinearly, by means of explicitly inexpressible complex roots and eigenvectors of another 6 times 6 matrix and the well-known nonlinear stability functions, the critical load is determined numerically by a procedure analogous to the method regula falsi. The ratio of column critical force to column Euler load depends eessentially on the ratio of column and beam bending stiffnesses, the ratio of building slenderness to column slenderness, and weakly on column slenderness ratio.

AB - The stress distribution in cylindrical web panels of horizontally curved girders subjected to an applied moment is studied analytically. Both the membrane state of stress in the plane of the web and the web bending stresses resulting from the curvature of the panel are considered. A simplified mathematical model which treats the web as a series of curved strips (arches) is used. Solutions for this model are obtained using the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The influence of curvature on the resulting stresses in curved webs is presented. Recommendations for the allowable bending stresses in curved beams expressed in terms of the web depth-to-thickness ratio as well as limiting web slenderness ratios are established.
