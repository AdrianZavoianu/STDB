AB - An arch culvert, under a 240-ft. (73-m) embankment, was tested to assess influence on structural behavior of four methods of backfilling, including Method A, employing well-compacted structure backfill; imperfect trenches with various inclusions; and straw surrounding the barrel. At the time of fill completion, stresses due to footing rotations were not great under Method A backfill, but increased appreciably at some stations 2 years after fill completion. Where baled straw surrounded the barrel, severe stresses were indicated due to footing rotations at the time of fill completion—footing rotations and stresses decreased in the 2-yr period following fill completion. In general, good foundation conditions prevented large stresses due to footing differential displacements.

AB - Herein is presented an approximate method of analysis for structures composed of shear walls and frames. The structure is reduced to an equivalent frame and an equivalent wall with appropriate values of EI and appropriate plastic moment capacities. The plastic moment capacities of the beams are reduced to allow for gravity loads on the beams. Second-order Ρ-Δ moments are accounted for by equivalent lateral loads at each storey. These loads are calculated in an iterative procedure. The analysis is checked against a more rigorous analysis.

AB - A method of constructing curved sandwich shell roof structures is presented which requires virtually no forming, shoring or bracing and allows the majority of work to take place at ground level with the roof in a flat configuration. Experimental and numerical (finite element) analysis techniques are discussed. Two models of such buckle-shell structures (a cylindrical shell and a groined vault) with urethane foam cores and glass reinforced polyester skins are described. Results of experimental investigations of the behavior of these two models are compared with numerical solutions obtained by the finite element method. It is concluded that the results of this work demonstrate the potential for the use of structural plastics in building structures.

AB - A method is given for the analysis of nonlinear trusses which can be partitioned into a series of statically determinate substructures such that each substructure is coupled to two adjacent substructures. In the case of such structures, the number of independent variables to be determined in order to evaluate the forces in all the members is considerably reduced. The method is the same as the state space analysis herein used for controlled systems. The formulation given results in a set of operator equations with the interacting forces between the substructures as dependent variables and the properties of truss elements as independent variables. The method is applied to trusses having conservative, nonlinear elements undergoing small deformations. The resulting set of equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson technique.

AB - An analysis was developed which considered the structure, continuous foundation and supporting soil as a single compatible unit. The influence of the choice of model for the soil (Winkler or linear elastic) on the moments induced in the foundation was studied for a typical three bay frame and for a range of soil and foundation stiffness. It was evident that the conventional method of analysis and the soil-line method overestimated the negative moments in the foundation but underestimated the positive moments. The bending moment diagrams were similar for both soil models for the three bay frame but for four or more bays the bending moment diagrams are vastly different. The maximum bending moments for the two models is opposite in sign.

AB - With the advent of digital computers it has become possible to analyze suspension bridges taking account of hangers as individual members. As the behavior is nonlinear satisfactory convergence is most likely to be obtained in the solution of the governing equations if a Newton-Raphson method is used for correcting the basic variables. Compatibility and equilibrium methods are developed which produce symmetric equations to be solved at each iteration. By suitable choice and ordering of the variables these equations can be made to fit well into a variable bandwidth store thus producing an efficient form of computer solution. The most efficient of these methods is the compatibility method in which the horizontal component of hanger force is ignored. In cases where the stiffening girder is a Warren truss the compatibility method also shows advantage, but in other cases the equilibrium method is likely to be preferred because the equations are more easily constructed.

AB - Urban sprawl has increased the frequency with which windstorms interact with structures. The Lubbock Storm (May 11, 1970) and Hurricane Celia (August 3, 1970) provide the most recent examples of storm incidence on populated areas. The responses of engineered structures to extreme winds are characterized by window glass breakage and failures of nonstructural components, each of which can lead to progressive failures of the structure. Pre-engineered buildings experience wind induced progressive failures because of overhead doors which are not designed as integral parts of the structure. Failures in pre-engineered buildings include buckling of purlins and girts throughout the structure due to wind induced outward pressures, and buckling of purlins spanning between end frames and first interior frames due to wind induced axial load. Marginally engineered structures (including residences and some light commercial buildings) experience wind induced failures which are the result of inadequate connections between roofs and walls, and between walls and foundations, i.e., the result of the buildings not being designed as integral structures.

AB - This paper considers the problem of the effect of absolute size on the shear strength of reinforced concrete beams. The results of previous tests are compared and a brief description is given of the way in which beams carry shear force, which is consistent with recent data. Tests on a series of 15 beams in which true scale models were used, with a depth range of 150-1000 mm (6-40 in.) are described. The test results indicate that, when beams are modeled correctly, the effect of absolute size is small. In practice it may not always be possible to design beams of the type in which the size effect is insignificant. For these cases, design advice is given.

The slope-deflection equation solution of the orthotropic plate equation is used to obtain parametric results. These results are combined with simple beam behavior in deriving the equation. The equation is applicable to orthotropic steel deck bridges which have either open or closed type ribs.

AB - An experimental study was conducted on steel angle and tee struts to provide verification of the theoretical solutions for flexural, torsional-flexural, and plate buckling. The effect of slenderness and width-thickness ratios was examined for single angle struts and double angle struts with separators, with hinged and fixed end conditions. The slenderness ratio was varied from approximately 21 to 89 and the overall width-thickness ratios ranged from 10.0 to 17.3. Tests on 27 tee sections with hinged ends were also conducted. Good agreement is shown between the experimental and theoretical results. It is suggested that the flexural, torsional-flexural and plate buckling stresses be computed as per the established rational buckling theory and the least value be taken as the critical stress for the given strut.

A prescribed response spectrum and modal analysis are used to determine the seismic design forces. The members of the frame are proportioned using ultimate strength concepts. Important design parameters are the expected girder ductility requirement and the rate of strain hardening. Ten story single bay frames are designed according to the proposed procedure and according to the standard allowable stress procedure. These frames are subjected to two strong motion earthquakes and the inelastic response is evaluated.

AB - Beams with continuity over supports may be fabricated and erected by means of prismatic members of somewhat longer lengths than the spacing between supports, and is simply lapped and connected (bolted, etc.) to the corresponding member in the adjacent span. The continuous beam is composed of a doubled section over the supports, where the bending moment is ordinarily greatest, and a single section over the midspan. Charts are presented of parameters required for the moment-distribution analysis of continuous beams formed of members with double sections at one or both ends, the equations for the connection force required between the adjacent elements of the beam, and the analytical procedure. By judicious arrangement of overlap lengths of adjacent members, the resulting moments at critical points in the beam can be manipulated to reduce the bending moment at maximum points, while increasing the moment at minimum points.

AB - Many different theoretical models have been proposed for the flexural-torsional buckling of inelastic steel beams under uniform moment. These models are considered and what is argued to be a more accurate model is proposed, which is based on the tangent modulus theory of buckling, which uses the strain-hardening moduli for the inelastic material, and which accounts for residual stresses. The predictions for this model for a W 8 x 31 beam are compared with those for the previous models and the relative significance of the assumptions are determined. It is found that the critical moment of the beam is not very sensitive to the assumptions concerning the moduli of the inelastic material, but that the effects of monosymmetry induced by the residual stresses should be accounted for. The most important assumptions are found to be those of the magnitude and distribution of the residual stresses, which cause significant variations in the strength of the beam.

AB - Two methods based on: (1) the direct finite difference approach; and (2) the dynamic relaxation method are presented for the treatment of the elastic large deflection behavior of plates under transverse loading. The merits of the methods in respect of formulation, accuracy, storage and computing time requirements are pointed out together with the main aspects of the finite element method for the analysis of the same problem. The large deflection behavior of square plates under a central patch loading (a concentrated load distributed over a finite area) is investigated. Numerical solutions are offered in a general and condensed form for plates with simply supported and clamped boundary conditions, and for a range of patch sizes. The solutions are shown to be of particular value in the assessment of stresses under a patch loading in practical plate problems. The solutions can serve as a useful guide line for the advanced design of the plate components of plated structures.

AB - A general formulation for the in-plane and flexural stiffnesses of isotropically and nonisotropically reinforced concrete plates is presented. The stiffness of plates is related quantitatively to the relative orientation of the reinforcement with respect to the applied forces, the combination of the applied forces and the amounts of reinforcement in the two orthogonal directions. By rotating the reinforcement from 0° to 45° with respect to the axes of the applied forces the in-plane or flexural stiffness may be decreased to one-half or less. The investigation did not support conventional theories to calculate flexural stiffness such as those in the 1971 ACI Building Code. In general, the ACI Code Equations considerably overestimate flexural stiffness. Results of this investigation can be used to calculate bending moments, deflections and effectiveness of reinforcing bars in cracked concrete sections.
