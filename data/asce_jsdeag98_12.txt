AB - An analysis is presented within the context of finite deformation theory to describe the behavior of linearly elastic members of thin-walled open cross section subjected to biaxial bending and a compressive load. Governing differential equations are presented which permit the computation of a consistent set of large translations and twist. Load-deformation curves are presented for a typical beam and beam-column, and comparison is made with displacements based on small displacement theory. It is shown that the differences between large and small displacement theories are significant when the loading exceeds approximately 80% of the critical value. In the case of the beam-column, loading is extended beyond the buckling load.

AB - Based on an assumed model of crack formation, expressions are developed for maximum crack spacing and crack width in reinforced concrete beams in pure flexure. Both the maximum crack width at the tension surface of the member and the maximum crack width at the surface of the reinforcement are considered, and the former and an upper bound on the latter are related to the crack spacing through a slip modulus between the concrete and the steel. Various physical parameters involved in the expressions are evaluated by use of elastic finite element analysis and through statistical analysis of crack measurements available in the literature. These data are then used to provide approximate expressions which make it possible to predict maximum crack width at the surface of the reinforcement and at the tension surface of flexural members.

AB - A theory is presented which predicts the crack width and crack spacing in the constant moment region of a reinforced or prestressed beam. The theory is based on the same assumptions as the classical theory of cracking for reinforced concrete. Instead, however, of assuming a bond stress distribution, the bond slip characteristic of the steel is used and this results in the bond distribution continually changing as the steel stress increases. The theory is used to investigate the effect of a variation of the main parameters on the crack width and crack spacing of theoretical tensile specimens reinforced with strand and deformed bar. It is shown that, for a given steel stress at cracks, the crack width depends mainly on the maximum bond strength of the reinforcement and the crack spacing depends mainly on parameters Î¨ and m, the tensile strength of the concrete, and the maximum bond strength of the reinforcement.

AB - Buckling loads of space rigid frames based on large deflection theory were determined herein by a method referred to as the constant load method. In this method, the load is maintained at certain constant level and the deflected position which will provide the necessary internal forces to balance the external load is determined by iteration. The load is then increased to the next level and the process repeated until the process becomes divergent or the determinant of the stiffness matrix becomes zero. The advantages of the method are: (1) the direct application of stiffness coefficients developed for the small deflection buckling and (2) the possibility of starting iteration at any level. Verification of the method with various published examples was made. An illustration was made for the determination of large deflection buckling mode of a symmetrically loaded framed dome.

AB - Tests on steel plates without overt stress concentrations show that hot dip galvanizing reduces the fatigue strength by only about 4% in zero to tension cycles. Galvanizing, in the presence of a notch, reduces fatigue strengths by up to 28% at some stress levels in zero to tension cycles. An analysis of the results indicates that this reduction is due to the loss of ductility of the galvanized steel plate as compared to the as-rolled (black) plate. Initial coefficients of friction for galvanized plates in these tests (0.12) were about one half of the value for plates with mill scale (0.21). In tests on high strength bolted joints, under reversed loading, galvanized joints locked up after a few cycles of load, and cyclic slip ceased. Because of this action and the fact that fatigue failures of the connections occurred in front of the net section, the fatigue strength of galvanized friction type connections was comparable to that of identical black connections in zero to tension and one half compression to tension cycles.

AB - The Finite Element Method of analysis was used to determine the buckling loads of the web plate under patch loading together with simple supporting shear forces. Combinations of patch loading with shear loading or with in-plane bending moment are also studied. The results are presented in the form of interaction curves which show that the applied edge load necessary to buckle the panel is reduced by the presence of either an additional in-plane moment or shear. Tests are carried out on light gage cold formed troughs. The test results show that there is a considerable amount of post buckling strength for panels having high slenderness ratios. A linear relationship exists between the ratio of the ultimate load to the buckling load and the relative length of the loaded patch and the slenderness ratio of the panel. Failure of all test panels is associated with the formation of a localized yield curve under the load.

AB - An economical connection of intersecting square structural tubes can often be achieved by welding horizontal members, the beams, directly to a continuous vertical member, the column. The present investigation was limited to connections between square compact tubes of the same size. Combined loading tests were conducted on 11 fabricated specimens; five tests were with 4 in. sq (0.102 m) tubes and six with 6 in. sq (0.152 m) tubes. A theoretical analysis of strength was also made. The investigation showed that the strength of unreinforced connections in compact square tubes can be conservatively estimated by superposing interaction diagrams for: (1) General yielding in the arms due to combined bending and torsional moments and (2) localized column failure due to combined local buckling and crippling under axial load and bending. Equations for the construction of such diagrams are given.

AB - A general methodology is outlined for the closed-form solution of the basic differential equation of torsion for any straight, nonprismatic, open section beam configuration. Six specific cases of single span, variable-sectioned beams under torsional loading were examined by this exact procedure. The algebraic and design chart formulations of these solutions are described. These results are particularly useful for analysis of coverplated bridge and building members. A numerical technique, employing the finite differences method, is developed as a versatile and expedient alternative to peforming a closed-form examination. The basic interior mesh equation and the modified mesh patterns near the boundaries (pinned and fixed) are included. The finite differences results are compared with the closed-form theory, and are shown to be very accurate and reliable. Model testing of partially cover-plated wide-flange beams provided very reasonable correlation with the non-prismatic, closed-form solutions for various cases of boundary conditions.

AB - The Task Committee on Lightweight Alloys has prepared this guide for the design of transmission towers. The Executive Committee of the Structural Division decided that no specification shall be issued in the name of, nor endorsed by, the Structural Division of ASCE. Specifications may be prepared by Task Committees of the Structural Division, ASCE, working alone or jointly with other groups. This guide is concerned with the design of transmission towers, for all voltage levels, constructed from aluminum in the alloy 6061-T6. The methods may also be extended to cover other alloys. Fasteners are usually bolts of either aluminum or protected steel. Fabrication and testing methods are also considered. The guide should be considered as one means of designing a tower which will sustain the specified ultimate loads without significant permanent deformation.
