AB - A direct stiffness method for analyzing structural plates which possess nonlinear material properties is developed to predict the ultimate load of certain plates subjected to lateral loading. Because of the mathematical complexity of the problem, a numerical technique is suggested whereby the continuous plate is replaced by interconnected beam elements whose physical properties are determined by forcing the moment-rotation behavior to be identical with that of the plate. This technique yields a model that assumes concentrated plasticity and distributed elasticity. The success of the beam model is made possible by approaching the problem from a differential point of view and using a three-parameter moment-rotation equation. The solutions are then obtained using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration technique.

AB - A three-dimensional finite element method for general anisotropy materials is presented. The method uses a parallelepiped element and includes the directional properties of the materials, making it easily applicable to problems in wood mechanics. By varying the stiffness and allowing some elements to assume zero stiffness, a variety of shapes can be studied, including those with cracks and voids. The limitations of the method are primarily related to the available computer storage and to the fitting of rectangular-sided elements to curved boundaries. Examples are presented to indicate the types of problems this technique is capable of solving. These examples include wood mechanics problems of compression, both parallel and at angles to the ring and grain, tension of a member with holes, and torsion.

AB - A survey of structural problems on offshore rigs indicates a need for a better understanding of fatigue loading produced by dynamic effects initiated by the oceanic environment. For general design purposes a valid loading spectra might be produced by measuring elastic strain cycles in selected oceanic areas, over extended periods. Examination of a typical strain sensor output shows that the record can be handled as counts of cyclic loading at preselected magnitudes. These indicate the loading spectrum for that particular area, and also can be used, in association with Miner's cumulative damage hypothesis, to provide an estimate of the damage produced by the loading history. A simple instrument is described which will count the number of times particular strain levels have been exceeded. Numbers of counts can be printed out automatically for periods of up to 8 weeks, and can also be read manually at any time. Special provision is required if long term variation in mean strain is to be corrected.

AB - The theoretical equations describing lateral buckling of deep beams attached to a nailed wood deck were verified by experiment. Because the effects of beam depth and span length on lateral stability are well known, the experiments were designed to study the influence of deck stiffness on stability of a beam-deck structure. A pair of deep beams, with attached deck, was loaded with end moments to produce pure bending in vertical planes parallel to the longitudinal axis of the beams. The critical bending moment at which lateral buckling of the beam-deck structure occurred was observed for several decks having different shear stiffnesses. Observed critical bending moments were within 7% of those predicted by theory. It was found that critical bending moments twice those for unsupported beams could be obtained with a deck of moderate shear stiffness fastened to the compression side of the beams.

AB - Sixteen elastic tests and three ultimate load tests on A36 steel W 12x45 beams with reinforced rectangular openings in the web at middepth are described and analyzed. The experimental variables were the moment-shear ratio at the opening and the details of the horizontal reinforcing bars which were used above and below the openings. It is concluded that fillet welds placed on only one side of the reinforcing bars provided an adequate connection to the web, both for one and two-sided reinforcing bars, and that the use of reinforcing bars on only one side of the web had no interpretable effect on the strength and behavior of the beams. It is also concluded that designing the extension of the reinforcing bars beyond the edges of the opening to develop the strength of the bars in the welds is a reasonable and satisfactory approach to this detail.

AB - A finite element computer procedure is developed, based on the matrix displacement method, for the analysis of large prestressed networks. The mathematical theory including the effect of the nonlinear contribution of the so-called geometrical stiffness are first reviewed on a novel basis. The iterative attainment of the equilibrium is considered in detail, both as far as theory and practice are concerned. The important question of the determination of an initial trial geometry of the network surface in which the equilibrium is only satisfied approximately is considered next. Attention is also paid to the layout of the initial net on the mathematical surface. The last main section reviews the practical organization of a network analysis in a computer. Following the assembly of the initial data, the measures are enumerated which are necessary for ensuring a given prestress condition. Finally practical steps for accelerating convergence and the selection of a simplified net are presented.

AB - Two four-story structures are excited by the 1940 El Centro Earthquake NS component. In one structure, all floors are strained beyond the elastic limit, whereas inelastic deformation is prevented in the first floor of the other structure. An elasto-plastic load-deflection hysteresis loop and a trilinear load-deflection relationship are assumed for evaluating the time history of the maximum strain at the critical section of each floor. The cumulative low-cycle fatigue damage factors are calculated for different fundamental frequencies of the structures. The variation of the maximum deflection of a floor with reference to the floor below is also studied and is shown to be different from the corresponding variation of low-cycle fatigue damage factors. Though the low-cycle fatigue damage in the first floor is more than that in the other floors, the safety of the frame as a whole is not improved by stiffening the first floor. In general, the stiffer structures are damaged to a greater extent than the flexible ones.

AB - Three-dimensional indeterminate elastic trusses subjected to multiple loading conditions are optimally designed for least weight. The member areas and joint coordinates are treated as design variables for problems where a reasonable initial geometry is specified. Members are designed to stress and Euler buckling limits and linking constraints between area variables. The fully stressed design is assumed optimal. Coordinate variables may be linked to maintain geometric symmetry. The design problem is, in effect, divided into two separate, but dependent, design spaces—one for member sizes and one for coordinates. While changing coordinate variables, the member areas are treated as dependent variables. Design of larger structures by sequential design of substructures is illustrated. Examples are presented with computer run times (UNIVAC 1108, FORTRAN V) ranging from 28 sec for a 25-bar space truss to 2 min for a 47-bar planar tower. Design of the tower by substructure required 1 min. Significant weight reductions are reported when geometric changes are included in the optimization process.

Indeed, his contributions followed naturally from his insistence on simplicity of statement, from his habit of seeking interrelationships, and from his ability to ask questions which lead to answers.

The technique can be used with computer facilities, or manually making use of current design standard alinement charts. The relevance of this frame critical load to the design of individual columns within the frame is considered from the point of view of allowable pure axial stress and of moment magnification effects.

AB - In this paper, the differential equation for the nonuniform torsion of tapered I-beams is derived by analyzing the deformations of the flanges, and this equation is used to study the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of simply supported tapered I-beams. For constant flange beams which are tapered in depth, it is found that the changes in the torsional stiffness with the degree of taper are small, and that consequently the elastic critical loads do not vary greatly. The elastic critical loads of constant depth beams which have tapered flanges decrease significantly as the degree of taper increases. Torsion tests were carried out on tapered depth cantilevers and the results of these were in close agreement with the theoretical predictions. Buckling tests were carried out on simply supported I-beams which were tapered in flange width, thickness or web depth, and the experimental critical loads confirmed the theoretical predictions.

AB - The Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) in collaboration with the Forest Service Division of Engineering, has a continuing research program to improve timber bridge design and performance. The program covers field evaluations of existing bridges, laboratory evaluations of new or revised design criteria, and experimental field bridge studies. Much of the engineering research was concentrated on the design of vertically glued laminated wood panels for bridge decks. The results of both laboratory evaluations and experimental field bridge studies have indicated a glued system to be structurally superior to the conventionally used nailed-laminated decking. The use of glued panels should result in an overall economic saving in bridge costs and will greatly extend the service life of timber bridges.

AB - The lateral buckling strength of many flexural members designed to resist wind loading is greatly increased by the lateral constraint of the tension flanges provided by the attached structure. Graphs are presented which enable designers to quickly evaluate the effect of this constraint and further to evaluate the additional effect of torsionally fixing the member compression flanges. Within the practical range of parameters these combined effects can raise the buckling strength by a factor of at least 2.7 and possibly as great as 10. The method of solution of the buckling equations used is sufficiently general and straightforward so that solution of rigid frame buckling for a variety of constraints and load distributions can be carried out with a desk calculator.

AB - Coupling of load effects is illustrated herein by considering the probability of failure of an elastic beam-column. For lateral and axial loads with uniform distributions, it is shown that the safety of the members is reduced when compared to the usual method of determining load effects by linearly superimposing the stresses due to the two sources.
