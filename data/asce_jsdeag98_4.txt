AB - Experimental investigations reported on the fatigue behavior of orthotropic steel bridge decks have been rather limited. Results of fatigue tests on steel orthotropic decks with both conventional and biserrated trapezoidal ribs are presented. In the first phase, tests on two types of deck to rib plate welded connections unflanged and flanged ribs, and on two types of rib splices butt joint and diaphragm splices reveal that the unflanged rib to deck plate connection and the butt joint rib splice exhibit satisfactory fatigue strength. Results of the second phase, involving decks with biserrated ribs subject to AASHO wheel loads, indicate that an optimum serration radius can be determined, and that fatigue cracks developed at lower serration corners do not result in the total collapse of the deck.

AB - The behavior of a single two-span, three-cell plexiglass model is predicted by the Slope Deflection Fourier Series Technique. This analytical technique had previously been applied to only open cross-sectional, I-type, bridge systems. The model was tested under various static concentrated loads. The resulting experimental deflection, rotation, and strain data for some loadings are reported. Effects of single and multicell torsional properties are examined. Results indicate that single cell properties can be applied in the analysis, and warping effects may be neglected.

AB - The objective of this literature review and bibliography is to provide a guide for structural engineers who are interested in studying the problem of structural safety. To present a fairly complete picture of the field, the review is divided into five sections treating load analysis, strength analysis, dynamic structural analysis, structural reliability analysis, and design aspects. Although it is not necessary to have a background in probability to read this review, the reader is encouraged to study some elementary theory of probability and statistics before he attempts a very detailed study of these topics. The Bibliography is intended to provide a wide choice of references in English; however, there was no attempt to make this exhaustive. In spite of some effort to include the more significant publications, it is unavoidable that some major papers have been inadvertently omitted.

AB - A finite-element analysis of reinforced concrete structures is presented. The solution is based on a two-dimensional analysis. The analysis includes the elastoplastic behavior of steel and concrete and the limiting tension criterion for concrete. The nonlinear problem is solved as piecewise linear one and introduced the effect of nonlinearities in material behavior by means of a stress transfer process. The results of the numerical examples are compared with the available solutions. It is emphasized that such a nonlinear analysis is necessary for a realistic stress distribution in reinforced concrete structures due to the redistribution of stresses resulting from the progressive cracking of concrete.

AB - The ultimate load of single span and multispan horizontally curved girders is predicted by a superpositioning method. The yield criteria is in accordance with (M/Mp)²+(T/Tp)²=1, which is valid for composite beam sections. Design aids are presented which permit the determination of the ultimate load as referenced to the behavior of straight girders.

AB - A hypothesis based on the assumption that the plastic strain amplitude during any given cycle of stress is an index of the induced fatigue damage is presented. The hypothesis is shown to yield an exponential cycle to failure-stress range relationship and a stress-dependent damage-cycle ration equation. All the material constants necessary are evaluated from the results of constant amplitude tests. The endurance predictions of the hypothesis were checked against the results of the series of variable amplitude repreated block tests performed.
