AB - Results are presented from a series of tests on perspex models to illustrate the behavior of three-dimensional shear wall structures subjected to combined bending and torsion. Three 20-story models of varying complexity were employed, representing the cross-wall form of construction associated with apartment blocks. Deflection profiles are presented for all wall assemblies, together with the bending stress distribution at specific levels. The results are compared with those from an influence coefficient analysis based on the continuous connection technique. Good agreement is reached between theory and experiment, the discrepancies being least when torsional deformations are small compared to flexural deformations. The theoretical analysis indicates that a considerable redistribution of load between the different structural elements occurs throughout the height of the building.

AB - Tests on composite steel-concrete beams have shown these sections to be highly susceptible to local buckling under negative bending. To further the application of plastic design to continuous composite beams an approxiamte method of predicting the moment-rotation curve of a locally buckling I-shape is developed. The method is based on the upper-bound plastic limit theorem. Solutions are given for two buckling mechanisms and their applicability is determined from test results and web slenderness criteria. Comparisons between the theoretical predictions and several test curves show consistently conservative, but reasonable agreement.

AB - The earthquake design of a 37-story steel building is described. The structural solution is a flexible perimetral tube which resists the seismic effects and conforms to the side-sway limitation imposed by the Venezuelan seismic code. The spatial properties of the perimetral tube were taken into account and analyzed by a mathematical model representing a plane frame image of the three-dimensional structure. The mathematical model is able to evaluate the shear transferred at each floor level to the frames perpendicular to the action, across the corners of the building. An adjustment of the dynamic response of the building in relation to the minimum base shear design imposed by the code was made because no representative earthquake response spectrum has been recorded in Caracas. In order to evaluate the influence of axial deformations and the importance of shear transfer at the corners, comparative analyses with and without shear transfer at the corners and with and without axial deformation of members were made and reviewed.

AB - The limit states design concept is employed. Relations expressing statical properties of the cross section; geometry of the system; and equilibrium, continuity, and strength-conditions are respected, goverened by a properly selected decision function; four decision functions are observed. These relations are expressed in terms of three parameters: web-slenderness, section-asymmetry, and a chord-parameter. Web-slenderness being selected, the latter two parameters represent the only unknowns. Their values follow from solving two rather involved analytical expressions, to which the mentioned numerous relations can be reduced. They are handled numerically by the use of Fibonacci's search and an iterative method. An appropriate organization of results enables the setting up of simple design formulas, with coefficients expressed through the aforementioned three parameters. A table with these sizing coefficients is prepared for a representative scope of characteristic cases.

AB - Fourteen hollow concrete cylindrical hulls ranging in length from 8 in. to 128 in. (20.3 to 325.1 cm) and having an outside diameter of 16 in. (40.6 cm), and a wall thickness of 2 in. (5.1 cm) were subjected to hydrostatic loading to determine: (1) the effect of cylinder length-to-outside-diameter ratio (L/D0) on the implosion pressure and strain behavior; and (2) the distance from the edge of the cylinder in which radial displacement was influenced by the end closure. Test results showed that the ratio of implosion pressure to uniaxial concrete strength Pim/f'c decreased as the L/D0 ratio increased from 0.5 to 2, and then the Pim/f'c ratio became constant. Thus, an infinitely long cylinder was one having an L/D0 ratio≤2, the effect of the end closure on the behavior of the cylinder becoming negligible at a distance≤1 diameter from its edge. The average implosion pressure for infinitely long cylinders was approximately 2,500 psi (17.2 N/mm²) or a simulated depth in the ocean of 5,500 ft (approx 1,680 m).

AB - The free vibration of a guyed tower has been analyzed taking into account the effect of the masses of the guys. Linearized differential equations of motion were derived for a guyed tower based on the assumption that the static deflection shape of the guys is a catenary. The results were evaluated to determine the effect of the following parammeters: (1) Effect of the static shape of the guys; (2) number of degrees-of-freedom of the mast and of the guys; (3) ambient temperature on the dynamic behavior of guyed towers.
