AB - Theoretical moment-curvature relationships for reinforced concrete members with cyclic loading are derived using stress-strain curves for steel and concrete. The theoretical curves compare well with test results and illustrate the variation in flexural stiffness due to the Bauschinger effect of the steel and to the presence of open cracks in the compression zone of the concrete which may eventually close. These cracks mean that for large portions of the moment-curvature curves after the first yield excursion the moment of resistance is provided by a steel couple alone. During this part of the cyclic loading the main role of the concrete is to prevent buckling of the steel. For beams with a marked difference between the top and bottom steel areas and for columns the moment-curvature loops show a pinching in effect and the loop area is significantly smaller than that of the commonly used elastoplastic idealization.

AB - The results of several analyses of a 24-story structure are presented. The structure is composed of two series of orthogonal bents; the bents consist either of steel rigid frames or of steel rigid frames coupled to reinforced concrete shear walls. The analysis used to predict the response of the structure is an approximate elastic-plastic technique which first lumps the members of each bent into an equivalent structural model. The results presented illustrate the change in behavior which accompanies an increase in the eccentricity of lateral load or an increase in asymmetry of structural arrangement. The effect of increasing the torsional resistance of the vertical element or shifting the positions of the stiffer bents, is illustrated. A reduction in ultimate strength is predicted (below that for the symmetrical case) whenever the secondary moments are effectively increased. This may be achieved by increasing the eccentricity of lateral or vertical loads or by changing the structural arrangement and ranges up to 66% in the extreme case.

Special elements are developed to capture both the membrane and plate bending behavior of the deck and web components. The well established direct stiffness method is used for the element assembly. The structure may be subjected to a variety of force and displacement boundary conditions such as distributed dead and live loads in addition to concentrated nodal loads and prescribed nodal displacements. After solving for the unknown nodal displacements, the reactions are computed in addition to the internal forces which are output at points selected by the user.

AB - There was a severe earthquake at the Koyna Dam on December 11, 1967, with its epicenter very close to the dam site. The higher monoliths of the dam suffered significant damage during the earthquake. In order to corroborate the observed behavior of the dam with its behavior anticipated theoretically, the highest monolith of the dam has been analyzed due to the actually recorded ground motion during this earthquake. The theoretical analysis indicates the zones of maximum tensile stresses which coincide with the location of cracks in the dam monolith confirmed by observation after the earthquake. The maximum tensile stresses in these zones are found to be higher than the ultimate tensile strength of the dam material and thus cracking is expected in these regions. The theoretical techniques of analysis thus adequately explain the distressed behavior of the dam and can confidently be applied to predict the performance of dams during future earthquakes.

AB - Computations to obtain the ultimate strength of an inelastic beam-column are fairly involved and, at present, only numerical methods are available to get the best possible solutions in most cases. This paper presents simple approximate forms of solutions by assuming an idealized relationship among moment, curvature and thrust in the ultimate state. The ultimate strengths of beam-columns are obtained in simple closed forms. Although they are approximate solutions and their validity has been shown only by comparison with exact solutions for strong axis bending of a side-flange section in symmetrically loaded cases, the method developed can be applied to other shapes of section with only a slight modification. This validity is considered to be true in unsymmetric cases also as long as the unsymmetricity is not very large. The formulas for the ultimate strength of beam-columns may be considered as suitable bases for a method of design for symmetrically as well as unsymmetrically loaded compression members.

AB - The ultimate load characteristics of thin-walled box girders are investigated. The objective was to arrive at basic ultimate design criteria. Of primary importance was the development of theoretical relations that would accurately predict the ultimate load for a given cross section. The theoretical load-displacement relations are idealized to consist of a linear elastic portion up to the ultimate load and a horizontal portion at ultimate load. Four models were tested to failure to verify the theoretical relationships. Deflections, rotations, load, and strains were measured for each ultimate load test. Results indicated good comparison between experimental and theoretical values. Specific ultimate design criteria are presented and suggested design methods reviewed.

AB - The first major steel-deck railway bridge in America, the 2110-ft single-track Kansas City Southern Railway bridge over the Arkansas River near Redland, Oklahoma, is a continuous box-girder structure having nine spans. Approximately 2400 tons of ASTM A588 (50-ksi yield) weathering steel, left unpainted, were used. The 24 individual box units, ranging in length from 42 ft to 117 ft and in weight from 44 tons, were shop-fabricated by welding. At the site, box units were bolted together in trains behind each abutment and rolled or launched across the spans, supported on sliding-type (skidway) units located at the abutments and piers. The two trains met and were spliced at the middle of the channel span. An extensive erection strength investigation was required because each girder panel had to pass across one or more skidway units and therefore had to be adequate to withstand the various combinations of moment, shear, and reaction that occurred. Web and flange erection strengthening and stiffening were found necessary. Pier and abutment stresses and stability were reviewed.

In addition, hyperbaric facilities have been extensively utilized for medical treatment. The requirement for larger sizes of hyperbaric chambers and higher pressures, as well as the involvement of personnel as occupants and operators of hyperbaric facilities make it mandatory to take all necessary precautions to avoid accidents or incidents and to provide for casualty recovery. Herein the requirements that should be met during the certification process for materials safety of shore based new hyperbaric facilities, are outlined.

AB - A procedure for evaluating the lateral response of staggered truss framing system subjected to a prescribed base motion is developed for use on a digital computer. Actual trusses of the system are represented by equivalent trusses, having the same lateral stiffness and strength as the actual trusses but fewer members. The inelastic activity is restricted to the chord members in the central panel of the trusses. The moment-rotation behavior at the ends of these chord members is assumed to be of a bilinear hysteretic type with the stiffness in the yield region taken as 5% of the elastic stiffness. A 20-story structure designed by current code procedure and subjected to 1.5 times the El Centro earthquake of 1940 is analyzed. The results indicate that the columns in the system are primarily axial force carrying members with very small end moments and there is substantial inelastic activity in the trusses.

AB - A circular cylindrical finite element is combined with beam elements to provide an efficient numerical method for the solution of stiffened shell problems. The analysis includes the transformation relations necessary to account for eccentricity of the stiffening or support members or both. The finite element used for the shell is a modification of the Bogner, Fox and Schmit 48 degrees-of-freedom element. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated in the first example by comparing the stress results with the corresponding quantities computed by an analytical procedure. The structure chosen was a roof shell with edge beams in order to provide a severe test and the stresses rather than just displacements are compared in order to assess its practical value. A second example demonstrates the application of the method to a problem where flexure predominates.

AB - Two methods of including warping effects in the stiffness method of analysis are presented. Method B seems to be superior to Method A for cases where the warping constant is not large. In the limiting case where Iw=0, the warping effects disappear and leave only the familiar GIx/L. When Iw is small relative to Ix (approximately pL&gt;5 for each element) computational errors grow, because the stiffness matrix tends to become singular as the elements on the main diagonal associated with warping approach zero. This is not a serious practical problem, as good solutions can be obtained using an ordinary grid analysis neglecting warping for structures where warping stiffness is small and p is large. Composite bridges seem to fall near the borderline where warping can be neglected. The bridge used in the example above was noncomposite so that warping would be significant. Bimoment and warping torsion are obtained for grid structures. Results of computer programs based upon these methods are shown to agree closely with published solutions for straight beams, a curved beam and a curved highway bridge.

AB - The effect of soil-structure interaction on the structural response to earthquake motion is analyzed. The structure is modeled by a one degree-of-freedom system resting on an elastic half space. The soil is then approximated by simple mass-spring dashpot systems using the solutions obtained by Bycroft for the soil compliances. The resulting dynamic model is expressed by nondimensional parameters. Emphasis is put on the physical meaning of these parameters in order to obtain results that can be applied to practical design. A probabilistic, rather than a deterministic, approach is used. The input motion is first assumed a white noise process, and the maximum response is replaced by the RMS response. Subsequently a set of artificial records is usd and the average maximum response is obtained. The conclusions are that the phenomenon usually helps or is negligible in actual cases. For some special conditions, however, there can be an amplification in the structural response. This amplification is never larger than about 20%.

AB - In an ideal situation, completely safe structures can be designed if exact information is known concerning loads and strengths involved during the lifetime of these structures, and exact methods of structural analysis are available. In the real world uncertainties exist in this information as well as in the method of analysis. To account for these uncertainties, various factors of safety have been used in the design of structures. Probabilistic methods have been applied for the interpretation as well as determination of these factors of safety. Techniques in structural analysis are being refined continuously. The objective herein is to present the concept of structural control as an alternative approach to the safety problems of structural engineering. Pertinent points of the control theory are reviewed along with certain pioneering work in this direction. The practicality of this concept is illustrated with an example using analog parallel logic devices.

Significant departure is shown between the calculated results and those predicted by simplified analyses such as by membrane theory. The importance of considering beam weight is stressed. The finite elements used in the analysis are flat triangular elements for the shell and linearly tapered beam sections. The shell element has 27 degrees-of-freedom with the use of midside nodes. The beam elements have 16 degrees-of-freedom with the use of midlength nodes.

AB - A technique is presented for obtaining the elastic-plastic stress-strain distribution in axisymmetric and plane stress continuum composed of temperature dependent linear strain-hardening isotropic material. The method employs an incremental finite element computer program using the Prandtl-Reuss flow equations to derive a plastic stress-strain matrix in a manner similar to the tangent modulus method. The addition of pseudo stresses is used to develop load terms that account for changes in the material properties which occur during the increment, thus keeping the solution on the temperature dependent material stress-strain curve. The pseudo stresses also correct for any elastic over-shoot that occurs when an element changes from an elastic to a plastic state. With this technique it becomes economically feasible to perform elastic-plastic stress analyses on two-dimensional continuum subjected to transient thermal and mechanical loadings with material properties varying during multiple loading-unloading cycles.

Stiffness matrices are developed for fixed as well as movable cables, by taking into account both their flexibility and catenary action. The nonlinear analysis is performed by successive iteration of linear computations. In each step of the iterations, stiffness matrices and stability functions assembled on the basis of data determined in the previous step, are employed. The external loads applied in each iteration are obtained by subtracting the internal joint stress resultants of the previous step from the corresponding joint loads.

AB - The paper presents an engineering solution to the problem of inelastic sidesway buckling of multistory steel frames. The girders of the frame are loaded by gravity loads which cause partial yielding in the frame before the occurrence of buckling. In the solution fictitious lateral loads of small magnitude are applied to the floor levels to approximate the effect of initial between-story eccentricities. For each set of the selected lateral loads, a second-order elastic-plastic analysis is performed to determine the frame instability load. The frame buckling load is obtained as the limit of the frame instability loads when the values of the lateral loads aproach zero. Tests on two half-scale frames fabricated from wide-flange shapes were conducted, and the results show good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

AB - The elastic and inelastic behavior of uniformly loaded short, intermediate, and long reinforced concrete shell roof structures is studied with a series of small scale model shells. All shells had end diaphragms and vertical edge members on the free edges. The elastic range of behavior of the models represented only a small fraction of ultimate load capacity, and correlated well with theoretical predictions. Cracking occurred at or near the working load level, with subsequent reductions in shell stiffness; increasing loads led to failure modes varying from a beam failure in long shells, combined transverse, longitudinal, and diagonal corner cracking in intermediate length shells, and rather abrupt transverse and diagonal cracking in short shells. Ultimate load capacities ranged from about 200 to 1000 psf, increasing almost linearly with increasing radius to length ratio.

AB - Presented here is the elastic analysis of coupled shear walls based on the replacement of the connecting beams by an equivalent continuous medium. The solutions permit the direct evaluation of shears, bending movements, and deflections in coupled shear walls subjected to any loading distribution that can be satisfactorily approximated by a piecewise continuous linear distribution. The procedure for this direct evaluation is simply to superimpose a suitable combination of the solutions presented for uniform and linearly varying distribution of load, both of which may be discontinuous.
