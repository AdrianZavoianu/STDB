AB - Data are presented on the thresholds of perception of horizontal simple harmonic motion. Such data are needed in the evaluation of the designs of tall buildings with respect to the comfort of the occupants during severe storms. Measurements were made on 112 subjects in two motion simulators each of which represented an office environment. Periods of the oscillations were 5 sec, 10 sec and 15 sec. The frequency distributions of the perception thresholds among the subjects may be represented by the lognormal distribution. Period of oscillation, body movement, expectancy of building motion and body posture are found to be significant factors in the perception thresholds of horizontal periodic motion.

AB - By employing the plastic moment distribution method and gradually reducing the largest moments while maintaining equilibrium, it is possible to develop an algorithm for the computer programmed optimum plastic design of single steel frames. The method is then extended to include multistory and multibay frames by using suitable partitioning of such frames. As the full plastic moments are assumed to be the main design parameters and no other restrictions such as given in AISC Specifications are introduced, this study is concerned with an automatic method for initial design.

AB - The cable stayed bridge is a structure well suited for load balancing, that is for reduction of bending moments and displacements throughout the structure by post-tensioning the cables. The problem was approached frist from the point of view of reducing bending moments. A procedure was developed to achieve this reduction. The first step of this method consists of determining the bending moments due to a unit force applied successively along each cable of the bridge system. Next, a system of equations is written to express the condition that the sum of the bending moments due to unknown post-tensioning forces in the cables, shall be opposite in sign and equal to a fraction of the bending moment caused by the action of the dead load. By solving this system of equations, the post-tensioning forces in cables are determined. A computer program was written in FORTRAN language to carry out the computations.

AB - Existing seismic design criteria for highway structures are reviewed. Some background material relating to their origins is presented and some weaknesses are pointed out. Reference is made to design criteria used in building design and compared to that which is used for highways. Equivalent static force analyses and two types of dynamic analyses are analyzed and compared. The importance of structural detailing is emphasized. Two design examples using unusual design procedures are outlined. The first is a concrete viaduct structure which was designed for great earthquake deformations. The second is a long span cantilever truss for which a dynamic modal response analysis was employed. Concluding remarks are provided as a guide for consideration in future seismic criteria.

AB - Considerable knowledge and experience has been accumulated over recent years with the use of structural plastics in buildings, boats, and automobiles but few attempts have been made to construct bridges of reinforced plastics. Factors inhibiting the use of plastics in bridge construction include high material costs, unknown material properties and unfamiliarity with design procedures. Design examples of two 80-ft. (24.4 m) span, posttensioned structural plastic bridges for pedestrians are presented and compared with similar bridges built with steel and concrete and aluminum. Materials cost differentials are decreasing with technological advances in plastics materials, but at the present time, structural plastics are not economically competitive with concrete and metals for general-purpose bridges.

AB - Plastic methods of design for unbraced multistory frames are well developed. One of the most successful is plastic moment balancing. Following the preliminary design of a frame by moment balancing, a load-drift analysis of each story of the frame is required. The theoretical development of a plastic method of analysis suitable for determining the load-drift behavior of each story of an unbraced frame is presented. The analysis (designated the subassemblage method of analysis) is particularly applicable to the middle and lower stories of an unbraced frame where the PΔ moments become significant. It is based on the concept of sway subassemblages and uses directly the results of recent studies of restrained columns permitted to sway. In the subassemblage method of analysis a one-story assemblage is isolated from the frame. The load-drift behavior of the one-story assemblage is determined either manually using charts or by computer.

AB - Cable-stayed girder bridges offer a soothing appearance to many landscapes and are economical for bridge spans ranging from 750 ft. to about 1500 ft. They are suitable for cantilever method of construction so that navigation beneath them can remain undisturbed during the construction period. However, the engineer should pay more attention to some design problems such as stress concentrations due to cable anchorages, nonlinear stress-loading relationships, special characteristics of cables, etc.

AB - Influence surfaces and simple probability theory indicate the relative importance of various characteristics of live loads in an analysis of structural safety. The approximate loading model used by the National Bureau of Standards proves to be entirely satisfactory when the error is analyzed statistically and compared to the variation inherent in the loads themselves. Correlation between the loading on two nonadjacent columns of a multibay building arises from correlation of live loads. A statistical model describes the live loading as a function of the degree of specification of building use during the design phase. This model provides for the classification of mean, variance, and correlation in live loading as a function of use, and leads to suggestions concerning future live load surveys.

AB - The method incorporates a discrete parameter representation of cables and utilizes the Method of Imaginary Reactions to evaluate statical behavior and to determine the force-displacement characteristics of the system. The procedures presented make it possible to first evaluate statical system behavior and then to determine either its characteristic or force-motion response to a prescribed loading. Dynamic analysis can be carried out under any condition of loading or system deformation. As the basis of the dynamic method lies in the approach taken to statically analyze and compute the force-deformation characteristics of the structure, any system amenable to static analysis can be subject to dynamic analysis as well. By means of a linear transformation from the physical to a complex coordinate system, the method can accomodate the evaluation of force motion under linearly damped situations. The necessary fundamentals of the method are presented along with an illustrative example explaining its usage.

AB - The transfer of shear in cracked concrete by the mechanism of surface roughness interlock (aggregate interlock) is examined by tests in 16 large concrete specimens. The blocks were designed to simulate segments of the wall of a nuclear containment vessel carrying seismic membrane shear. Each specimen is precracked and the two halves are separated by a given crack width (0.762 mm) and held in position with four external restraint rods. Cyclic, reversing shear stress is applied for 25 to 55 cycles. For specimens with 240 sq in. (1,550 cm²) of shearing area, with a preset crack width of 0.030-in. (0.762 mm), and made with ASTM No. 467 aggregate, the amount of shear plane slip after 25 cycles of shear loading of ±τ is δ x 10−4 in./psi (7.36τ x 10−4 cm/N/cm² for 1.375-in. (3.50 cm) restraint rods (for τ±160 psi (110 N/cm²)), and δ=3.2τ x 10−4 in./psi (11.8 FGt x 10−4 cm/N/cm²) for 1-in. (2.54 cm) rods (for τ±120 psi (83 N/cm²)).

AB - The buckling loads for wide flange steel columns subject to elevated temperature are determined analytically. Buckling in both the elastic and elastic-plastic range are considered. The buckling loads are determined by solving the governing differential equation using finite differences. Various cases of nonuniform temperature along the length of the member are considered. The influence of elevated temperature on the material properties and the influence of residual stress on the buckling loads is taken into account. Results are presented in the form of column curves relating the critical stress and the column slenderness ratio for various types of boundary conditions.
