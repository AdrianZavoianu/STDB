AB - Rigid moment-resisting connections in unbraced framed structures are shown to have a significant effect on the strength and stiffness of such frames, and a method is provided whereby the size and stiffness of connections are considered in the analysis. The stiffness method of analysis is extended to consider the deformation of the connection. The elastic-plastic response of the connection subjected to antisymmetrical loading is calculated by considering the shear stiffness of the panel in the elastic range and the frame action of the boundary plates (flanges and stiffeners) in the inelastic range. Using the method described, the effect of connection shear stiffening on the frame strength and resistance to drift may be determined. In one experiment in which the girder depth-to-story height ratio was 1:8 and the column depth to girder span ratio was 1:20, the conventional method of analysis erred by 32%; whereas, the panel hinge method predicted the observed behavior accurately.

AB - A nongradient direct search procedure is presented to treat general structural optimization problems, in which the independent design variables are discrete in nature. The procedure combines the basic ideas of the complex method of Box with the pattern search of Hooke and Jeeves. Three examples of design are considered: a framed structure and a tied cantilever beam under static loads, and a two-layered slab under dynamic loads. These examples illustrate the wide variety of structural optimization problems which can be satisfactorily treated by the method.

AB - A method is developed for the analysis of noncircular cylindrical shells by simulating the Donnell-Jenkins equation on a hybrid computer. The shell is assumed to be simply supported at ends but subject to any set of boundary conditions along the edges. For a uniformly loaded shell, the governing partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations using separation of variables. These equations contain variable coefficients that are functions of slope and curvature of shell arc. The slope is first expressed as a polynomial in terms of arc length and this polynomial and the curvature then are generated on the analog computer. It was found that once the basic simulation is set up, the model can be changed rapidly to include different cross-sectional profiles. Various methods of satisfying the split-boundary conditions on the hybrid computer are described and it is shown that the semiautomatic method employed by the writers leads to rapid convergence in the present case.

AB - An analytical method is presented for predicting the strength of a corner column-slab connection in a flat plate structure subjected to bending moment or combined bending and axial load through the column stubs. It takes into account the column side to the effective slab depth ratio, r/d, concrete and steel properties, steel configuration near the column-slab interface, and the moment to shear ratio, Î³. The validity of the method was checked against the available test data and excellent correlation was obtained. Recommendations for its application and a numerical example are given.

AB - The method of indirect structural analysis by using influence lines is extended to the analysis of elastic continua plates, shells, or three dimensional solids. Effective incorporation with the finite element method is made possible by a concept similar to the Mueller-Breslau principle. The introduction of equivalent nodal forces makes it possible to find the influence surfaces for every deflection and for every internal stress in the continuum by a single inversion of the global stiffness matrix. With the influence surfaces known, critical live load positioning can then be determined to find the extreme stresses and extreme deflections. Numerical examples are given for the simply supported isotropic plate and a three-span simply supported continuous isotropic plate for accuracy and convergence check. The results are remarkably good.

AB - A summary of the state-of-the-art in the mechanics of fiber reinforced composite materials is presented. Micromechanics and macromechanics are both examined although particular emphasis is placed on concepts of lamination theory. Application of composite mechanics to the analysis of test methods for characterizing the mechanical properties of fibrous composites is also covered. Equations which represent some of the more important concepts in composite mechanics are summarized. It is shown that the state-of-the-art in the mechanics of composite materials has reached a plateau where it can be used in structural design.

AB - For routine design with reasonably regular layouts and uniform load conditions, essentially within limitations of the 1963 Code empirical method, simple approximations can result in trial dimensions often satisfactory for initial design. The writer presents a number of such short cuts and suggests others based upon a study of the computer-produced designs over the usual range of span and load, as tabulated in the 1973 CRSI Handbook. Herein a practical design approach is implicitly defined as one that does not require more design time than a consulting engineer can afford or that does not produce added value to the client beyond the cost of the design time. References to applicable sections of the 1971 ACI Code and its Commentary are given. No further references are given because the Commentary contains an up-to-date bibliography, and because few published papers deal with the problem of reducing unnecessary design time and cost.

AB - The elastic-plastic buckling of wide flange columns about minor axis is studied. The interaction curves are derived analytically in terms of a parameter, T, the ratio of the web to flange areas, and are approximated by empirical equations to facilitate the design of such columns. These curves are insensitive to the variations in T for common column sections and are, therefore, presented for an average value T = 0.29. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the method of analysis.

AB - Short term deflections of concrete flat plates are considered. Deflection results from a number of finite element analyses of flat plates are examined and used to provide empirical formulas for estimating maximum short term deflections of flat plates. Both interior and exterior panels are considered. For reinforced concrete, progressive cracking of the slab is taken into account. In the analyses, support columns have a finite size and finite flexural rigidity. Edge beams also have a finite size and finite flexural and torsional rigidities. The suggested formulas provide load-deflection curves that agree well with numerical results by others and with experimental results.

AB - An interaction criterion for prestressed concrete beams under torsion and bending is presented. Test results for 42 rectangular specimens include properties of beams, their ultimate strength, crack patterns, and torque-twist and bending-deflection curves. Substantial reduction in torsional stiffness due to torsional cracks was observed; however, the effect on bending stiffness is relatively small. Beams with stirrups and longitudinal steel have ample rotation capacity at failure. Having established three modes of failure by experimental observations for varying bending to torque ratios, a generalized skew bending theory is developed to evaluate cracking and ultimate torques. Although 150 tests by various investigators including the writers have been evaluated to check the validity of the theory, only 90 tests are given in this paper. A comparison of these values with the test results is found to be satisfactory. For prestressed beams supplemented with longitudinal steel of a minimum amount of about 1%, the nondimensional interaction curve can be conservatively taken as a square.

Equations are presented. The technique allows the analysis to be performed by standards plane frame computer programs, the appropriate stiffness transformations being carried out on the input data by the simple expedient of factoring the areas and second moments of area of the members.
