AB - Among wood's structural attributes is its inherent fine performance under shock and fatigue loadings. Thus, it is particularly valuable as a construction material in structures that may be subject to wind, earthquake, or blast loading. Surveys of natural disaster areas show that structural failures result from the inability of structures to act as a unit. Buildings that are securely tied together from foundation through roof are capable of withstanding terrific punishment. A real benefit of wood systems is that they can be easily tied together as a rigid structural unit, but are still elastic enough to undergo deformation without permanent structural damage.

AB - A hand method of analysis is presented for the torsional warping behavior of nonplanar asymmetrical systems of shear walls such as the elevator and service shafts in tall buildings. The method is suitable for both uniform and nonuniform walls with or without constraining lintels, or internal floor slabs, or both. The basic governing equations are derived, and used to construct non-dimensional curves which allow the direct analysis of uniform open-section walls subject to uniformly distributed torsional moment. The transfer matrix method is used to extend the method for the hand analysis of nonuniform wall systems. The results for uniform and nonuniform examples are shown to compare closely with those obtained by a more exact computer analysis.

AB - The three-dimensional interaction of several plane walls, open section walls, and plane frames is studied under the action of horizontal forces. Walls are taken to have infinite shear rigidity while warping effects are considered. Frames are treated as vertical cantilever beams with infinite bending moment rigidities but finite shear stiffnesses. The floor slabs are replaced by an infinite number of diaphragms with no transverse stiffness but infinite in-plane rigidity. The stiffnesses of the walls and frames are assumed constant throughout the height of the building. A system of three differential equations of the third order solves the problem in a way similar to the displacement method. The method is useful in providing a general view of the macroscopic behavior of the structure through the use of a small number of elastic parameters.

AB - The effect of ice accumulations on the stability of a special type of tall guyed communications tower is examined under conditions of light wind. The 1500-ft high tower is guyed at seven levels. The top-most level, which comprises the primary signal-transmitter, consists of 24 cables, spaced 15° apart. At all other levels, three cables are used, spaced 120° apart. Design provisions for considering ice on towers, and tower failures under icing conditions are briefly examined. The technique used to determine the ice thickness at which collapse is imminent (critical ice thickness) is described. Results of applying the approach are presented, and the effect on critical ice thickness and relative cost of making certain modifications is investigated. The modifications considered include increasing guy initial tensions, stiffening of the web and guy system, and increasing the face width of the tower shaft.

AB - An analytical method of assessing tornado risks is presented whereby the probability of a tornado striking a given point with a maximum wind speed exceeding a prescribed value can be evaluated. An illustrative example of the application of this method to structural design is given. The results indicate that in design of structures with stringent safety requirements, tornadoes present much higher risks than ordinary winds in areas with high tornado frequency. Thus under these circumstances, effects of tornadoes are really the controlling factors in wind-resistant design of structures.

AB - A common technique in geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis is to express the total potential in terms of Lagrangian displacement coordinates, differentiate the potential to obtain the equilibrium equations, and form the differentials of the equilibrium equations to obtain linear incremental equilibrium equations. The geometric nonlinearities in the strain-displacement equations give rise to incremental matrices in the preceding equations. The form of these matrices is not unique in the expression for the total potential. The paper presents expressions for incremental matrices that remain valid in the equilibrium equations and in the linear incremental equilibrium equations. The construction of such matrices is illustrated for truss elements, in-plane bending elements, membrane elements, and plate flexural elements. An examination of some of the recent literature indicates that some investigators have used inappropriate forms of these incremental matrices.

AB - A finite element formulation is presented for the stability analysis of beam columns and its application is demonstrated as a practical tool for direct use by researchers and designers. A systematic procedure, based on a displacement formulation, is developed to evaluate the geometric stiffness matrices for beam columns for large axial, lateral and torsional displacements. The finite element solutions are compared to analytical solutions for a variety of problems, e.g., columns under distributed axial loads, tapered columns, columns imbedded in an elastic medium, pretwisted columns, lateral-torsional buckling of beam columns, and space frames. In all cases, a good convergence is observed and satisfactory accuracy is obtained by using few elements. The required computational effort is found to be minimal.

AB - An iterative procedure for determining the joint positions corresponding to a minimum mass space truss is presented. Displacement constraints and nonconstant stress constraints (stability) are taken into account. The truss is presumed to carry consecutively a large number of different systems of forces. The iteration includes a sequence of linear programming problems (SLP, with move-limits), and for each of these problems only the nearby constraints are considered. Analytical expressions are given for the gradients describing the linear problems. A dome is optimized using different constraints.
