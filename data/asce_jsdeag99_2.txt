AB - A relatively simple hand method is presented for the static and dynamic analyses of uniform structures consisting of interacting shear walls and frames with effectively planar loadings and deformation. The method is applicable also to the static analyses of non-uniform shear wall-frame structures in which step changes of properties occur at several elevations in the height of the structure. Examples are given to show that the method provides results which compare closely with those obtained from more exact but lengthier methods of analysis. Design curves which further simplify the hand computation are also included.

AB - The elastic critical sum of vertical loads acting on an unbraced symmetrical frame is very nearly constant and is irrespective of the ratio of load carried by each column. Thus, in the elastic stability analysis of multistory frames, it is recommended that the variations of the axial forces in the columns produced from wind or other lateral forces be neglected. It is found that the sway buckling loads decrease materially when such deformations are included for frames having bigger number of stories. The maximum decrease in the sway buckling loads is noticed for multistory frames having constant column sections, equal beam stiffnesses, same story heights and which are loaded only at the top. As the span of the frame gets smaller with respect to the height of columns, the values of the buckling loads as obtained by multistory frame analysis are very nearly the same as those produced from battened column analysis.

AB - A general analytical procedure for predicting the behavior of reinforced concrete beams subjected to variable repeated loading which includes the effect of the strain-hardening of the steel and creep behavior of the concrete is verified with a test program consisting of eight simply supported beams and six two-span continuous beams. The instantaneous moment-curvature relationship is developed using the stress-strain relations obtained from standard axial tests for the steel and concrete to represent the stresses in each of the materials at any point in the cross section. The equations developed to represent the moment-curvature-time relationships are obtained from a flexural theory which represents the stress-strain-time relationship for the concrete by the actual experiment strain values for plain concrete cylinders at various stress and time coordinates. The intermediate stress strains are calculated by interpolating between the given points.

AB - Clay tile and wall assemblages were tested as compressive prisms with six types of tile units. Specimens were tested at eccentricity ratios of 0, 1/6, and 1/3. Wall column specimens were built in three heights for the 4-in. units (h/t=10, 20, 40) and in two heights for the 6-in. and 8-in. units (h/t=10, 20) and tested with eccentricity ratios of 0, 1/6, and 1/3. Since walls may span either vertically between floors or horizontally between walls and columns, the specimens, approximately 4 ft times 8 ft, of each unit type with the span perpendicular and with the span parallel to bed joints were tested. The shear capacity was determined from the diagonal tension test method of loading opposite corners of a square panel to cause tensile failure perpendicular to direction of load.

AB - A structure having geometry, loads, and constraints as given characteristics is considered. To represent the stress and strain distribution the actual structure is conceived as an assemblage of elements interconnected at a number of discrete corner points. External forces and constraints are transferred to these points. Such finite element discretization is considered in the present note as extended both to elastic and ultimate load analysis.

AB - This paper formulates stiffness functions for an elastically supported beam-column under the action of discrete joint loads. These functions allow a member stiffness to be formed and incorporated into a structure matrix for analysis in the usual manner. A displacement or buckling analysis can then be carried out, the only approximation being in the assumed elastic behavior of the supporting medium. The approach is applied to buckling analysis of piles, and results are compared with those derived by other methods with test results.
