AB - Approximate design equations supported prestressed composite steel beams are developed. Prestressing is achieved by welding a high strength steel cover plate on the flange of an initially stressed rolled steel beam which is released after welding. It is illustrated with the help of several design examples that significant savings in the material cost can be derived for simply supported beams of large spans by the use of prestressed composite steel beams. The proposed design method conforms to the 1969 AISC Specification for the Design, Fabrication, and Erection of Structural Steel Buildings.

AB - An iterative method for rapid convergence of nonlinear cable net problems is presented. Three already available methods, and the new method are compared for their efficiency in the convergence of highly nonlinear cable net problems. Three problems used in the comparisons indicate that as the nonlinearity increases, the new iterative method gains in comparative efficiency. For highly nonlinear cases, it is important that the linearized equations of equilibrium should be the true linear equations; otherwise, convergence may not be achieved when the Newton-Raphson procedure or any modified version of it is used for iteration.

AB - Four deck-girder highway bridges, located in an area which has since been flooded as a part of a TVA reservoir, were tested to failure under static loading. A system of rock anchors was used to develop the necessary forces. The loads were applied to a bridge span at eight load points, simulating the rear wheels of two AASHO HS trucks, one truck in each traffic lane. Load-deflection curves for each bridge are presented. All of the bridges but one failed, as expected, in a flexural mode. Composite action was lost in the prestressed concrete bridge, and the two interior girders failed in shear. All of the bridges exhibited considerable ductility, with large deflections at failure. The failure load for each bridge, achieved at the expense of large deflections, was several times the design load for the bridge.

AB - A finite element procedure for large deflection analysis of thin plates that exhibits monotonic convergence to results obtained using the von Karman plate equation is presented. A simplified method of solution is also developed that yields acceptable results with a significant reduction in computational effort. The Kirchoff thin plate assumptions are used, together with the appropriate nonlinear terms in the strain displacement equations to express the potential energy functional in terms of the displacement fields. The functional is discretized according to the usual finite element techniques and two sets of equations that essentially uncouple the in-plane and bending effects are obtained. Thus, the storage requirements of the computer program are based on a 3-degree-of-freedom per nodal point system although 5-degree-of-freedom are available to define the deformation of the idealized structure. This results in a significant reduction in storage requirements.

AB - A theory to analyze nonplanar coupled shear walls subjected to lateral loading is presented. The theory is applicable to a pair of shear walls of arbitrary cross-sectional shapes connected by a band of evenly spaced connecting members. The lateral loadings can be completely general and are not restricted to act in certain planes. The theory gives the torsional deformation in addition to the flexural deformations of the structure. A test on a Plexiglas structural modal is carried out to verify the accuracy of the theory.

AB - The load-velocity relationship for large bluff buildings subjected to dynamic wind excitation is investigated. Using experimental results for the correlation structure of turbulent wind flow, an aerodynamic load admittance function for the along-wind response is developed. For numerical evaluation, the momentum approach, proposed by Vickery and Davenport in 1966-67, is applied, and the results are compared with existing experimental data. Apparently there is good agreement. In this connection, the complexity of the flow and pressure pattern about a large building is briefly commented upon and new avenues of research are indicated. Evaluation of maximum response peaks for incorporation into a gust factor is given and the influence of the broadness of the spectrum of the response and excitation processes is studied.

AB - In the dynamic analysis of structures including the effect of foundation flexibility, the soil is often represented by a horizontal and a rocking spring and associated dashpots. Damping in the different components of this system then varies greatly both in magnitude and nature. Because of the damping terms the resulting model will not have, in general, modes in the classical sense. While a rigorous solution is possible in the frequency domain through the use of Fourier transforms, modal analysis would offer definite advantages from a practical point of view. A rule is presented to apply modal analysis in an approximate way, assigning to each mode a weighted value of damping. Results obtained by application of this rule are compared to exact solutions in the frequency domain. For many cases of interest the error is small. It is also shown that, for these problems, the usual assumption of constant modal damping is not realistic.

Both the membrane state of stress in the plane of the web bending stresses resulting from the curvature of the panel are considered. A simplified model of the web as a series of arches is developed. An approximate solution for the model based on a Rayleigh-Ritz procedure is obtained. The influence of curvature and longitudinal stiffening on the resulting stresses in curved webs is presented. Design recommendations for web depth-to-thickness ratios are established.

AB - Fifty-four large glued-laminated timber beams were designed, fabricated, and tested to failure in static bending. Designs included several levels of moduli of elasticity (MOE) and rupture (MOR). Beams were made from lumber of Southern pine, Douglas fir, hem-fir, and Lodgepole pine; they were 40 ft (12 m) long, 5 in. (13 mm) wide, and 24 in. (610 mm) deep. Individual pieces were evaluated by nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques for MOE before laminating. Results indicated several advantages for NDT methods in construction of glued-laminated beams. The lumber available can be located in the beam to gain maximum stiffness (MOE) and good strength (MOE). MOE of the beams was highly predictable; MOR was less predictable, but met the desired stress level. Based on the research, specifications have been published, which provide for the use of several additional species of lumber, nondestructively tested in glued-laminated beams.

The lower-bound collapse loads calculated for a range of coefficients of orthotropy and ratio of width to length of slab, agree closely with the upper-bound values derived from the yield line theory. Simple equations are given for moment fields, collapse loads, and edge-beam forces which are useful in the design of such slabs.

AB - Computations to obtain the ultimate strength of a biaxially loaded column are fairly involved and, at present, only numerical methods are available to obtain the best possible solutions for most cases. For practical purposes, however, these numerical approaches are often laborious. This paper presents an approximate method based on an idealized biaxial interaction equation of the cross section which leads to algebraic relations between axial force and biaxial bending moments in the ultimate state of the column, from which numerical design charts may be prepared. Numerical examples are shown for a symmetric as well as an unsymmetric loading case.

AB - A number of problems on the inelastic stability of biaxially loaded columns were solved by utilizing an incremental approach. The matrix of influence coefficients, referred to herein as the tangent stiffness matrix, varies with the loading and depends upon the penetration of yielding across the section, the magnitude of external loads, and the displacements of the column. The matrix must therefore be revised with each increment of load, and during each cycle of iteration. Successive corrections are made until the condition of equilibrium between the internal and external forces is satisfied. The analysis covered two different types of loading, proportional and nonproportional. The influences of material yielding, residual stress, end warping restraint, end bending restraint, and initial imperfection were included. The problems of centrally loaded columns and lateral-torsional buckling of beam-columns were also examined by using the biaxial bending theory and the concept of initial imperfection.

AB - Normal stresses, caused by bending of a girder in the direction of its curved web, have an effect equivalent to lateral pressure on the web. Except for pure shear, the problem of a curved web subjected to inplane membrane stresses is not a buckling but rather a deflection amplification problem. The membrane stresses cannot exceed a certain critical limit at which the deformation of the web theoretically reaches infinity. The behavior of curved webs is examined under different combination of membrane stresses using the linear theory of shells. The critical limit is calculated using two modified simultaneous homogenous differential equations and the Galerkin's method. The two differential equations lead to a system of linear homogenous equations from which the minimum eigenvalues of the critical load are calculated and presented in tables and curves. Approximate conservative formulas are also given for practical applications.

AB - This paper describes the dynamic behavior of general structural frameworks subjected to lateral time-dependent excitations and static axial loads. Different static axial loads may be applied to various members which are simultaneously subjected to lateral harmonic excitations applied as nodal forces, uniform and nonuniform loads, or foundation movements. All the matrix equations are expressed in nondimensional parameters representing various effects of rotary inertia, axial load, and shear and bending deformations. The individual parameter may be dropped when the appropriate effect is not considered. Consequently, the formulation and the computer program developed may be applied to various cases of dynamic response as bending deformation only; bending deformation and axial load; rotatory inertia, bending and shear deformations; rotatory inertia, bending and shear deformations, and axial loads; etc.

The response analysis is performed in time domain by numerically simulating the resulting wind forces. The fluctuating wind velocity field is idealized as a stationary Gaussian random process with mean zero. For wind loading and response analysis, both across-wind and along-wind directions are considered. The results are used to study the effect of mechanical and aerodynamic parameters of the systems and to compare the current formulation with the approximate treatment commonly used.

The principal variables were the ratio of column side to effective depth of the slab, r/d, the ratio of the bending moment to axial load, M/V, and the reinforcement configuration. An idealized failure mechanism is defined. Punching was found to be a secondary phenomenon following the destruction of the concrete in compression due to the combined action of flexure and shear. Analysis showed that the proposed ACI (American Concrete Institute) code method is extremely conservative and does not account for the variables considered.
