AB - The Standard Oil of Indiana building currently under construction in Chicago was designed by the joint venture of Edward Durell Stone and the Perkins and Will Corporations. It is being constructed by the Turner Construction Company with steel fabricated and erected by the American Bridge Division of the United States Steel Corporation. The building is not only one of the tallest buildings in the world, but also has the distinction of having a structural system which introduces economy in construction cost by minimizing tonnage of steel in the structural frame and at the same time minimizes steel fabrication costs by choice of structural arrangements. The structural system for the building, which is essentially square in plan, consists of a central core with 16 columns which carry only vertical load, and a system of vertical columns and horizontal spandrels made of plates in the exterior walls. As such the structure behaves as a tube under both vertical and lateral loads.

AB - The structural analysis procedures used to develop an economical design of the exterior stressed skin for the Standard Oil of Indiana building is described. Numerous studies comparing finite element and frame models were performed to determine frame member properties and applicability for a suitable minimum size model. Major members were modeled as frame members considering shear distortion, high bending rigidity within connections, eccentricities of components, and interaction with the floor slabs. A space frame model was developed consisting of 1,856 joints, 3,405 members, and 170 finite elements for large solid plates. The tailoring of a general structural computer system, STRUDL, for the economical solution of this problem is described, as are the parametric analyses of parts of the building for redesign studies. Final analysis after redesign verified satisfaction of stress, deflection, and natural frequency criteria.

AB - The structural design of the outer shell of the Standard Oil of Indiana building, consisting of columns and spandrels fabricated from wide thin steel plates, is unique for high-rise buildings. The design created unusual structural analysis and design problems which were addressed with a combined experimental-theoretical approach. Studies of three such problems were documented, namely, the stability of the columns formed of plates, with and without stiffeners; stress conditions in plates making up the column-spandrel assemblages, particularly stresses near weldments; and the stability of spandrel plates under shear and bending. All three problems were studied theoretically, using finite element techniques. In addition, the stability of the columns was studied experimentally with the aid of MIT undergraduates. The results of these studies are useful for evaluating design criteria particularly in situations not clearly covered by commonly accepted codes.

AB - Relative movements of different components in a composite structure are partially restrained by the mutual interaction of the components and therefore develop secondary stresses in the structure. Differential expansion in elastic laminates gives rise to shear and normal stresses across the interface between the layers, chiefly confined to a certain length near the free ends. These stresses can be estimated with sufficient accuracy by using the finite element technique. The relative thicknesses of the layers and their elastic properties have a great influence on the magnitude and the distribution of these interface stresses. The shear stress tends to be more concentrated to a point near the free end if the layers are equally stiff. Longitudinal stress and the curvature remain unchanged beyond the end zones and can be determined by the theory of simple bending of beams.

AB - A theoretical method of analysis is presented for the calculation of the punching load of an internal column of a flat slab structure subjected to moment and shear transfer. The analytical procedure utilizes elastic thin plate theory and takes into consideration the complex state of stress which exists in the compression zone of the slab around the column periphery. As this prediction is based on lower bound limit analysis a safer estimate than that based on yield line analysis results. A detailed description of the steps involved in the analysis is given in a flow diagram which indicates that four different modes of failure are possible. The validity of the assumptions made is checked by comparing the predicted punching loads with those obtained from tests that are reported in the literature. This method will be of value in supplementing existing empirical procedures.

AB - The destruction of property and loss of life due to the effects of tornadoes and hurricanes is a yearly worldwide problem. In the United States, property damage accounts for nearly $1 billion annually. In this paper, the emphasis has been placed on tornadoes. Based on existing data available, two maximum loading conditions were adopted to design and render a typical ranch-style, wood-frame home resistant to tornadoes. These design loadings were based on reduced core pressures, and tangential wind velocities within a tornado funnel. A system of X-cables in the roof, walls, and ceiling, and bolted connections, can stiffen and strengthen a residence to carry forces many times greater than building codes require. For the maximum loading conditions recommended, a 19% increase in the construction cost of the building was determined. For less protection, and lower additional cost, a percentage of the maximum design pressures and velocities can be used.

AB - The buckling loads for pin-ended steel columns subjected to a uniform temperature increase along the length of the member are determined. The column cross sections investigated include: rolled wide flange shapes, welded I-sections, and welded box sections. The effects of residual stress and the influence of temperature on the material properties on the buckling strength in both the elastic and inelastic range are considered. Results are presented in the form of column curves and simple formulas relating the column strength at elevated temperature to that at room temperature. Comparisons of the results obtained in the study with current design provisions are also made.

AB - An analytical study of the behavior of axially loaded steel columns subject to thermal gradients across the cross section of the member is presented. The influence of residual stress, thermal stress, and the change in material properties at elevated temperature is considered. Moment-load-curvature-temperature, M-P-ϕ-T, relationships and a numerical integration method are used to determine the deflection of the column. The results indicate that the bowing produced by the thermal gradients has a significant effect on the ultimate strength of the member.

AB - A method is presented for determining the lateral loading at which a multilevel guyed tower becomes unstable. The point in the load-displacement history at which a small increase in the applied load produces an inordinately large increase in displacements is interpreted as the point at which collapse occurs. The nonlinear algebraic equations governing the displacements of the tower are transformed into a set of nonlinear differential equations which are solved by matrix inversion and numerical integration. Instability occurs as the determinant of the stiffness matrix relating differentiated displacements approaches zero. Nonlinear effects considered include flexural contraction of the mast, continuous changes in the bending stiffness of the mast, and effects of wind on the cables. Numerical results are presented for the static stability analysis of a 1,100-ft, symmetrically loaded, three-level guyed tower. The effects of independently varying several parameters of the system, such as the moment of inertia of the mast and the pretensioning and areas of the guy cables, are demonstrated.

AB - The buckling strength of cylindrical web panels of horizontally curved girders subject to shear stress is studied analytically. A simplified mathematical model that treats the web as a simply supported curved panel reinforced by transverse stiffeners is used. The solution for this model is obtained by the Galerkin method in conjunction with the Donnell thin shell equation. Recommendations for the design requirements for an optimal transverse stiffener rigidity in terms of panel aspect ratio and curvature are established.

AB - An expression for gust response factors for tall buildings is derived using an analysis, based on first principles, of three-dimensional structures subjected to random loading. The expression permits an evaluation of the effect of the alongwind pressure correlations, with regard to which differences exist between various methods presently in use. It is found that depending on the assumptions to which they resort in order to take this effect into account, some methods overestimate, while other methods underestimate, gust factor values by as much as 15 to 30%. The expression derived offers, in addition, the potential for obtaining more economical gust factors by incorporating in their structure a more realistic model of the pressure in the wake.
