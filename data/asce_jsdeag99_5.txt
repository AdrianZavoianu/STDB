AB - A discrete strip energy method is presented for the analysis of curved box girder bridges of arbitrary cross section and various forms of curved folded plate structures simply supported at the two ends and composed of elements that may, in general, be segments of conical frustra. The method is based on harmonic analysis in the circumferential direction. The total potential energy of the structure is discretized into energy due to extension and bending and energy due to shear and twisting. The two types of circumferential strip elements are obtained by using a modified finite difference discretization in the transverse direction. The use of minimum energy principles yields two types of element matrices which are assembled to form the overall stiffness matrix of the structure following stiffness matrix procedures. Results of two examples obtained by the method are compared with available solutions.

AB - A method for analyzing the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of rigid frames with I-section members is developed. This is used to study the behavior of a symmetrical rigid-jointed fixed base portal with a central beam load and two equal column loads. The continuity conditions at the rigid beam to column joints are simplified by assuming that end warping of the I-sections is elastically restrained. The interaction between column buckling (when only the columns are loaded) and flexural-torsional buckling under the beam load only is studied, and the critical load combinations are presented as load interaction diagrams. The results of experimental investigations of two small scale portal frames with zero warping restraints at the beam to column joints are in close agreement with the theoretical predictions.

AB - Fire resistance of unprotected steel columns is examined by standard fire test and numerical analyses based on a 1,000 D F (538 D C) critical temperature for failure. It is shown that fire resistance time varies with the shape factor of column weight divided by the heated perimeter, and two simple equations for calculating the fire resistance times of unprotected steel columns are established. A practical example shows that large columns used in high-rise buildings can have fire resistance times of up to one hr. The more conservative of the two equations is recommended for use in building standards.

AB - A numerical method is developed to determine the nonlinear dynamic responses of thin, elastic, rectangular plates subjected to pulse-type uniform pressure loads. The nonlinear plate theory used in this study may be identified as the dynamic von Karman theory. The numerical method is based on finite-difference approximations of the differential equations using central difference formulations. A special form of Gaussian elimination is used to solve the system of algebraic equation resulting from the finite-difference formulation. A stability criterion is developed and checked empirically. The convergence of the solution is examined. Four sets of boundary conditions are considered. The use of the method is demonstrated by specific example problems and the results are compared with other approximate solutions.

AB - The performance of high strength bolted T-stub flange-to-column connections up to the point of failure is analyzed for all possible combinations of T-flange and bolt dimensions. It is found that in high strength bolted connections subject to tension that are designed according to the current U. S. or Japanese specifications, the bolts yield before separation, and separation loads are equal to the yield strengths of the bolts. Using these observations, a simple method of analysis is developed which gives results in accord with test data, covers the range of possible modes of behavior, and provides the basis for a useful design method. Design formulas for the use of connections of this type in plastic design are suggested.

AB - A doubly-curved quadrilateral shell element is described which uses the exact shell geometry in computing the stiffness matrix and consistent load vector. The element's degree-of-freedom may be transformed to and from three-dimensional coordinate systems, which enables it to be used in the analysis of branched and stiffened shells. The elimination of midside nodes through the assumption of linear variation of derivative degrees-of-freedom on the four sides reduces data input requirements considerably and, yet, does not detract from the element's performance. The element's convergence characteristics provide solutions to linear and nonlinear problems with a minimum number of elements.

AB - A probabilistic model of sustained live occupancy loads on buildings is presented, compared with data, and analyzed to produce equivalent uniformly distributed loads (EUDLs) for structural load effects corresponding to a specified probability of being exceeded. The model of load intensity is a linear form including building, floor, and local spatial variation. The latter term is assumed to have exponentially decaying spatial correlation. Temporal variation is assumed to occur at random times associated with changes of one or more independent occupants. Influence surfaces permit translation to structural load effects. The model is compared and fitted to data from the English Building Research Station office loads survey. Results for sustained and maximum lifetime sustained load effects are shown. Figures compare 99% EUDLs for column axial forces and beam moments versus model U. S. and Canadian building codes.

AB - The viability of cumulative fatigue damage as a design criterion for single degree-of-freedom steel seismic structures is investigated. Two ensembles of earthquake acceleration records are generated and used as excitation input in simulations involving structures having varied strength factors and periods of vibration. Strain and stress histories are obtained for the extreme fibers of critical sections of the structures. These are evaluated for cumulative fatigue damage by a model which incorporates the rain flow cycle counting method, a factor to account for the mean stress of each strain reversal and an empirical adjustment to the strain-fatigue life function to account for the sequence effect of the strain histories. Fatigue damage is found to be significant in structures having periods of vibration at the lower end of the medium period range of the design earthquake spectra. The damage may be estimated from a hysteretic energy parameter pertaining to the critical section of the frame.
