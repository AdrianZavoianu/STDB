AB - With reference to planar framed structures, a tangent stiffness matrix is derived that does not require any approximation beyond those used in the conventional beam-column theory. The matrix is given in such a form as to clearly separate the contributions of large rigid body displacements from elastic and locally nonlinear effects, and its numerical evaluation appears to be routine. Possible approximations, analogous to those used by previous investigators, are also examined.

AB - A tangent stiffness matrix is derived for the geometrically nonlinear analysis of elastic space frames, based on the assumption of small relative deformations but large rotations. The approach used does not require any approximations beyond those embodied in the conventional beam-column theory, and is accordingly believed to be highly accurate. Also, a procedure is described for a practical and unambiguous representation of large rotations in three-dimensional space.

AB - A formulation has been developed that can form the basis for elastic or inelastic analysis of thin-walled beams with local and member buckling interaction. A finite element model was developed from this formation for elastic wide-flange beam which has 11 degrees-of-freedom at each node. The model yields good results for flange local buckling. The results verify that for wide-flange sections in the elastic range, the interactive effect is normally small, and local and member buckling are initiated as relatively detached phenomenon.

AB - Analytical and experimental results for deflections, under static loading, for a general folded-plate structure have been obtained and compared. The analytical results have been obtained by using the finite element method and by considering the structure as an assembly of flat triangular elements. Three different types of displacement functions introduced by Tocher, Rawtani, and Cowper, et al have been used to investigate the rate of convergence and extent of accuracy obtained. The deflections obtained by the finite element analysis are found to compare satisfactorily with the experimental results.

AB - A finite beam column element computer program for the structural analysis of proportionally loaded plane frames is described. The load-deflection curve is followed up to frame collapse based on either nonlinear elastic, plastic-linear elastic, or plastic-nonlinear elastic behavior. The program uses the stiffness method of analysis and incorporates an iteration process which employs various extrapolation formulas to accelerate the convergence. Any combination of the following nonlinear effects may be included: member stability, member axial shortening due to curvature, change of frame geometry, plastic hinge rotation at the full plastic moment of resistance, or at the moment reduced by the member axial load, the direct axial plastic deformation associated with the rotation of a hinge and the unloading of plastic hinges.

AB - Optimum design of prestressed plates subjected to multiple load conditions is formulated as a mathematical programming problem. Design variables represent plate thickness, prestressing forces, and configuration and location of tendons. Using the method of equivalent load for analysis, all the constraints are expressed explicitly as functions of the variables. Based on a transformation of variables, the design problem for a given tendon configuration or tendon location is formulated with linear constraints. In the design for minimum plate thickness or minimum prestressing forces the objective function is transformed into a linear form and the problem is reduced to linear programming. Numerical examples demonstrate the application of this method.

AB - During a seismic disturbance structural members and their joints are subjected to cyclic excitations. These cyclic excitations may be of such great magnitude that some regions of the members and connections are forced to behave inelastically. In this manner the input energy is absorbed and dissipated. In this paper some experimental work on the effect of cyclic loadings on the behavior of large structural steel cantilevers and their connections is described, and the results are evaluated. One of the important comparisons pursued in the study is between all-welded beam-to-column connections and connections with welded flanges and bolted webs. In addition, the paper proposes a simple bilinear moment-curvature relationship for beams under cyclic loading. This relationship should prove useful in dynamic analysis of structural steel frames subjected to earthquake loadings.

AB - Two representative species are selected for experimentation-Douglas fir and Red oak. Ten circular and 10 square beams are tested. First, eight beams are loaded to a specified load within the elastic region under the following load conditions: (1) pure torsion; (2) pure bending; (3) bending and restrained torsion; and (4) bending and unrestrained torsion. Following these nondestructive tests, all 20 beams are loaded to failure under different loading conditions. The experimental results are in close agreement with the theoretical predictions. No appreciable change exists in the magnitude of normal stresses due to restrained or unrestrained torsion when compared to the normal stresses due to flexure only. Unrestrained torsion does not cause significant warping of the cross section of the beam. Analysis of test results for the 20 specimens that were loaded to destruction indicates that the ultimate moment and the ultimate torque are independent of each other. For the specimens tested, the presence of torsion does not appear to change the bending strength of a wooden beam.

AB - A method is presented for designing thick-walled, nongusseted tabular joints for static loads. The method is applicable to T-, Y-, and K-joints having branch-to-chord diameter ratios of from 0.25 to 0.75. Given the axial load in a branch, the designer can use this method to choose a chord wall thickness which satisfies static strength requirements. Conversely, given the chord wall thickness, the designer can predict the axial load in the branch which would cause the chord to fail. Comparisons are presented between predicted ultimate loads and measured ultimate loads.

AB - In this paper, expressions for rotational stiffness of polygonal and circular rings are derived and interpreted, and results are also presented graphically as design aids. A special study of the effects of warping is presented. The substantial increase in overall stiffness of the ring due to warping is evaluated and a chart is given for practical use. Two numerical examples in which evaluation of the rotational restraints of the rings are given, and the results used in the analysis of the roof girder under service loads, refer to an actual structure. A comparison made with the results of a conventional analysis which ignores the rotational restraints of the rings shows a desirable reduction of approximately 10% in the moments, rotations, and deflection of the girder. In addition, it is shown that an elastic redistribution of moments occurs in the ring beams as a result of rotation of the supporting radial girders.

AB - The cyclic yielding of steel girders in a frame is investigated experimentally. Three sets of frames are subjected to static as well as dynamic cyclic horizontal loading at rates varying from 0.1 cycle/sec. to 3/4 cycle/sec. The first set, free of vertical loads, is forced horizontally into a sinusoidal type motion. The second set is loaded vertically at the beam third points and forced horizontally in a manner similar to the first set. The last set, in addition to vertical load, is forced into a horizontal time deformation similar to that generated by an earthquake. It is concluded that the rate of loading, for the previously mentioned rates, seems to have no significant influence on the response of the frames under all cases of loading.

AB - A semi-iterative technique employing finite differences is used to obtain a numerical solution for displacements, tractions, stresses, and strains of prestressed folded plate structures. General differential elasticity equations along with differential plate equations involving the three displacements, u, v, and w, and the traction Mx, are written as four second-order equations. This technique allows the use of a tridiagonal matrix routine for the solution of the resulting difference equations. The computer program written for the solution of the formulated equation handles both draped cables and straight tendons. To substantiate the analytical solution, experimental results from two epoxy models are compared with the values predicted by the theory presented.

AB - It has been observed that flat roofs may fail due to ponding loads during rain storms. Since the load due to the weight of the ponded rain water increases as the deflection of the roof increases, roof structures without sufficient rigidity may be unstable and deflect progressively and finally collapse during a sustained rain storm.
