AB - The use of steel poles to support overhead transmission lines of voltages 345 kV and higher is relatively new. This has resulted in a review of existing design and fabrication processes. This paper examines some of the problems that have occurred involving design technology, material defects, fabrication, including cold forming, welding, and galvanizing. Emphasis is placed on the need for a quality control program in the fabricating shop. Embrittlement and its causes are analyzed. Guidelines for performing a full scale proof test on the pole are presented. Field construction of poles and foundations are also considered.

AB - The problem of the static analysis of simple supported, fan-shaped, multibeam bridges is reformulated by the Fourier's series method for the purpose of introducing certain new features. Poisson's ratio is retained as a problem parameter. A procedure is devised to accelerate the convergence of bending moments in beams located directly under concentrated loads. A method is developed for the determination of influence surfaces for various effects at a specified section of a specified beam.

AB - A finite beam-column element which can be used to model the behavior of reinforced concrete members near failure is developed. The derivation of the material properties and a stiffness matrix for the element are presented. Inelastic material properties are characterized by the rigidity of a cross section whose steel could strain harden, and be unsymmetrically placed. The element stiffness matrix includes nonlinear softening due to initial forces and nonlinear changes in geometry due to rotation of the element. Inclusion of each of these parameters is necessary in order for the element to be used to adequately study the inelastic interaction of entire frames near limit loads.

AB - Modern timber structures frequently employ large wood beams bridged by 2 in. wood decking. Economy of material dictates the use of deep narrow beams whose design is limited by considerations of lateral instability. Such constructions must rely upon the in-plane shear rigidity of the attached deck to prevent collapse, yet when decks of low rigidity such as 2 in. decks are employed, the stability of the resulting structure is seriously in question. This report quantitatively answers the question of how much shear rigidity a deck must possess in order to provide adequate lateral support when attached to the top of a set of deep beams. A variational method of derivation is employed, and buckling curves are presented for five cases of load and support. The use of these results by structural engineers will facilitate the safe design of lightweight economical wood structures.

An expression for the ultimate torsional strength is proposed and compared with the test results of this investigation. As a further check the proposed ultimate strength expression is compared with all tests reported previously along with two other expressions proposed earlier by other investigators. It is shown that the expression proposed herein gives the best correlation with the test results.

AB - Engineering organizations have become increasingly concerned with the relationship of computer costs to the organization's overall pricing policies. A survey of 300 engineering organizations was undertaken to determine what computer pricing policies are currently used by the profession. The survey indicated that there is a wide variation in existing computer pricing policies. While some firms are receiving no reimbursement, other firms are charging clients for direct costs, overhead, and profit. Many intermediate situations exist between these two extremes. Over 90% of all organizations have based their computer charges on the amount of machine time used for a particular project. This approach appears questionable, since the cost of machine time is often a poor indicator of the actual costs. Mechanisms for dealing with software development costs differ significantly between firms, and firms with identical computer equipment charge very different rates for machine time. The ASCE guidelines on computer pricing contain contradictory statements and raise many unanswered questions.

AB - Model tests were successfully utilized to obtain information on the behavior, modes of failure, and load-carrying capacity of single span rectangular steel box girders. This study, which involved the testing of two slender-web steel model box girders under different combinations of bending, shear, and torsion, provides insight into the post-buckling behavior of such members. The test specimens were designed to simulate box girder bridge members having a concrete or orthotropic steel deck. When subjected to only shear and bending, the specimen exhibited a behavior quite like that of slender-web plate girders under similar loading conditions. The addition of torsion had a significant effect on the behavior of the specimens. For all conditions of loading the specimens displayed definite stress redistribution capabilities and considerable post-buckling strength. Failure modes were characterized by tension field yielding of the webs and out-of-plane deformations of the flanges.

The results of tests on nine laterally loaded beam columns of CSA G40.12 steel are reported herein. The restraint conditions, loading schemes, and slenderness ratios of the members were varied to include a wide range of structural arrangements. All tests were continued until substantial unloading had occurred due to instability. The experimental results are compared with a second-order elastic-plastic analysis.

AB - Although the problem of large concentrated forces acting over limited areas occurs in almost all phases of concrete construction, only limited experimental results are available on the ultimate bearing capacity of concrete and the various factors affecting it. The well-known cube root formula for local pressure, as recommended in various codes of practices, is based on a limited number of tests on sandstone cubes by Bauschinger. Because of the overall complexity of the problem and the difficulty of arriving at an accurate theoretical solution, experimental studies are imperative. In the present report tests concerning the geometrical variations, i.e., relative dimensions and shape of loaded area—strip, rectangular, and square, height of specimen and eccentricity of loading—uniaxial and biaxial are presented. Based on extensive tests, equations and diagrams are obtained for deriving the local bearing strength of concrete in terms of the cube compressive strength of concrete.

The incremental-variable elasticity analysis technique is used to obtain the load deflection curve for any general plate or shell. The need for a shear retention factor to provide the torsional and shear stiffness for cracked concrete is examined. The failure of the constitutive relations for a layered material to uncouple and the resulting importance of the inplane degrees-of-freedom is also considered. Finally, some numerical examples, both plates and shells, are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the incremental analysis.

AB - Most problems in structural analysis require at some stage the solution of linear equations which may require considerable execution times even on today's computers. This paper is a state-of-the-art review of research efforts directed towards computer algorithms to solve large equation systems accurately and economically. Many different solution techniques are analyzed, with emphasis on the physical interpretation of the various strategies. First, the standard Gauss algorithm is reviewed, followed by a consideration of modifications due to symmetry, the Cholesky algorithm, and a physical interpretation of the reduction process. Particular attention is given to specialized direct solution techniques of more recent data, such as various band solutions, partitioning methods (static condensation, substructuring), and frontal solutions. A short summary of iterative methods concludes this paper.

AB - This paper describes Maillart's controversial analysis for the elegant thin concrete arches he designed from 1924 to 1934. Starting from a clear understanding of structural behavior, Maillart designed these arches so that almost all the live-loading bending would be taken by the stiff deck, thus leaving the thin arch to carry little more than axial compression. The validity of his simplified analysis is confirmed by comparing his results to those from a modern computer analysis. By emphasizing design thinking instead of analytic refinement, Maillart achieved works of art in structural engineering. His approach is then contrasted to American arch studies during the same decade (1924–1934) to show how American emphasis on analytic refinement seems to have narrowed the vision of design possibilities. As late as 1972 Maillart's design ideas seem still do not to be clearly understood.

AB - A structural design code works as a mapping of structural data (gross dimensions and layout) into member proportions. A cost of code is defined by assigning a total expected cost functional to the mappings considering all the structures to be designed using the code. Code optimization is formulated as a minimization of this scalar point function (i.e., total expected cost) and is shown to be reducible to a problem in nonlinear programming.

AB - Four curved composite beams, each consisting of a steel beam with a reinforced concrete slab, were fabricated and tested. The tests were limited to single girders on a simple span. The concrete slab was attached to the top flange of the steel girders using 1/2-in. (12.7 mm) diam stud shear connectors. The main variables in the test program were the girder size, radius of curvature, loading, and the number of connectors at a section. All four beams were loaded to failure and the vertical deflection, strain, rotation, and slip (between the steel and concrete) were recorded at several locations along the length of the span. Two of the beams failed in torsion near the supports and two failed in combined bending and torsion near midspan. Observations concerning the agreement between theory and experiment are presented for the loads causing failure, and stresses and deflections at one-half the failure loads. The significance of the test results regarding the design of the shear connection is examined and a simplified method of design of headed shear connectors is presented.

Both the strength level and the magnitude of the stress are important factors in both fracture mechanisms. Galvanized A-490 bolts heat treated to within specification strength level did exhibit some susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in both laboratory and natural environments. Black A-490 bolts, on the other hand, can be properly fabricated to eliminate problems from hydrogen-stress cracking and stress-corrosion cracking.

This model is then used in defining equation of a vibration system to describe the physical parameters of the material that restrains the end of a beam. The response of the beam assembly to free and forced vibration is presented in graph form along with the major points of the analysis.

AB - A new precast concrete wind bracing in high-rise steel structures, called the Shear Field Panel system is presented. The economy of various types of wind bracing methods in tall buildings is reviewed and it is shown that the use of these panels will result in substantial savings, when used not only as bracing elements but also as permanent partitions, or, more frequently, as exterior spandrel panels. These elements connected to columns and spandrel beams resist wind forces primarily by a shear field: since deflection is controlled by the shear rigidity of the concrete, the reinforcing operates at normal stress levels instead of the lower stresses used in structural steel bracing elements. The use of these panels also eliminates the requirements for moment connections. Methods of design and analysis are presented. Numerical results and typical details are shown, and experimental work is examined.

AB - Considerable attention has been given in recent years to the dynamic performance of structural elements. The dependence of fatigue strength on stress range is well known. Test results on welded plate girders indicate a correlation between tensile fatigue strength and web boundary stress, which in turn is a function of several variables, such as frequency, nature of dynamic load, and girder proportions. This note presents an approximate analysis of the dynamics of a built-up girder, based on the realization.

AB - A new formula is developed to determine the plate thickness of stiffened light gage members. Based on the concept that intermediate stiffeners transform the plate into an orthtropic plate, this new formula is more rational and provides better approximation of the post-buckling range. This is especially true if the stiffeners are attached to the sheets rather than formed by corrugation of the sheet.

AB - The plates that will be analyzed herein have their fibers stressed either in tension on compression in each face of the plate, and it is assumed that the matrix material of the plate has no inherent strength except in shear. The problem analyzed in this paper concerns the optimal fiber layout in a corner of a fiber reinforced plate supported by two simply supporting edges meeting at an angle 20 &gt; 90°. It would appear that there are two distinct possibilities for the optimal fiber layout in the corner, depending on the assumptions made, and the interpretation of the boundary conditions. An attempt is made in this note to study the implications of these alternatives.

AB - Considerations of flexural-torsional instability usually govern the design of laterally unsupported I beams. Numerous solutions for the elastic buckling of bisymmetrical I-sections under various loading and support conditions are currently available together with several extensions to cover inelastic behavior. Monosymmetric beams, however, have received far less attention, and to date, no solutions covering inelastic behavior have been published. Thus, the treatment of this topic in design codes tends to be somewhat intuitive. This note presents theoretical solutions for one aspect of the problem (simply supported, initially stress-free beams loaded by uniform moment) together with a method of analysis capable of extension to other cases.

AB - The problem of column instability due to axial compressive loading is treated frequently. For most simple cases an exact analytical solution is possible. However, a column with in-span conditions, such as varying axial forces, changing cross-sectional properties, multiple supports, or foundations, is quite complex and requires a numerical technique. A common approach, especially for computer programs available commercially, employs tranfer matrices. This is inefficient because repetitive analyses of the beam are required in the eigenvalue search, and it is difficult to automate since root estimates are necessary. This note suggests using a modeling scheme with the axial force as the discretized parameter. This is particularly convenient since experience is so great with the similar approach of lumping the masses (Myklestadt method) of vibrating members. It is shown that use of the lumped parameter model in a transfer matrix analysis leads to an efficient computational technique that requires neither root estimates nor repetitive member analyses. Although the beams are considered in depth, the technique can be extended to other members, such as plates and symmetric shells of revolution. These members can have arbitrary changes in geometry, axial load distribution, and in-span occurrences such as supports or foundations.

AB - To be able to meet the extraordinary design specification that the roof of an airplane hangar, severely damaged by an explosion must not collapse for the load case of dead weight plus snow, the post-buckled strength of a large space truss has to be determined. The initial stress method has been applied successively to determine the post-buckled strength of a truss. The roof construction designed for standard loads using allowable stresses (buckling and fatigue) following the Swiss Codes is shown to stand up under the two extraordinary cases of catastrophe without any reinforcement.

AB - The lateral-torsional buckling strength of beam columns in both the elastic and the inelastic ranges is compared for (1) the influence of the residual stress patterns which are idealized for as-rolled and as-welded flange sections, and (2) the effect of the deterioriation in the St. Venant stiffness as a result of yielding. In this note, the cross-sectional properties in the inelastic range are numerically calculated by dividing the cross section into finite elements for given bending moment under an axial thrust. Additionally, the lateral-torsional buckling strength is calculated by the finite difference method applying the cross-sectional properties numerically obtained for the moment along the length of a beam-column. The numerical results are shown in several examples.
