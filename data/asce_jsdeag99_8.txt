AB - A theory is presented to determine the moment-curvature characteristics of prestressed concrete sections with bonded tendons subjected to axial load and reversed cycles of bending moment. The analysis is based on expressions for the stress-strain relationships of concrete and prestressing steel under cyclic loading. Provision is included to allow for varying degrees of confinement of the concrete by transverse reinforcement. An idealization is also presented to represent the moment-curvature characteristics of prestressed concrete members under cyclic loading of large amplitude for use in the dynamic analyses of framed structures subject to seismic motions. Both the theory and the idealization are compared with experimental moment-curvature curves for beam and column sections subjected to high intensity cyclic loading. Good correlation is found between theory and experiment. It is shown that substantial ductility can be available from prestressed concrete members but that energy dissipation may not be significant until crushing of the concrete has commenced.

AB - An elasto-plastic procedure for analysis of coupled shear walls by assuming a partial or complete collapse mechanism is presented. The complete collapse mechanism is assumed to occur when plastic hinges are formed at the supports of the coupling beams over the whole height of the wall and at the base of the walls, while the rotational ductility factory at coupling beam support has not yet been reached. The partial collapse mechanism is assumed to occur when the rotational ductility factor is reached before plastification of coupling beam ends has extended over the whole height. For solution, the continuum approach for analysis of coupled shear walls was applied. For practical applications, charts are presented for evaluation of various design parameters as functions of structure parameter by assuming an upper triangle load pattern, frequently used to simulate dynamic effects of earthquake motions.

AB - An analytical model which will predict the full-range behavior of reinforced concrete beams and frames has been developed. The numerical solution is accomplished using existing stiffness methods of analysis modified to suit reinforced concrete behavior. The only necessary material properties are the concrete compressive strength and steel yield strength. The model serves as an adjustable analytic prototype to which actual large- and small-scale structures tested at Princeton and elsewhere have been compared. In general, agreement is good with successive concrete cracking, moment distribution, and hinge formation illustrated. The validity of very small-scale microconcrete models as an alternative to full-scale model tests and analytic analysis is also demonstrated.

AB - The theory of vibration of homogeneous, isotropic plates is well developed. For concrete slabs, however, accurately predicting vibrational characteristics is difficult because of uncertainty as to material properties and the degree of cracking that will occur. In addition, the idealized boundary conditions are seldom realized in practice. Because of the difficulty in accurately predicting the natural frequencies of concrete structural elements, there was a need for a simple, yet accurate, method for experimentally determining dynamic responses. The testing apparatus described in this note was assembled to satisfy that need. This note examines the testing apparatus for determining the natural frequencies of stiff structural components. Its advantages include simplicity and ready availability of the test components. Data can be obtained quickly and inexpensively, yet with accuracy. The method has been used for about 2 yr for various applications (floor systems and column support systems for heavy machinery). Results have been entirely satisfactory.
