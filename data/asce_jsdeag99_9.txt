AB - The bridge type studied consisted basically of a reinforced concrete cast-in-place slab constructed to act compositely with precast prestressed concrete spread box beams. Pilot tests were conducted on a Plexiglas model simulating an existing bridge which had been previously tested as part of a series of field tests. With the model system used, dismountable Plexiglas models of a great variety of cross sections were assembled, tested, and analyzed at an average rate of four models per week. The tests were designed and conducted such that the experimental data could be subjected to a proper statistical analysis. In addition, due to the use of identical increments of load, a procedure was devised to permit the automatic correction of random errors. The various effects of beam size, number of beams, slab thickness, and presence of curb, parapet, and diaphragms are presented as a sample of the results from the testing of 26 models.

AB - The paper outlines a general procedure to estimate the wind dynamic stresses in hyperbolic cooling towers on the basis of a statistical dynamic approach. Using wind tunnel measurements of pressure fluctuations and assuming that resonance is negligible, predicted wind stresses agreed with measured stresses on an aeroelastic model. It is shown that wind coupling responses reside essentially in the first, second, and third circumferential harmonic modes and that (138 m) 451 feet between modes is important. The procedure is applied to (138-m) 451-ft tower, fixed or on columns. Results show that static and dynamic stresses are of the same order of magnitude.

AB - Exact solutions are found for rationally based mathematical models for rectangular grids with simple end supports and flexible side supports. The solutions are valid for general loadings and are in the form of double finite Fourier series. An exact micro discrete field approach is used. The mathematical model is a partial difference equation for the unknown nodal moments and deflections. Solutions are given for nonprismatic membered, regular grids in which the identical boundary stringers are: (1) different from interior stringers; and (2) identical to interior stringers.

AB - The approximate methods for prediction of structural effects of creep, such as the effective modulus (EMM), age-adjusted effective modulus (AEMM), rate of creep (RCM), rate of flow (RFM), and Levi's and Arutyunian's methods are all linear and satisfy the principle of superposition. Predictions of the approximate methods are compared with the exact numerical solutions based on the principle of superposition and given (undistorted) realistic unit creep curves. It is found that AEMM is in general superior to all other methods and along with EMM is also the simplest one. RFM (with effective modulus treatment of delayed elastic strain) appears as second best and should be resorted to when the table of aging coefficient required by AEMM is unavailable.

The probabilities of failure are computed for 25 columns subjected to design loads as well as certain earthquake excitations. Results indicate that the vertical earthquake excitation of earthquake motions should not be ignored in the seismic design of building structures.

The importance of risk and uncertainty considerations in structural evaluation and design are emphasized, and practical methods for risk assessment in terms of failure probability and for development of reliability-based design criteria are described and developed. Advocates the systematic analysis of uncertainty through first-order statistical analysis, and the explicit use of failure (or survival) probability as measure of risk and safety, to fully realize the potentials of probability theory in structural evaluation and design.

AB - The mathematical model of the tower, with the flexibility coefficients derived by assuming an idealized space truss and with masses between midheights of panels being concentrated at the panel points, is reasonable and adequate. The assumptions of uncoupled motions in the orthogonal horizontal directions and a rigid foundation are valid for the mathematical model of the tower on the basis of experimental data. Previous studies showed that three modes are adequate for dynamic analysis of free-standing towers. For free-standing structures such as the tower used for this study, the fundamental mode of vibration predominates. Experimentally determined natural periods of vibration compare very favorably with the predicted values for both horizontal directions. The structure has a fairly low damping ratio for the fundamental mode of vibration.

AB - A procedure is suggested for the ultimate design of circular concrete columns containing symmetrical steel. Steel sections and longitudinal bars enclosed with helical reinforcement. The dimensions of all the wide flange column sections listed in the United States steel handbook and all the universal column sections listed in the Australian steel handbook were averaged to produce an idealized nondimensionalized column steel section based on the nominal flange width. This column section was then considered in conjunction with either small or large proportions of longitudinal reinforcement to produce two composite column sections. One typical ultimate strength design chart is included as an example for the rapid proportioning of such composite columns. Copies of two complete sets of these charts are available from the ASCE Editor of Technical Publications. Comparison graphs showing the effect of large variation of the more important variables and design parameters indicate only small effect on ultimate strength.

AB - In the present work, the consistent mass matrix of a component beam of a three-dimensional frame is presented. The frequencies of the example shown are calculated with the consistent mass matrix and compared with the results obtained with the two previous methods. The present analysis shows the superiority of the consistent model over the discrete for the calculation of the natural frequencies of three-dimensional frames. The basis for comparison has been the balance between accuracy and number of degrees-of-freedom. The only advantage of the discrete model is that the mass matrix M is diagonal.

AB - The deflectional behavior and ultimate load capacity of orthogonal cable networks bounded by edge cables has been investigated. The results show that the ultimate load capacity of the network is substantially affected by the properties of the edge cables, despite the fact that failure occurs in the orthogonal network portion. Paradoxically, an increase in edge cable stiffness, either by increasing the cable area or the cable sag, results in a decrease in the ultimate load carrying capacity. For particular cases, this may even result in less ultimate load than that of an equivalent network with rigid boundaries. This phenomenon can be explained by analyzing the horizontal inward or outward movement of the supporting edge cables.

AB - The present AISC Specification formula is shown to be conservative for grades of steel to 100 ksi yield stress. It does not permit consideration of any load carrying capacity in the region of sections with column web depth-to-thickness ratios greater than 189 divided by the square root of σy. The objective of this paper is to develop a method of determining ultimate loads for this condition. A simulation test was conducted that involved the placing of a short length of column horizontally between loading platens of a testing machine. The machine was then compressed at the top and bottom faces of the column. A bar was tack-welded to the column flange to simulate a beam flange framing into it at that point. The deflection in the direction of the applied load and the lateral deflection were monitored. The lateral deflection indicated the stability of the column web. Test results and theoretical predictions are presented.
