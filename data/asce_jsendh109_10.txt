AB - A theoretical analysis for a horizontally framed miter‐type lock gate structure under hydrostatic pressure is presented. A set of nonlinear equations for failure modes of mitered gates is derived by the variational method incorporated with Lagrange multiplier to account for a constraint condition. The unique solution on the load‐deflection curves indicates that there is no other type of buckling mode than snap‐through when the mitered angle is very large. For mitered angle not so large, the failure mode is governed by the flexural yield stress at the center of the gate girder. The result is compared with AISC beamcolumn formula upon which the current design is based. Good agreement is reached if the failure mode is governed by the maximum flexural stress, and thus the beam‐column treatment is justified for practical purposes. Forces in such case can be directly obtained by equilibrium method, and deformation effect can be neglected. For very large angle, however, snap‐through buckling may control the capacity, and the deformation effect considerably reduces the capacity.

AB - When large cooling towers are placed directly on moderately soft soils or on long piles, the foundation flexibility has a marked influence on tower behavior. Early studies showed that axisymmetric vertical flexibility of the foundations would reduce the capacity of the tower to carry wind loads by the meridional membrane stresses so that the shell would then develop substantial circumferential bending moments over the entire height of the tower. The present paper extends these studies to include nonaxisymmetric foundation stiffness which can arise frequently in practical cases. The method of analysis given here uses a set of soil‐structure interactive equations derived from the principle of virtual work. Displacements and forces are developed by harmonic analysis and the results give the influence of a nonuniform foundation stiffness on the tower behavior. Numerical studies of two typical tower configurations show that, for gravity load it is the variation of foundation stiffness that influences design, while for wind load it is the average uniform foundation stiffness that governs. The method can be used for any axisymmetrical structure.

AB - The role of secondary moments and amount of stress redistribution at various stages of loading up to the collapse of continuous prestressed concrete beams is investigated. The related questions arising from contradictory experimental evidence and standard recommendations are examined within the context of the usual engineering assumptions accepted by the American and European Codes of practice. Both direct and incremental techniques are used for the analysis of the hyperstatic response at specified levels beyond the elastic limit, and throughout the entire loading history. A continuous beam with three unequal spans and three potential plastic hinges is used to develop the theoretical concepts and to illustrate their practical application.

AB - Adaptive finite element technology has the potential for reducing the cost of structural analysis significantly. There are two different approaches to improve upon the solution accuracy: (1) By selective mesh refinement with low order elements (the h‐version of the finite element method); and (2) through the addition of progressively higher order hierarchic shape functions (the p‐version of the finite element method). Adaptivity based on the p‐version is the most promising approach because the p‐version offers greater efficiency than the h‐version. Full utilization of the adaptive process in stress analysis requires that local a posteriori error estimates be developed in norms other than energy norms.

AB - Analytical and experimental investigations into the transient thermal behavior of continuous composite steel beam‐reinforced concrete slab highway bridges are reported. Temperatures and deformations were measured during transient cooling of a 0.354 scale model of a three‐span continuous bridge. The model bridge was 53 ft 1‐1/4 in. (16.2 m) long. Slab dimensions were 10 ft 6‐3/4 in. (3.2 m) wide by 2‐7/16 in. (62 mm) thick. It was supported on four W10×15(W254×6.8) continuous steel beams. A numerical procedure is presented for the solution of transient temperatures in composite slab‐steel beam highway bridges. The two‐dimensional finite element analysis predict the temperature distributions of the cross section to ±0.5°F(±0.3°C). A linear temperature rectangular finite element is used. Statistical analyses indicate a better than 0.99 probability of correlation between the predicted and measured temperatures. The temperature history of the model bridge requires 462 time steps of 10 seconds each to cover the total cooling period. A finite element thermoelastic analysis is used to compute strains, stresses and deflections. The method is applicable to other systems of composite construction.

AB - Structural optimization is examined from the viewpoint of structural design office practice. The costs and benefits of optimization are considered, as are the special requirements which practical design processes impose. Several design aid computer applications which use optimization methods are examined including simple structural element design, whole structure configuration and sizing for trusses and frames and some specialist applications for concrete bridge decks and small industrial buildings. Practical considerations such as the discreteness of the variables and the use of design aid programs within iterative design processes are considered. Appropriate optimization methods are suggested for each group of applications, emphasis in choice of method being placed upon the practicality of the resulting design. It is concluded that optimum design aid programs are now practicable for many design offices, speeding up the design time for a project and thus repaying capital and software costs. The writing of appropriate software is a vital element at present receiving too little attention.

AB - Several numerical results for the load carrying capacity of two‐hinged, parabolic, steel arch bridge structures—determined by an accurate finite element approach—are presented. The arch structures are composed of two main ribs connected by a lateral bracing system. The load combination that is considered consists of vertical loading and practical lateral loading to which bridge structures are actually subjected. From the numerical results, the influence of several parameters on the strength of arch structures is discussed. It is concluded that the load carrying capacity of arch bridge structures with conventional out‐of‐plane rigidities, under vertical and practical lateral loading, may be determined by a simpler, quasi‐planar structural analysis.

AB - The purpose of the investigation presented herein is to study the behavior of proposed nonprismatic folded plates. The laboratory test program consisted of tests on two sand‐araldite models of variable depth folded plates of a single unit of inverted trough section each with a 1 m span. The proposed nonprismatic shape is obtained by varying the depth of the folded plate parabolically along the span with maximum depth at mid span. The ratios of mid span depth to the depth at support for the two models were 2 and 4. The experiment was conducted for three loading conditions: (1) Uniformly distributed load on top plate and line load along both valleys; (2) uniformly distributed load on top plate; and (3) uniformly distributed load on top plate and line load along one of the valleys. The deflections, longitudinal stresses, and transverse moments predicted by the force method of analysis are compared with those obtained from the experiment and are found to be in good agreement.
