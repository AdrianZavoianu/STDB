AB - The problem of ponding instability of inflated imperfect cylinderical membranes is considered. It is shown that the existence of a small depression which allows the start of ponding of a fluid may lead to instability and complete collapse of the inflated structure. Several cases where the initial depression is of uniform, triangular, sinusoidal or smooth sinusoidal shape are considered and the equations of limiting equilibrium are solved. The magnitudes of the critical initial depression depths for onset of collapse are obtained and their dependences on membrane and depression geometries, and internal pressure are studied. The results are presented in graphical form. The reinterpretations of the stability criteria in terms of an inflated perfectly cylindrical membrane subjected to distributed overloads are also briefly examined.

AB - Nonsway columns with initial crookedness and residual stresses, and partially restrained by linear, elastic‐plastic, or nonlinear end restraints are studied in the inelastic range. An algorithm based on an iterative tangent stiffness approach coupled with a finite‐difference equilibrium method is developed relative to the minor axis of the column cross section. The effect of end restraint on the response of imperfect columns is explained. The influence of imperfections on the behavior of partially restrained columns is identified by means of stiffness degradation curves. Finally, new design expressions are proposed for evaluating steel column strength which make use of a “plastic effective length factor” and the use of the proposed procedure illustrated by means of a design example.

AB - Charts are presented for the seismic design of uniform fixed‐base coupled shear wall buildings by the response spectrum method using the first two modes. The building is treated as a continuum and its actual mode shapes are utilized for evaluating the various modal responses; namely, the top deflection, the shear force and moments in the walls, and the shear force in the connecting medium. The distributions of the moments and shears along the height are also presented, thus permitting the curtailment of reinforcements where appropriate. The results are given for practical values of the two nondimensional parameters which between them incorporate all the geometric and material properties of the system. The use of the design charts is demonstrated through the example of a 26‐story building. The comparison with available approximate results based on the mode shapes of a slender cantilever shows small differences for the RSS response. However large ones occurred for the response in the second mode. Thus, for relatively tall buildings, where the contribution of the second mode predominates, the approximate method may prove inadequate.

AB - This paper presents a theoretical study of glue laminated lumber diaphragms. All glue lines are made up of elastomeric adhesives having stiffnesses of 90 psi‐900 psi. The use of such adhesives provides an incomplete partial composite. Three parameters which influence the behavior of diaphragms are studies. These include the stiffness of glue lines, the number of courses, and properties of the decking. Analytical results show that a large number of layers produces flexible diaphragms. It is also shown that gluing a few of the courses along the outer edges of the diaphragm may be sufficient to provide the proper strength and serviceability. In addition, the use of higher grade wood for the outer layers provides economical means of obtaining the strength required.

AB - A statistical investigation on geometrical imperfections and fabrication tolerances of plate elements as well as the reducing effect on their ultimate strength in steel girder bridges fabricated in Japan are described. Measured imperfections are misalignments and angular changes of butt‐welded plate elements, such as outstanding compression flanges of plate girder and composite I‐girder bridges, as well as plate panels between stiffeners of stiffened compression plates and longitudinal stiffeners in steel box girders. The finite element method based on the elasto‐plastic finite displacement theory is applied to precise estimation of the ultimate strength of plate elements. Both the imperfections and the ultimate strength are described in semiprobabilistic terms by fitting Weibull distribution and gamma distribution functions.

AB - This paper summarizes the reduced ultimate strength of the compression flange of plate girders containing initial deflection. The major findings are as follows: There is no interrelation between the maximum initial deflection and plate dimension such as width, thickness or width‐thickness ratio of the flange. The slenderness parameter of plate, R, a function of the widththickness ratio, and the aspect ratio, are the two factors reducing the ultimate strength. The ultimate strength is minimum with the aspect ratio in the range of 2 to 3. However, the reducing effect does not increase when the aspect ratio is beyond 3. Among the three initial deflection modes—plate bending, cylindrical bending and simple twisting, the simple twisting has the least effect. R=0.9 is the most sensitive value to the initial deflection in reducing the ultimate strength. A procedure has been established to obtain expected and theoretical ultimate strength by a probability density function through Weibull distribution or Gamma distribution.

AB - This paper presents a statistical study on the actual imperfections and their relations to the strength of webplates and their stiffeners of bridge superstructures. The field measurements, data acquisition, and processing were undertaken by a special task committee of the Society of Steel Construction of Japan from 1977–1978. The measurements were performed during the temporary assembly of the structures at workshops, where several panels were subjected to the survey such as those at the central and quarter span points for simply supported bridges, and furthermore, at the intermediate supports for continuously supported bridges. Through statistical analyses, and fractiles, the probabilities of exceedance and nonexceedance of the imperfections and the strengths, respectively, are evaluated.

AB - The elastic and inelastic buckling of cruciform section columns formed from four equal leg angles is examined. The elastic critical loads for flexural, torsional and plate building are determined. Two different and extreme assumptions are made about the residual stress distribution from which the tangent and reduced modulus buckling loads are determined for the elastic core of the section. The results of this analysis are compared with empirical methods in current specification and indicate that the specifications are not conservative for all values of slenderness and width‐thickness ratios.

The interaction effect of simultaneously acting lateral load and axial load is also investigated. The analytical results are compared with the predictions of an elasto‐plastic finite element program including large displacement effects. It is demonstrated that simple rigid‐plastic methods represent a useful tool for ultimate load analysis of bracing elements in offshore platforms.

AB - A methodology for the prediction of tornado wind probabilities has been developed for site‐ and structure‐specific wind loading risk assessments. The inputs to the model include local tornado occurrence data and the structure plan, orientation, height, and design life. The wind‐risk calculations are based on a Monte Carlo procedure that uses a stochastic model of tornado occurrence, a probabilistic tornado windfield model, and distributions of tornado parameters developed from an analysis of 19,085 storms. Example calculations for different building sizes and lifeline geometries are given for four broad regions in the United States. One of the findings of the study is that tornado wind risk dominates the combined wind loading function for lifelines with lengths greater than about 10 miles (16 km). The estimated uncertainty intervals in the risk predictions range from a factor of 10 for 75 mph (36 mps) winds to several orders of magnitude for 200 mph (89 mps) winds.

The glass plate is assumed to be simply supported without any restraint for inplane displacements at the supports. The finite difference technique with iteration is used to solve the nonlinear equations. The number of iterations are reduced substantially by using an under relaxation parameter. Results are compared with other available solutions for accuracy as well as efficiency.

AB - The incremental launching method for concrete structures was first developed in the early 1960'S. Since then it has spread all over the world. Bridges constructed by this method are cast in segments behind an abutment in a stationary form against a previously cast segment of the bridge girder. The whole superstructure is then longitudinally jacked forward incrementally to make room for the next segment in the stationary form. This method combines the advantages of precasting with those of cast‐in‐place methods, resulting in a high concrete quality and low costs. Remarkable achievements of incrementally launched bridges the to data are: Longest continuous superstructure [3,809 ft (1,161 m)]; longest span in final stage [551 ft (168 m)]; longest span during launching with auxiliary stays on top [436 ft (133 m)]; and a strongly curved bridge superstructure in plan with a radius of 492 ft (150 m). The incremental launching method has also been applied to buildings; e.g. across railway tracks. A new potential application is the construction of underwater tunnels. The main savings are achieved by the reduced labor and equipment expenditure.

AB - Owing to the relative severity and unfamiliarity of the ocean environment, the scarcity of data about loads and materials, and the expense of data‐gathering, uncertainties faced in engineering of offshore structures are magnified compared to those associated with structures on‐land. The paper reviews methods for assessing offshore risks which are primarily technical in nature. These include risks attributable to natural or accidental loads, to structural materials, or to foundation deficiencies. Alternate approaches for quantifying or predicting risk and reliability are presented along with a perspective on the shortcomings of these methods in the context of offshore engineering. Two classes of models are reviewed: (1) Models used in reliability assessment under short‐term loading; and (2) long‐term reliability models in which occurrence patterns as well as magnitudes of loading are considered. The paper emphasizes the relationship between risk assessment and engineering decision analysis.

AB - The problem of dynamic alongwind response of structues to forces induced by atmospheric turbulence is treated in this paper. Starting from the classical formulation, the study suggests at first two structural standard models, called, respectively, point-like and three-dimensional, by which many actual structures can be idealized. Furthermore, a rigidity criterion is proposed to distinguish a priori between rigid structures, only requiring a quasistatic analysis, and flexible structures, for which a dynamic analysis is necessary. The remarkable simplicity and the very high precision of the criterion herein proposed suggest a good predisposition of this methodology to be introduced into codes and recommendations for the estimation of wind effects on structures.
