AB - A method is developed for calculating the probability of progressive collapse due to fatigue for structural systems in which members are connected in parallel and for parallel member systems connected in series. Formulation of the method is “exact” and is based on the assumptions of equal member load sharing and identically distributed fatigue lives. Numerical integration is used to evaluate the probabilities that also include the effect of statistical correlation between the fatigue lives of different elements. An expression to quantify the degree of correlation is developed. The method is applied to systems of up to eight parallel members, with each member consisting of an arbitrary number of joints of equal fatigue life connected in series. The resulting probabilities are compared to a previously published progressive collapse study, which used a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Insight is provided concerning the importance of correlation effects in systems fatigue analysis. The method can be useful in fatigue design criteria development, since it relates the reliability of an individual element to the reliability of the complete system comprised of the elements. Because the method is “exact,” it can be used as a good test case for future work in the development of system reliability methods for more general applications.

AB - A stiffness matrix for a beam on elastic foundation finite element and element load vectors due to concentrated forces, concentrated moments, and linearly distributed forces are developed for plane frame analysis. This element stiffness matrix can be readily adopted for the conventional displacement method. For the force method, an element flexibility matrix and element displacement vectors due to the aforementioned loads are also presented. Whereas most other analyses of a beam on elastic foundation finite element approximate the foundation by discrete springs or by cubic hermitian polynomials, the present stiffness and flexibility matrices are derived from the exact solution of the differential equation. Thus, results of this finite element analysis are exact for Navier and Winkler assumptions. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency and simplicity of the element.

AB - The results of a four‐year project, sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute, to investigate the fatigue design process in the welded joints of steel offshore structures are summarized. Fatigue damage expressions were formulated. A simple analytical expression for damage based on the rainflow method of cycle counting in a wide band process was constructed. Because fatigue design factors have significant uncertainty, a reliability approach, using the lognormal format, was developed. The performance of Miner's rule was characterized statistically, as was modeling error associated with the process of computing fatigue stresses in a joint from oceanographic data. Procedures of S‐N data analysis were developed, and characteristic S‐N data sets were presented. The reliability format was employed to construct a design rule for low period structures. It is argued that the new design rule is more discriminating in that it can account for service life, wave spectra, water depth, platform dynamics, as well as the location of the joint in the structure.

AB - The web crippling strength of manufactured, steel, rectangular hollow section tube side walls, or webs, under transverse compressive loads, is examined through experimental research on isolated, equal‐width, cross joints, where either plate or rectangular hollow section branch members are welded to a rectangular hollow section chord member. The results of 31 laboratory tests undertaken by the writer are presented, with 40 other tests undertaken internationally. Joint parameters covered include chord wall slenderness, chord aspect ratio, tube forming process, tube yield stress, bearing length, the inclination of the branch member to the chord, and chord axial load. Test data is correlated with 6 methods currently available for the prediction of the web crippling strength of such joints, and a suitable approach for strength estimation is recommended.

AB - The effect of large nearby buildings on the wind loading of low buildings has not been examined in the past. Wind loads for low buildings specified by current standards and Codes of Practice originate from wind tunnel studies on isolated buildings and give no guide for the assessment of loads under conditions of buffeting. The current paper presents the results of an experimental study carried out in a boundary layer wind tunnel in order to determine the wind loads on low buildings of different geometries (eave height and roof slope) in the presence of a tall nearby building at various relative locations. Results show significant adverse effects (wind load amplifications higher than 200%) for particular building proximity configurations. The complexity of the problem, however, indicates that it is very difficult to treat these buffeting effects with any degree of generality. Alternatively, it is suggested that local building officials should require the use of higher design loads after seeking a specialist's advice and possibly performing special wind tunnel tests.

AB - A 7‐story full‐scale reinforced concrete frame‐wall building was tested. The test structure was designed on the basis of the building code requirements in the United States and Japan for earthquake resistance. The reinforcement details were specified to reflect good construction practice in the United States and Japan. The test structure was subjected to static and dynamic loads. A single‐degree‐of‐freedom pseudo‐dynamic earthquake response test method was used to investigate the inelastic behavior of the test structure. Four increasing levels of earthquake input were used, resulting in maximum roof displacements of 2.52 mm, 32.5 mm, 238 mm, and 243 mm. Following the 4th pseudo‐dynamic test the damaged structure was repaired by epoxy injection and epoxy mortar. Reinforced concrete spandrel walls and various types of nonstructural elements were installed. Three pseudo‐dynamic tests similar to the 1st three were performed with maximum roof displacements of 3.03 mm, 65.3 mm, and 244 mm, respectively. A final static test to failure concluded the testing. The fundamental period of the structure increased to three times its initial period due to structural damage. The three‐dimensional characteristics of the building were significant even though the earthquake loading was only in one direction. The repaired test structure had overall behavior similar to that of the original structure.

AB - A simple alternative elastic‐plastic method to account for the P‐Delta effects of asymmetric sway structures is proposed. The method is applied to story subassemblages and represents an extension of a similar procedure previously applied to plane frames. The failure load of a given story is determined on the basis of an interaction principle which incorporates the rigid‐plastic collapse load and the elastic buckling load of the story. In contrast to existing equivalent methods no iterations are required. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the use of the technique.

AB - Modern buildings that satisfy current design guidelines for maximum static lateral drift still may vibrate excessively during windstorms to the point where the motion disturbs the building occupants. Static lateral drift criteria do not address explicitly the relation between the fluctuating component of structural response and the performance that is necessary to ensure that the building remains serviceable. This paper summarizes existing data regarding human tolerance of building motion and describes how a simple checking procedure for this serviceability limit state might be developed using random vibration theory to relate the fluctuating wind forces to structural response.

Data from recent turbine missile tests and existing empirical methods of perforation damage analysis were collected and compared. Selected formulas were chosen for improvement. For each, modifications are proposed which result in a more accurate prediction of the occurrence of perforation of reinforced concrete barriers by missiles typical of those that might be found at nuclear power generating facilities. Also, a method is given to allow perforation analysis of reinforced concrete barriers with a thin steel plate affixed to the back face.

AB - An experimental and theoretical study is presented on the strength of welded box compression members of high strength steel. The member cross sections are composed of plates with relatively large width‐thickness ratios so that local plate buckling is supposed to occur before the attainment of the overall member buckling. A total of 25 members of various lengths, width‐thickness ratios and cross‐sectional shapes (square or rectangular box) were tested to failure under bending as well as under concentric or eccentric axial loading. In the theoretical study a computer program has been developed, based on the effective width concept, to trace up to collapse the load‐deformation characteristics of locally buckled beam‐columns. By comparing the experimental and theoretical results it has been found that the agreement is reasonably good in the columns with large width‐thickness ratios.

AB - The natural frequencies of vibration and the corresponding mode shapes of a stiffened suspension bridge are determined, and the changes that occur in these characteristics with respect to parametric changes in the bridge are examined. A single‐span, planer structure with hangers and flexible cable supports is used to model a suspension bridge. The derivation of the governing equation of motion for the model is sufficiently general to be applied to a multispan system; however, only a single‐span case is studied. The use of flexible cable supports enables the single‐span model to represent a typical interior span of a multi‐span structure. The method of analysis is based upon a generalized Holzer method coupled with a linearized form of a discretized initial‐value formulation. Parameter studies are presented in which the vibration characteristics are studied as a function of cable sag, deck moment of inertia, and cable support stiffness. Of particular interest is the phenomenon in which there is a reordering of modal configurations that accompany the sequential array of frequencies in response to changes in certain parameters.

AB - There is a well established tradition for the use of dynamic test procedures, in the determination of the real characteristics of structures. These concepts have been extended by taking measurements of the bridge vibrations generated by the normal passage of vehicles, and analyzing these data to see if it was possible to determine the dynamic characteristics of the bridges. A preliminary investigation has been made of the possible assessment of structural integrity by means of these measurements. One of the factors that has been considered as a diagnostic tool is a plot of fundamental frequency versus span. A second possibility is an analysis of the overall vibration levels on the bridge, in relation to the energy input created by the traffic. Further work would seem to be justified, in order to determine the true value of this exploratory experimental study. This should include a comparison with other proven experimental techniques, as well as support based on theoretical predictions of bridge characteristics.

AB - Fatigue crack propagation and residual stress measurement tests were conducted by using deep‐notched wide plate specimens with repaired parts. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate numerically the effects of some weld repair methods and a mechanically patching method with high strength grip bolts on residual fatigue life. The test results proved that the conventional welded repair method with no special treatment reduced fatigue life due to high tensile residual stress induced by welding repairs. However, through application of adequate treatment to cracks, compressive residual stress was induced in repair welds to increase the fatigue life. The remaining fatigue life of welded repair parts was further investigated using Fracture Mechanics. The patching method with high strength bolts and welded splice plates, on the other hand, had a remarkable effect on retarding the fatigue crack growth rate by decreasing it after bolted repairs to about 1/100‐1/1,000.

AB - For many years, electric transmission line structures in the U.S. have been designed in accordance with the minimum load and strength requirements given in the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC). Transmission line designers have recognized certain deficiencies in the NESC and usually specify increased design loading requirements based on conditions in local service areas. This practice has led to a lack of uniformity in design criteria for transmission line structures in the U.S. and points to the need for a uniform design approach based on probabilistic concepts. A load and resistance factor design format is recommended in which the design factors are probability‐based. The design point method for reliability analysis is reviewed and a computer program which applies this method to transmission line structures is described. A calibration example is presented which illustrates the use of this program for establishing the level of reliability in an existing structure and the corresponding design factors. It is concluded that the methodology is quite suitable for application to transmission line structures and that sufficient data are available for determining the required design factors.

Particular attention is paid to the influence of local elastic wall deformation on the effective width and coupling stiffness of the slab. The influence of the size and position of the doorway opening is examined for a typical wall-slab configuration. It is concluded that the presence of a doorway opening does not significantly affect the effective slab stiffness.

AB - Softening, the decrease of bending moment capacity of a section at advanced curvature, may occur in a statically indeterminate reinforced concrete structure prior to the attainment of maximum load. Critical softening is that value of negative stiffness for a first formed hinge at which a structure cannot sustain increased load. The bending-moment versus softening parameter and load-deflection relationships for uniformly loaded fixed-end beams are derived, for sub-critical, critical and super-critical softening of first and second formed hinges. Corresponding load-deflection curves are presented, for particular values of hinge length and softening parameter.

AB - A deepwater application for catenary mooring systems is on guyed tower oil production platforms. The restraint provided by the mooring system is nonlinear, but an equivalent nonlinear spring can be used to simplify the dynamic analysis of such structures. The development of such a spring is presented. It was found that the coefficients were constant with water depth and therefore can be presented as design charts; there would be one chart for each mooring geometry.

AB - Information is presented to stimulate discussion that might promote a better understanding of the design of latticed structures for dynamic conditions. The report includes a survey of collapse or distortion failures and serviceability failures. Tentative conclusions, based on the published literature, are: (1) The dynamic characteristics of latticed structures have not been identified as a major factor in structural failures; and (2) fatigue of the roof membrane or connections induced by small vibrations appears to be no more of a problem for latticed structures than for other types of long span roof structures.
