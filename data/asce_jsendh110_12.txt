AB - The results of an experimental study on the fatigue behavior of transverse welded steel butt joints containing slag inclusion discontinuities are presented. Twenty‐four constant amplitude zero‐to‐tension fatigue tests were conducted. The 5 in. (127 mm) wide by 1 in. (25 mm) thick quenched and tempered steel specimens were manually welded using the shielded metal arc process. The size, shape, location, and number of slag inclusions entrapped in the welds were varied to examine the relative importance of these factors on the fatigue behavior. The onset of fatigue crack initiation was estimated by monitoring strain gages on the weld surface near the entrapped slag and by examining records of the ultrasonic signal from the slag inclusions. The test results indicate that: (1) Approximately one‐fourth of the total fatgue life was spent in initiating a fatigue crack, and that nearly 55% of the fatigue life was required for propagation of a crack to the weld surface; (2) a number of fatigue cracks initiated at small, unintentional discontinuities that could not be detected by radiography; and (3) the number of initiation sites and the slag inclusion sharpness, size and position are factors that appear to influence the fatigue behavior more than slag inclusion length.

AB - The writers performed an examination of glass damage in a localized downtown Houston area due to the effects of Hurricane Alicia. Indications are that the glass damage occurred even though the windspeeds in the area were probably less than applicable design windspeeds. In addition, results of this investigation suggest that the impact of windborne missiles, primarily roof gravel, was the major cause of the glass damage. This dramatic example of glass damage due to small missile impact is the latest example in a continuing pattern of glass damage due to small missile impact. The fact that roof gravel propelled at relatively low velocities can break all common types and thicknesses of glass has been firmly established in prior research. The reason for the extent of the glass damage in Houston is that applicable building codes and design procedures fail to recognize that windborne missiles are a major cause of glass breakage in windstorms. Specific changes to building codes which will help to reduce the extent of future glass damage are presented in this paper. If these or similar changes are not incorporated into building codes and design procedures, glass breakage will continue to occur in relatively mild windstorms.

AB - The use of epoxy repair for timber structures has proved to be both structurally efficient and economical. However, little information is available on the behavior of epoxy‐repaired timber during a fire. To evaluate this behavior for repaired truss joints, an experimental and theoretical investigation was conducted. The approach used was to: (1) Experimentally determine the epoxy‐to‐wood bond strength on small shear block specimens over a wide range of temperatures; (2) experimentally determine the time required for full sized epoxy‐repaired joints to fail when subjected to a sudden elevated temperature; and (3) develop a mathematical model which predicts the strength and duration of load for joints exposed to a sudden high heat condition. Based on a correlation of theoretical to experimental results, the theory was then utilized to obtain an approximate fire rating curve for epoxy‐repaired joints with glue lines at various distances from the exposed surface. A 30 min fire rating was obtained with the glue line at 3 in. from the surface and a 60 min rating was obtained with a glue line at 4 in. from the surface.

AB - A method based on finite element technique is presented for the analysis of reinforced concrete plane frames subjected to proportional vertical and lateral loading. The method considers nonlinear behavior of reinforced concrete plane frames arising out of material nonlinearity and large displacements. The method has several special features. It uses a single beam column element with five degrees of freedom (i.e., two end rotations, two end deflections, and one deflection at midlength position) for columns as well as girders. Analytical integration leading to closed form solution is used to evaluate the contribution of concrete area to the axial load and moment acting on the cross section. The iterative method, which is used for solution of nonlinear equations, is based on modified Newton‐Raphson technique. Convergence is ensured by resorting to Aitken delta square extrapolation technique. This method computes the complete load‐deflection response of the frame including the drooping branch. Two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of the method. The method, in its slightly modified version, is also applicable to steel frames.

AB - AS part of probabilistic safety analysis, the risk of structural damage to critical components of a nuclear power power plant from accidentally generated turbine missiles has been evaluated. Perforation and scabbing modes of failure are considered for concrete walls, whereas perforation in case of steel barriers is identified as the only mode of failure. Available empirical formulas for assessing local damage are evaluated using turbine missile test data from the U.S. and elsewhere. The most applicable formulas are selected and uncertainties in their predictions are evaluated and incorporated in the assessment of damage probability. Monte Carlo technique and Advanced First Order Second Moment (AFOSM) method are used in evaluating damage probability. Simplified methods derived for the assessment of turbine missile damage probability are compared with Monte Carlo and AFOSM methods, and limitations of the simplified methods are investigated. Evaluation of damage probabilities of multiple barriers are also illustrated. Bounds on damage probabilities are given using normal and chi‐square distributions.

AB - This paper presents data on the cost of increasing the seismic design level of buildings, for new construction, for five different concepts of lateral resistance. Damage is shown to be a function of both drift and acceleration. The structure is broken down into key elements for purposes of identifying drift and acceleration components, and damage ratios are estimated for these components as a function of levels of drift and acceleration. Each design level is analyzed for a series of loadings, and a damage matrix is formulated to relate damage, based on a summation of all components' individual damage, and the applied loading level. An economic analysis is performed to evaluate the cost of seismic lateral resistance design levels, the present worth of expected damage, and the probability of site acceleration levels. The economic analysis for the conditions of this problem suggests a range of ground motion having a return time of 60–100 yr before it is cost‐effective. The results are limited to the type of low‐rise construction studied, and are shown to be a function of the type of seismic lateral resistance concept used.

AB - Reliability indices are calculated for single timber beams and timber bridges with deck planks and stringers. Load and resistance models are developed on the basis of the truck survey and material test data available. Three common groups of species and two material grades are considered. The reliability indices are calculated using the Rackwitz and Fiessler procedure for the single beams, and Monte Carlo simulations for the whole bridges. The reliability indices for single beams are about 15–40% lower than those for whole bridges. The difference can be attributed to a distribution of load between the stringers because of the mechanical properties of wood, in particular the modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture and their correlation.

AB - Tube frame structures subjected to static or dynamic loads are usually analyzed by the finite element method in which the structure is represented by a large system of equations. This method, however, requires extensive alculations and considerable efforts in data preparation and output interpretation. The paper presents an approximate method in which the tube structure is represented by a continuum. The model considers the shear‐lag effect, which is significant in tube structures, as well as shear and flexural deformation. The continuous model is then represented by a set of first‐order differential equations. They are solved numerically using a fourth‐order approximation technique, and the results compared to results of finite element code. The resulting deflection, frequencies and mode shapes predicted by the continuous model show excellent comparison to the finite element results.

AB - A simplified elastic‐plastic analysis is presented for plates uniaxially compressed in their plane. The plates are not initially flat, and contain residual stresses due to welds at the longitudinal edges. Simple assumptions are made about the shortening‐deflection relationship, the modeling of welding residual stresses and the behavior of stress‐resultants after yielding. The assumptions are based on physical models, and are tested against data from previous numerical solutions. A full‐section yield criterion is used. The analysis is sufficiently simple to allow hand calculations. Load‐shortening curves are shown to be in good agreement with numerical solution methods and strengths are in agreement with test data. Simple criteria are given for the plate shortening at which the maximum loads are carried by welded and unwelded plates. These lead to single calculations of plate strength.

AB - A methodology for the study of reliability in wood structural systems under load is presented. The approach implements duration of load effects by means of a damage accumulation model, and combines it with a structural analysis of the system. The reliability under a random, varying load is then calculated at the end of the intended service life for the structure. Both strength and serviceability limit states are considered. As an example, the eliability of a flat roof under snow loads is studied. Weather data from two Canadian cities (Vancouver and Quebec) are used, and allowable roof spans are derived to satisfy a target reliability at the end of 30 yr. Load sharing and load duration adjustment factors are derived in relation to a design equation in Limit States Design format, with the condition that a prescribed reliability be associated with the resulting span.

Salient features of the test structures and the base motions are presented. A perspective of the structural response during the course of dynamic test runs is provided by the analysis of 10 nondimensional observation parameters. Remarkable similarities between the recorded response of the test structures having the same base motion intensities during the test runs are pointed out. It is concluded that the same base motion will produce basically the same response regardless of differences in the previous loading histories, provided that all of the previous loadings had intensities less than or equal to that of the loading under consideration.

Brief descriptions of the frame models and simulated earthquake tests, as well as the System Identification Parameters method in general, are provided. Then a special System Identification Parameters scheme is formulated to determine the optimum apparent structural system (a omputer model) which will produce the response closest to the recorded response of a frame model when subjected to the same base motion. This is done by varying apparent damage ratios of the structural members through a nonlinear optimization routine. The comparative discussion of six case studies pointed out the need for more sensitivity studies before stable and dependable results can be produced by this method.

AB - A method for finding a modified bending stiffness matrix for a member of varying section is presented. The assumption is made that the displacement function for a uniform beam may be used as an approximation to the correct displacement function, thus leading to greater simplicity in the computation, while providing sufficient accuracy for most purposes. It is shown that for two practical applications of the approximate stiffness matrix for tapered beams, economy of effort can be achieved without any great loss of accuracy. For large tapers, the accuracy of the method is acceptable. Even greater accuracy is to be expected for smaller tapers.
