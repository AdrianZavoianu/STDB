AB - The design of a prestressed section with assigned efficiency for members working for flexure is presented in the form of an analytical method which does not require iteration, use of tables or graphs or a solution of simultaneous equations. The section depth, the cover of tendons and effectiveness of prestress have to be evaluated at the start. The result of calculations can give a section fully stressed, or with stresses at the service stage satisfied exactly in case of a member with limited depth, or even a section with excessive capacity when it is desired. The section dimensioning is made in an approximate way, but required accuracy is easy to achieve. The introduction of the coefficient of dead load moments ratio in sections critical at transfer and at service allows it to take care of the differences between post‐tensioned and pretensioned members with constant eccentricity tendons or with harping points, without the necessity of providing appropriate allowances in stresses. Use of the method is illustrated by examples of design of a post‐tensioned member and a pretensioned one with harping points.

AB - An experimental program was conducted to study the behavior of concrete under low‐cycle high amplitude biaxial cyclic compression. Biaxial loading was achieved by subjecting square concrete plates to in‐plane loading where compressive stress was applied in one direction while confining the deformation of the specimen in the orthogonal direction. Three main types of tests were performed: Monotonic loading to failure; cycling of compressive stresses to a limiting envelope curve; and cycling of compressive stresses to prescribed values. In each category, tests were performed on specimens under different levels of strain confinement, and for comparison, on unconhned specimens. Complete stress‐strain histories were recorded and analyzed to assess the effect of confinement on concrete behavior under different nonproportional load conditions. A simple predictive model for the constitutive behavior of concrete in biaxial cyclic compression is proposed. Predicted behavior from the model which does not require any a priori information from experiments is found to be in good agreement with the measured response.

AB - An experimental investigation to determine the effect of variations in displacement history sequence and magnitude on cyclic response of reinforced flexural members is presented. Testing variables included shear stress as well as displacement history. Test results indicated that both member behavior and member energy dissipation capacity were functions of applied shear stress intensity and the magnitude of maximum displacements applied to the members. It was found that cantilever beam specimens of the type tested could endure many cycles of loading for all shear stress levels as long as beam‐tip displacement did not exceed 2% of beam shear span length.

AB - Analytical and experimental studies were performed on single and double‐tapered glulam members. An orthotropic finite element modeling was employed. Analytical predictions were confirmed by static load tests conducted on 10 full‐scale specimens. Tests to destruction were performed to observe the failure mode and ultimate strength of each specimen. Measured stresses at failure are compared to current design code provisions in the United States. The interaction of stresses concept of failure is evaluated in light of the results observed in this study.

AB - A finite element method is presented to analyze the effects of airblast‐induced ground shock on shallow‐buried, flat‐roofed, reinforced concrete structures. A finite element based on Timoshenko beam theory is adopted. Material properties are defined in terms of nonlinear stress‐strain relations in each of several layers through the thickness of the element. Elastic, ideally‐plastic constitutive properties for plain concrete are cast in terms of shear‐stress/normal‐stress variables. Elastic, strain‐hardening constitutive properties are assumed for steel. Dynamic explicit and implicit and static solution algorithms are available. General two‐dimensional structures, such as rings and arches as well as boxes, can be represented. This analysis method is applied to simulation of static beam‐column tests reported by ACI Committee 318‐77. It is then applied to simulation of structural response in FOAM HEST Events 2, 3 and 4 in which shear, flexure and combined shear‐flexure damage was observed. In these post‐test simulations, measured interface stress‐time histories are used as input.

AB - A simplified method of analysis is presented to predict the linear and nonlinear behavior of multi‐cellular structures and to evaluate the ultimate load of such structures. The continuous plated structure is idealized as a grillage and the effects of shear lag are taken into account by using empirical coefficients. Design curves are presented to account for the reduction in shear and torsional stiffness due to the presence of web openings. Results are compared to those obtained from a finite element analysis for a number of cellular structures to confirm the accuracy of the proposed approach in the elastic range. The grillage method is extended to the nonlinear range by adopting an incremental loading procedure; buckling of the compression flange is taken into account by adopting the concept of an effective width.

AB - A reinforced concrete beam section with a through‐thickness edge crack in the stretched part is considered. The eccentric axial force transmitted by the reinforcement to the concrete beam element, is estimated by means of a rotation congruence condition able to provide this statically undetermined reaction. In the field of linear elastic fracture mechanics, such a force increases linearly by increasing the external bending moment, until the limit force of yielding or slippage is reached. From this point on a perfectly plastic behavior of the reinforcement is considered. Once the bending moment of steel plastic flow is exceeded, the cracked beam segment presents a linear‐hardening behavior, until the concrete fracture occurs. It is shown how the stability of the process of concrete fracture and steel plastic flow depends on the mechanical and geometrical (scale included) properties of the beam cross section.

AB - Hand methods of calculating buckling loads of inelastic moment gradient beams are developed. An inelastic parameter, the stiffness modification factor, j, is used to estimate equivalent uniform tangent modulus rigidities for partially yielded simply supported beams. From this is developed a buckling moment equation. For laterally continuous beams, a step‐by‐step procedure which allows for interaction between adjacent segments is proposed. The structure is reduced to a critical subassemblage of beam segments. The stiffness modification factor is used to quantify segment end interaction and an effective length factor, k, is found for the critical segment. The buckling moment equation is used to estimate the beam capacity. A worked example and comparisons with theoretical and experimental results show that the proposals are accurate and simple to apply.

The relative influences of a range of structural parameters on the composite stiffness and effective slab width are evaluated, and design curves are presented to facilitate their determination in practical situations. It is shown that the influence of the coupling action is significant only when the lintel beam is relatively flexible.

AB - A comprehensive method for minimum cost design of simply supported, uniformly loaded, partially prestressed concrete beams is presented. Nine design variables are used—six geometrical dimensions, area of prestressing steel and area of tensile and compressive mild reinforcement. The optimum design is in accordance with ACI 318/77. The imposed constraints are on the four flexural stresses, initial camber, dead and live load deflections, ultimate shear and ultimate moment capacity with respect to both the cracking moment and the applied load. The nonlinear optimization is performed using the Penalty‐Functions method coupled with Quasi‐Newton unconstrained optimization techniques. The method, successfully applied to several design problems, both cracked uncracked, clearly indicates that numerical optimization can be used to solve design problems of interest to practicing engineers.

This study examines the strength of short columns with square or rectangular sections under loadings in directions corresponding to the principal axes of the section, as well as loadings in diagonal directions. The results from 20 tests were considered. It was concluded that the shear capacity of short columns under loadings skewed with respect to the principal axes could be estimated simply and accurately using interaction curves.

AB - Strength and stiffness distributions of wood‐stud walls were simulated on a computer using experimentally determined properties of framing, sheathing, and joints. Distributions were generated for conventional wall constructions framed with Douglas‐fir and southern pine studs of Stud grade, and sheathed with nominal 3/4 in. (19.0 mm) bevel siding of 3/8 in. (9.5 mm) plywood siding on one side and 1/2 in. (13 mm) gypsunv wallboard on the other side. This construction represents common types of walls with proven infield performance. Each simulated wall was analyzed by a computer model. The ultimate lateral load and average and maximum stud deflections were fitted to Weibull three parameter probability functions. The results, based on stud properties unadjusted for moisture content or load duration, indicate that all simulated wall types can sustain loads exceeding those expected in a 100 year wind. Actually, all wall types except those with 24 in. (610 mm) stud spacing would be safe under a 200 year wind in most parts of the United States. Such results are consistent with field observations, indicating that structural failures in light frame construction are not initiated in the walls, but rather in the connections between the walls and either the floor or roof. The results also show that walls with studs of either species display about the same performance, and that an occasional stud that does not meet the grade changes wall strength and stiffness very little.
