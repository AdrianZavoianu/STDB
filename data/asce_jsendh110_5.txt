AB - The active control of tall buildings by aerodynamic appendages was proposed with the purpose of minimizing the control energy used to generate the control forces. In this control mechanism, the appendages generate the control forces from the wind power, and the supplied control energy is only used for folding or deploying the appendages. A solution given in 1972 has made the appendage movement dependent only on the velocity of the vibrating building with respect to the mean wind direction. Another solution given in 1979 and 1981, which was more effective, was found by the optimal control theory, assuming the wind characteristics and the wind forces on the building are fully known. Based on this assumption, this paper shows that a tracking control can be developed which is superior to the previous solutions in both the controlled response and the consumed control energy. However, in practice, the difficulties encountered in the full knowledge of the wind characteristics and the wind forces overweigh the design given in 1972.

AB - The appropriateness of the National Defense Research Council (NDRC) equations for penetration and back‐face scabbing thicknesses are reevaluated using presently available test results. A nondimensional impact factor is introduced to improve the predictability of these equations. Penetration depths are estimated using NDRC, statistical NDRC, and the proposed Haldar equations. Although the NDRC equations predict the penetration depths for bullets reasonably well, they fail to do so for large missiles. The Haldar penetration equations are found to predict the penetration depths for all types of missiles. A similar relationship is proposed to estimate the scabbing depth directly by using the impact factor. However, this relationship is developed using only bullet data. For most large turbine missiles, the scabbing thicknesses need to be estimated indirectly using the information on the penetration depth. The applicability of the proposed penetration and scabbing thicknesses to large turbine missiles such as those postulated by the General Electric Corp. and Westinghouse, are discussed. The coefficients of variation for the estimation of penetration and scabbing thicknesses are large in all cases. Thus, in any probabilistic formulation like the one used for turbine missiles, they should be considered probabilistically.

AB - The response of a typical steel‐lined reinforced concrete nuclear reactor containment to uniform internal pressure monotonically increasing to failure is analyzed by nonlinear Finite Elements. Emphasis is placed on modeling the in‐place random variation of the properties of reinforcing bars and of the strength of mechanical splices. This natural variability is taken into account in approximation, through the use of “effective” stress‐strain laws of ensembles of mechanically spliced bars, developed by simulation on the basis of certain mechanical assumptions. It is found that due to progressive ruptures of bars and splices, the containment ultimate capacity is much smaller than that predicted on the basis of the ductility of reinforcement with uniform, average properties and with splices that do not fail prior to the bars, and is close to thepressure causing generalized yielding of the reinforcement.

AB - Stresses in double‐tapered, straight‐forward glulam beams are investigated by use of an orthotropic finite element method of analysis. Geometric and elastic materials parameters were varied to establish the sensitivity of the stress to these parameters. Beams studied were representative of beams that may occur in practice. Perpendicular‐to‐grain and flexural stresses from these results are compared to other methods of analysis and the current design provisions. Recommendations are made concerning the improvement of the present design procedures to reflect the findings reported in this paper. Graphs and equations of the perpendicular‐to‐grain tensile stress, as a function of the significant variables, are presented.

AB - A number of simplifying assumptions are applied to a previously developed multi‐curve interaction method that determines the failure load of sway frames. These simplifications consider the establishment of the required parameters from a subassemblage analysis, the replacement of a rigorous second‐order analysis by a magnified first‐order solution and the determination of the “limiting slenderness ratio” from a single‐cycle approach. Furthermore, a graphical presentation of the major parameters is demonstrated. In all instances, the procedures are illustrated by examples. The results obtained by the simplified techniques indicate a good correlation with more rigorous approaches thus confirming that the presented procedures are suitable as a substitute for full‐scale elasto‐plastic computer solutions. They also produce results which are superior to the Merchant‐Rankine rule, which was proposed by the European Convention for Constructional Steelwork (ECCS) and is intended for inclusion in the new British Specification for the Structural use of Steelwork in Buildings.

AB - A dynamic analysis of stresses and deflections induced by moving vehicles and by linear temperature variations in airport pavements which lie on viscoelastic foundations is presented. The increasing demand for heavier loads and higher speeds has necessitated more realistic modeling of both traveling vehicles and pavements. However, one of the major drawbacks in recent studies regarding dynamic behavior of pavements is that inertia effects of the traveling vehicles are usually neglected. In the present study, a direct numerical method derived from the structural impedance approach is used. The method is sufficiently general to include the complete kinematic relationships that describe the interactions between traveling vehicles and the supporting structures. Here, the algorithm is extended to a simple model developed to sufficiently describe the behavior of airport pavements. An ideal beam supported by springs and dampers simulating subgrade is chosen. The beam is subjected to temperature differentials which cause uplift and warping. Based on this model, several numerical examples are solved in order to identify the factors which influence the pattern and magnitude of deflections and stresses in the pavement.

AB - The stiffness matrix of a thin‐walled open‐section element including the effect of shear strains due to warping is presented. Closed form expressions for the stiffness coefficients are obtained for the case of negligible uniform torsion stiffness; an iterative procedure, based on a compatibilization scheme, is presented for the case when both uniform torsion and warping shear deformations are considered. The proposed element can be used for modeling core shear walls in multistory buildings and is suitable for implementation in a computer program based on the direct stiffness method. Two simple examples of multistory core wall structures are presented to assess the effect of uniform torsion stiffness and warping shear deformation on dynamic torsional behavior.

In addition, the behaviors of identically designed riveted and welded panels are compared. Shear strength and the slip load value of the rivets were determined with single‐shear strap tests for several combinations of sheet thickness. Based on the information obtained from the strap tests, 25 full‐scale flexural tests (17 single‐span, 4 two‐span, and 4 three‐span) were conducted to determine panel strength and deflection behavior. A summary of final design recommendations is also given.

AB - Structural walls connected by short coupling beams were investigated experimentally and analytically. Two one‐third scale coupled wall systems were tested with in‐plane reversing loads. The systems represented a lightly coupled wall with relatively weak beams and a heavily coupled wall with strong repaired beams. Under repeated inelastic load cycles, the lightly coupled wall system suffered severe damage in the coupling beams prior to yielding of the wall elements. The system subsequently behaved as two isolated walls in parallel. The heavily coupled wall system responded as a single structural element. High axial loads were induced in the walls from the accumulation of shear forces in the coupling beams. As a result, behavior and ductility of individual walls were significantly different from the lightly coupled system. An analytical model was developed to simulate experimental results. Parameters affecting behavior of wall systems were investigated. Comparisons were made between analytical results and experimental data. Redistribution of shear and moment through coupling beams was determined.

AB - A solution of the problem of bending of nonprismatic beams, including the effect of shear deformations, is presented. Such beams—called here shear beams—occur with some frequency as elements of 'stocky' rigid frames which are used in the mining and power industries and, most importantly, as both the horizontal diaphragms and the verical shear elements which are parts of structural systems resisting lateral loads due to wind or seismic excitation. The governing differential equations are derived, and their general solution is obtained in terms of a displacement function. This formulation underscores the near analogy between the problem of a shear beam and a standard beam and, in a number of cases, permits obtaining solutions directly from the known solutions of the corresponding problems of standard beams. Finally, a detailed solution is obtained for the problem where the depth of the beam varies linearly with the span. A numerical example illustrates the procedure. The results show that, in nonprismatic shear elements, the distribution of internal forces may be markedly different from that encountered in nonprismatic standard beams.

The platform is the second deepest in the world, and the installation of the three‐level drilling and production deck and two drilling rigs makes it the tallest, at a total height of 1,305 ft (398 m). The platform design is reviewed with emphasis on features unique to a guyed tower. Structural design, buoyancy tank design, guyed system design, pile foundation design, transportation and launch design, and pipeline riser design are covered. Severe storm analysis and fatigue analysis for the tower are also covered.

The supporting structure is, however, treated as being linear. Using this approach, examples of bicycle wheel type cable roofs are analyzed and the results compared with those obtained on a laboratory model as well as on a prototype. A parametric study of the laboratory model is also made.

AB - A method based on finite element technique is presented for the analysis of braced and unbraced columns. This method considers nonlinear behavior of reinforced concrete columns arising out of material nonlinearity and large displacements. The method consists of several special features. It uses a single beam‐column element with five degrees‐of‐freedom (i.e. two end rotations, two end deflections, and one deflection at mid‐length position). Analytical integration leading to closed form solution is used to evaluate the contribution of concrete area to the axial load and moment acting on the cross section. The iterative method which is used for solution of nonlinear equations is based on modified Newton‐Raphson technique. This method determines the loaddeflection response including the drooping branch. Convergence is ensured by resorting to Aitken's delta square extrapolation technique. This method is verified against available solutions and is found to be satisfactory. This method can deal with columns under all possible combinations of uniaxial (proportional)loading and end conditions (pin‐ended, braced, and unbraced).

AB - A structural system consisting of story‐deep and bay‐wide discrete panels to resist lateral loads is investigated. To study the overall behavior of this system and to compare with the conventional shear wall frame, four perspex models were tested for static as well as dynamic response. To investigate the behavior of a discrete shear panel and to study the effect of stress‐concentration at panel‐corners where skeletal members meet, three reinforced concrete panels were tested. The proposed system is found to provide adequate lateral stiffness to resist horizontal loads such as wind and earthquake forces. Discrete panels cannot be idealized as line elements (wide columns with rigid arms), and the finite element method must be used for the analysis of staggered panel frames. Local failure at corners of a panel can be avoided by extending the girder and column reinforcements through the length and height of the panel. Reinforcement in the interior of a panel can be the minimum required to resist the stresses due to shrinkage, temperature, and creep.

AB - Eight reinforced concrete specimens were fabricated and subjected to tensile membrane forces and air pressure to study the air leakage characteristics in cracked reinforced concrete members. A mathematical expression for the rate of pressurized air flowing through an idealized crack is presented. The mathematical expression is refined by using the experimental data to describe the air flow rate through any given crack pattern. Graphical charts are also presented for the calculation of the air leakage rate through concrete cracks. The concept of equivalent crack width for a given crack pattern is introduced. The mathematical expression and graphical charts are modified to include this equivalent crack width concept. The proposed technique is applicable for the prediction of the leakage from concrete containment structures or any similar structures due to high internal pressure sufficient to initiate cracking.

Three types of configurations are considered: (1) X‐braced; (2) Warren (with verticals); and (3) Vierendeel. The approach used here is to treat a truss segment having regular repetitive properties over an arbitrary number of panels as a superelement. Difference equations for each of the three truss configurations are derived and deflections found using finite fourier series. Based on these solution forms, stiffness coefficients are derived. The results are exact in the classical sense and enables a space truss with a large number of joints to be accurately reduced to a single member defined by beam type stiffness coefficients. This superelement can be used in conjunction with other elements to analyze complex truss systems such as guyed towers and space truss roof systems.

AB - Mat foundations are commonly used under structures whenever the column loads or soil conditions result in conventional footings or piles occupying most of the site. For mat foundations of minimal size and complexity, long hand techniques with or without mini‐computer assistance, may be acceptable. For large mats under major structures, more complex finite element techniques utilizing large main frame computers are normally required. Suggested guidelines are presented to aid the engineer in selection of finite element type as well as assisting him in discretionizing the mat into elements. Further information is provided on such topics as the modeling of superstructure rigidity, calculating of soil spring modulii, modeling of symmetric boundary conditions, incrementalizing of loadings to consider elastic and consolidation settlement effects, and the interpretating of element internal forces and their relationship to the mat design process. Additional information is also provided regarding the practical considerations with respect to the design and detailing of the mat reinforcement as well as some comments on mat construction procedures.
