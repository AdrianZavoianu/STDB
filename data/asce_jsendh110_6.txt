AB - Many large boundary layer wind tunnels have been commissioned in Japan over the past 10 years, giving Japan a commanding lead in this area of technology. Some reasons for this extensive building program include the recent concentration of government research institutes at Tsukuba, the increased emphasis on structural and bridge engineering by the heavy industry companies, and the emphasis placed on research by Japanese construction corporations. In general, Japanese universities have not been able to keep pace with the government and private sectors in providing their engineering laboratories with modern and expensive research facilities. Nevertheless, much of the new and exciting work in wind engineering is being done by the universities. The very substantial investment made in boundary layer wind tunnels over the past two years suggests that Japanese heavy industries and construction corporations see a bright future for wind engineering. It is concluded that a significant penetration of the U.S. market for specialized engineering services is likely to occur within the next few years. The paper presents basic dimensions and performance characteristics for several wind tunnels and four new boundary layer wind tunnels are described in detail.

AB - Analytical methods are used to develop design values for the number of stress cycles caused by the passage of a truck across various types of spans of steel highway bridges. Vibration stresses and close truck spacings are shown to have little effect on such design values under normal conditions. For the main longitudinal members in simple‐span bridges, the design value is 1.0 for spans above 40 ft (12 m) and 2.0 for shorter spans. For the main longitudinal members near interior supports of continuous‐span bridges, the design value is 1.5 for spans above 40 ft and 2.0 for shorter spans. For the main longitudinal members elsewhere in continuous‐span bridges, the value is 1.0 for spans above 40 ft and 2.0 for shorter spans. For transverse members, the value is 1.0 if the spacing between members exceeds 20 ft (6 m) and 2.0 for smaller spacings.

AB - The significance of lack of fit in structural steelwork for buildings is studied. Lack of fit is caused by rolling or fabrication tolerances, welding distortions, etc. When imperfect fit occurs between elements, supposedly transferring load, site disputes often arise over the necessity for remedial action. Imperfect contact is of particular significance in friction‐type bolted connections when there may be visible separation between the faying surfaces. The paper reviews the effect of imperfect contact on the development and maintenance of the bolt preload, the required contact area size and disposition, the coefficient of slip, joint slip resistance and ultimate strength of the connection. It is concluded that lack of fit is detrimental for some slip resistant and fatigue resistant joints but otherwise is not structurally significant, especially where the bolts act primarily as high tensile fasteners. To clarify this distinction, the use of friction‐type bolts in general is reviewed. Test results pertaining to lack of fit in flush end‐plate connections are presented.

AB - Wind data from Weather Bureau Airport Stations (WBAS) at Seattle, Wash, and Baltimore, Md., from 1959 to 1979 are used to verify previous analytical results of the effect of wind direction on structural reliability. The feasibility of theoretical prediction of long‐term direction effects based on shortterm data is also investigated. It is found that the analytical method correctly predicts the mean values of the annual maximum response and gives reliable estimates of the sensitivity of structural response to the change in structural orientation. However, there are large discrepancies in the scatter parameter of the annual maximum response which cannot be fully explained by either the sampling error or the deviation of the actual velocity distribution from a Gaussian model.

AB - Cold‐formed channels are joined by means of spot welds to form various configurations. They are used in typical electrical cable and conduit supports, also in power plants. The present design procedures follow AISI specifications, which gives the allowable load per spot weld as a function of the thickness of connected plates. Tests were carried out to establish the distribution of spot weld capacity. It has been found that the strength strongly depends on technology of welding. It is recommended to review the AISI provisions and specify special allowable loads for spot welds connecting cold‐formed channels. The allowable loads could vary depending on type of connection (backto‐back, side‐to‐side, side‐to‐back) and technology of welding (degree of correlation between adjacent welds).

AB - An energy‐based plate buckling formulation is adapted specifically for use in predicting local buckling behavior of W shape members used as columns, beams, and beam‐columns. The method includes the effects of flange and web interaction, residual stresses, and elastic and inelastic behavior. The analytical technique utilizes computer computational methods and it is verified by comparing predicted buckling behavior with the behavior observed in 53 laboratory tests conducted by independent researchers. The analytical technique results in good agreement of predicted behavior with that observed during testing procedures. The technique is thus validated and is considered to be a reliable method for studying a broad range of parameters which affect the local buckling behavior of W shapes used as columns, beams, and beam‐columns.

AB - An analytical method, previously developed and programmed for computer use, is used to carry out an extensive study of the various parameters affecting the local buckling behavior of W shape columns and beams. The effects of flange and web interaction, residual stresses, plate geometry, and inelastic action are included in the study. Specific parameters investigated include web slenderness, flange slenderness, yield stress, residual stress, strain‐hardening modulus, and member length. Local buckling curves of critical loads versus web slenderness are presented for various values of flange slenderness for beams and columns. The results of the study indicate that the present values of flange slenderness =100 (260) and web slenderness =225 (670), as presently specified for columns in the Canadian Standard, CAN3‐S16.1‐M78, are inappropriate. Values of flange slenderness =72 (189) and web slenderness =300 (788) are indicated. The results also show that the presently specified values of flange slenderness =100 (260) and web slenderness =690 (1,810) for Class 3 (non‐compact) sections may be too liberal with respect to the flanges and conservative with respect to the web. Values of flange slenderness =72 (189) and web slenderness =800 (2,100) are indicated by the study. The effects of all the parameters investigated during the study are shown in the form of local buckling curves as described here.

AB - The eigenvalues associated with beam‐columns, which rest on elastic supports, are determined by an initial‐value numerical method. These eigenvalues can be related to the buckling loads, critical foundation constants, or natural frequencies of vibration. Interrelationships between these eigenvalues are examined and three‐way dimensionless critical diagrams display the results of this study for single‐span structures with various boundary conditions and for multi‐span structures. These show that, for the cases presented, the square of the natural frequency varies linearly with respect to both the axial load and the elastic support constant. For all cases studied, there are different, but similar, interactive relationships for each mode shape. These critical diagrams enable the analyst to determine the axial load‐support constant‐natural frequency combination for a critical condition to exist—that is, an eigenvalue solution with a unique mode shape. Several example problems are included to illustrate the use of the dimensionless critical diagrams.

AB - An investigation of the dynamic behavior of a cross‐rope‐suspension system (CRSS) electrical transmission line structure is presented. Experimental and theoretical studies, which included both modal and forced‐response analyses, were performed. An analysis of the techniques employed and a comparison of results is included. The most important result is that the conductor modes appear to add destructively at low frequencies so that the coupling supplied by the cross‐ropes is unimportant in this range. However, at higher frequencies the dynamic response coupling between the conductor phases is larger and there may be a greater tendency for the system to vibrate in the “subconductor‐oscillation” range. It is shown that good interaction between the development of the theoretical model and the experimental analysis and the desirability of having a theoretical analysis before the test are important.

AB - Using linear elastic fracture analysis, the energy consumed per unit length of fracture (fracture energy) varies with the crack length, as described by the resistance curve (R‐curve). This concept, originally proposed for metals, is developed here into a practical, applicable form for concrete. The energy release rate is determined by an approximate linear elastic fracture analysis based on a certain equivalent crack length, which differs from the actual crack length, and is solved as part of structural analysis. It is shown that such an analysis, coupled with the R‐curve concept, allows achieving satisfactory fits of the presently existing fracture data obtained with three‐point and four‐point bent specimens. Without the R‐curve, the use of an equivalent crack length in linear analysis is not sufficient to achieve a satisfactory agreement with these data. The existing data can be described equally well with various formulas for the R‐curve, and the material parameters in the formula can vary over a relatively broad range without impairing the representation of test data. Only the overall slope of the R‐curve, the initial value, and the final value are important. A parabola seems to be the most convenient shape of R‐curve because the failure load may then be solved from a quadratic equation. For the general case, a simple algorithm to calculate the failure load is given. Deviations from test data are analyzed statistically, and an approximate relationship of the length parameter of the R‐curve to the maximum aggregate size is found.

AB - The results of a series of 14 full‐scale tests on reinforced concrete pipe columns are reported. For each of these tests, a complete set of synchronously measurements, covering the entire range of loading, are acquired. The tests were controlled by deflection increments when the loads were near and beyond the maximum, or peak value. These data are utilized in developing a design method for reinforced concrete pipe columns. Based on the 14 full‐scale tests, the mechanics of progressive failure of reinforced concrete pipe columns is demonstrated through the explanation of the maximum load point, or the Pmax point, which represents the nonlinear stability load of a column, and the maximum strength point, or the Mmax point, which corresponds to the ultimate strength of the critical cross section. Based on the difference of the Pmax point and the Mmax point, a deflection formula to estimate the maximum load carrying capacity of a reinforced concrete pipe column is presented. It is recommended, as an alternative method, for the design of reinforced concrete pipe columns.

AB - The fatigue strength of cover plate ends, retrofitted with splice plates and high strength bolts in friction, was determined experimentally. The flanges at the cover plate ends were noncracked, half precracked, or fully precracked prior to retrofitting. The first condition applies to rehabilitation, the others to repair of cover plated girders. The mean fatigue life of the retrofitted noncracked cover plates exceeded the AASHTO Category B mean and was 18.2 times longer than the Category E mean. The difference in the fatigue lives of the retrofitted half precracked and fully precracked cover plates was statistically insignificant. Their combined mean life was a factor of 12.9 longer than the Category E mean. Web cracks were arrested by drilling a hole at the crack tip and installing a high strength bolt. Cover plate ends retrofitted as recommended in this study are fatigue proof when subjected to highway bridge loading.

The transverse vibration and elastic wave propagation methods are used to get the dynamic elastic modulus. The results from six reinforced concrete beams in three pairs, each pair consisting of two identical beams, are presented. Being nondestructive these tests can be used repeatedly on the same specimen to study aging, durability, resistance to frost, etc. It is found that the Code value of modulus of elasticity for concrete agrees more with the value of dynamic modulus obtained from transverse vibration method than that obtained from stress propagation method. This may be due to the nonhomogeneous nature of concrete and the presence of steel bars in the beams. The stress propagation method can be used for quality control of concrete products because the pulse velocity depends only on the elastic property of the material and not on the geometry.

AB - A linearly elastic beam finite element, dual to the Timoshenko beam model, is developed. Shear effects are included, but unlike the Timoshenko element, which is essentially an equilibrium model (stress compatibility enforced), the proposed element is a displacement model (strain and displacement compatibility enforced). Shear distorsions are accounted for by defining a set of internal degrees of freedom, which are subsequently eliminated through use of a condensation procedure to yield the element stiffness matrix in terms of nodal degrees of freedom only. The stiffnesses thus obtained are shown to be upper bound estimates of the corresponding exact values, whereas the theory of the Timoshenko beam provides the associated lower bound estimates. A comparison of the predictions of the two models shows a good agreement over a wide range of aspect ratios.

AB - The elastic flexural-torsional instability of monosymmetric I-beams and cantilevers is investigated using a general energy approach based on the vanishing of the second variation of the total potential energy. For simply supported beams, closed form solutions are presented which are valid for a wide range of section properties and which include the influence of pre-buckling displacements. Where the closed form solutions become inaccurate, and for cantilevers, numerical results are presented.

AB - Estimates of tension leg platform (TLP) surge presented in the literature are generally based on the assumption that the tethers are straight at all times, i.e., that transverse deformations of tethers due to hydrodynamic and inertial forces may be disregarded. The purpose of this note is to verify the validity of this assumption in the case of a deep water TLP. The equation of motion of the tethers for the platform being considered is a nonlinear partial differential wave equation. The numerical solution of that equation showed that, for an assumed harmonic motion of the platform, the hydrodynamic and inertial forces that cause the tethers to deflect will increase the amplitude of the restoring force on the platform by a factor of about three. However, the resulting platform motion does not differ significantly from that corresponding to the assumption that the tethers are straight.
