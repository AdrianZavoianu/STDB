AB - Uncertainty in basic structural parameters is characterized by objective and subjective information. A method was developed to quantify this uncertainty and propagate its effect through a structural reliability analysis. Certainty levels are established on the resulting failure probabilities. The concept of confidence intervals from classical statistics is extended to include both objective uncertainty, e.g., that due to limited sample size, and subjective uncertainty, e.g., data interpretation and extrapolation. The uncertainty is propagated by separating the objective and subjective information in the basic input random parameters and, also, in the calculated random probabilities. An example truss problem illustrates an application of the method.

AB - The ultimate strength is derived for a composite beam comprising a ribbed slab and steel section with a large rectangular web opening. Shearing force is assumed to be carried in both the steel section and the slab at the opening, and the method accounts for partial shear connection. Good agreement is demonstrated with maximum loads measured in tests. Comparison with a more detailed theory presented elsewhere shows good agreement over the full range of moment‐to‐shear ratio. Caution is recommended when applying the theory to cases differing substantially from the parameters of the test beams.

AB - The influence of grid refinement, load increment size, and concrete tensile strength on the nonlinear response of reinforced concrete finite element models is examined. Nonlinearity is limited to cracking of the concrete and yielding of the reinforcement. A stress controlled smeared cracking model is used. Emphasis is placed on cracking patterns and convergence of load‐deflection curves. Analyses are performed for flexural members with span‐to‐depth ratios of 12:1 and 2:1. Load‐deflection curves exhibit convergence with grid refinement. Below a certain magnitude, load increment size does not affect the stiffness or the response in stable regions of the load‐deflection curve. Concrete tensile strength has a negligible influence on response for the members studied.

AB - An approximate energy method for evaluating the buckling capacity of coped beams subjected to concentrated load at the mid‐span has been developed. The method consists of evaluating several trial buckling loads by varying a shape parameter 7. The lowest of the trial loads represents the buckling load. It is shown that the proposed method yields buckling loads which are close to those obtained experimentally. It was found that the reduction in buckling load due to coping can be quite significant depending upon the particular situation. This fact has been ignored by the AISC specification. The standard buckling equations are usually based upon the assumption that the load is acting through the shear center. It was found that the effect of load acting on the top flange (rather than the shear center) is very significant—even for uncoped beams. In coped beams, the effect of mismatched shear centers at the junction of the coped and uncoped part further adds to the same effect. These effects are also ignored by the AISC specification.

AB - A simple procedure is described by which to obtain estimates of maximum inelastic response displacements for a certain class of reinforced concrete building structures subjected to strong ground motions. The procedure is based on elastic response spectrum analysis techniques. Change in vibration period and energy dissipation attributable to inelastic response are taken into account. The procedure is tested by comparing maximum computed displacements with those measured in numerous tests of small‐scale structures. Results of the comparison indicate that the procedure produces good results for a variety of structural systems and over a wide range of response.

AB - Seismic response of four irregular reinforced concrete test structures is interpreted using static analysis methods. The four test structures were simplified models of multi‐story building frames comprising frames and framewall combinations. Discontinuities in the vertical plane of the structures were introduced by discontinuing the structural walls at various levels. It is found that standard limit analysis and static inelastic analysis provide good measures of strength and deformation characteristics under strong earthquake motions.

AB - The crack band model is applied to the problem of crack shear in concrete. The constitutive law for concrete within the crack band is provided by the microplane model, in which the microstrains on weak planes of various orientations (the microplanes) are assumed to conform to the same macroscopic strain tensor, and the microstresses from all the microplanes are superimposed. Due to the neglect of shear stiffness on individual microplanes, the material behavior is completely characterized by the relation between the normal stress and strain for each microplane. To simulate crack shear, the law for unloading contribution on the microplanes after previous tensile strain‐softening is important, since the shear stresses resisting crack shear, as well as the normal confining stresses and crack dilatancy, result from compression along lines inclined with regard to the crack plane. A satisfactory agreement with the existing results from shearing tests of cracked concrete blocks (i.e., aggregate interlock tests) is achieved. Since the same type of model was previously shown capable of modeling strain‐softening in direct tensile tests, fracture of notched specimens, and deflections of cracked reinforced beams, the present model appears to have a general applicability. It can be applied to the shearing of cracks only partially formed (a system of distinct discontinuous cracks still in the strain softening stage), to cracks that are being produced simultaneously with shearing, to crack shear when the direction of shearing within the crack plane rotates, and to shearing of concrete intersected by cracks of various directions. Thus, the model appears suitable for general finite element programs.

AB - The behavior of double‐angle bracing members subjected to in‐plane buckling due to severe cyclic load reversals is investigated. Eight full‐size test specimens made of back‐to‐back double angle sections, connected to the end gusset plates by fillet welds or high strength bolts, were tested under large amplitude cyclic loading. Some test specimens, designed by current code procedures showed failures during early cycles of loading. Based on the observations and analysis of the behavior of test specimens new design procedures are proposed to improve the ductility and energy dissipation capacity of double angle bracing members and their connections to withstand severe cyclic loadings.

AB - The Galerkin method of weighted residuals is used in the 3‐dimensional analysis of asymmetric tall buildings subjected to lateral loads. Using polynomial shape functions, approximate displacement functions are obtained for both rigid and flexible foundations by minimizing the virtual work done over the entire height of the building. Numerical examples are solved and compared with existing results to validate the technique for both uniform and nonuniform sectional properties. The method is shown to be elegant and produces results within reasonable accuracy.

AB - A mechanical model for the cross section of a reinforced concrete beam is proposed. Attention is focused on the local phenomena relating to the cross section, while the phenomena relating to the beam element to which the section belongs is ignored. In particular the concrete fracturing mechanism and the slippage and yielding of steel are considered, while the smeared damage of concrete are not taken explicitly into account. Namely, a rigid‐plastic constitutive law is assumed for steel, while for concrete a linear elastic one. Loading and unloading processes are considered, the bending moment range being lower than that of crack extension. The phenomenon of shake‐down due to slippage or plastic deformation of the steel bars is studied. Up to a certain value of the bending moment an elastic shake‐down occurs; above this value the shakedown becomes elastic‐plastic and an hysteretic loop is described by the stressstrain diagram of steel. Thus the energy absorbed in such a dissipative phenomenon is computed for each loading cycle and some experimental results are reviewed.

AB - A rheological stochastic model to predict the cyclic stress‐strain behavior of concrete subjected to uniaxial compressive loading is proposed. The model consists of rheological elements with random state variables with exponential distributions. The model has 3 parameters and can be calibrated by experimental data from only the monotonically increasing loading. It simulates well the main known characteristics of concrete response to cyclic loading, such as strain softening, path dependency, stiffness degradation, and the concept of envelope curve. The formulation is of the total strain type and all formulas are derived in closed form. The model is computationally efficient for predicting response to any arbitrary strain history. A flow chart for computer implementation is presented.

AB - Recent analytical research on the topic of plastic collapse has led to the development of a new method which permits the direct computation of the generalized shakedown load of conventional rigid frame structures composed of flexural members made of elastic‐perfectly plastic materials. This new method is entirely based on energy principles and has led to the novel insight that alternating plasticity, shakedown and plastic collapse are simply three discrete points on a generalized “incremental collapse envelope,” which is analogous to the Goodman‐Gerber diagram for predicting fatigue strength of metals. Moreover, this new method for predicting the ultimate strength of rigid frame structures subject to varying‐intensity repeated loads can be generalized to yield information on useful life in a manner analogous to the Palmgren‐Miner Law for the cumulative fatigue damage of metals. Illustrative results from the application of the new method are given for one‐bay, two‐bay and three‐bay frame structures.

AB - Four different failure modes, stud shearing, concrete pullout, rib shearing and rib punching are described for metal deck stud shear connections. Equations for predicting the strengths associated with those failures are derived. Behavioral comparisons are made between companion specimens subjected to monotonic and reversed cyclic loading. It is shown that the type of failure greatly influences the strength, ductility and reversed cyclic loading response. The benefits of using larger stud‐spadngs, staggering of the studs, larger rib widths and ribs parallel to the direction of applied shear are demonstrated.

AB - Rules for determining the spacing and widths of both through‐thewall and surface cracks in post‐tensioned concrete containment structures under internal pressure are presented. These involve the construction details and the average strain obtained from an analysis that accounts for concrete properties in the post‐cracking range. To evaluate these rules and the concrete constitutive relationship used in the analysis, twelve quarter‐scale segments were designed to simulate construction and stress conditions at various locations of a containment structure. Major variables included ratio of prestressing, concrete cover, reinforcement spacing, lap splices and combined axial load and moment. It was observed that the crack spacing depended on the spacing of the reinforcement and prestressing tendons parallel to the cracks and that the final crack pattern was fully developed at the yield strain of the reinforcing steel. Concrete cover was not found to have a significant influence on crack spacing. The procedures developed to determine crack spacing and widths are used to predict the cracking of a one‐fourteenth scale model of a containment structure tested later in the research project.

Sixty‐six (66) stiffener specimens and 62 gusset specimens were tested under constant amplitude stress cycle after 2 and 4 yr of atmospheric exposure without paint. The 2‐yr and 4‐yr weathered specimens showed no reduction of fatigue life when compared with nonweathered specimens. An additional 10 stiffener specimens were cut from web of an actually used weathering steel bridge. They were weathered for about 5.5 yr, and showed fatigue behavior equivalent to that of the 4‐yr weathered stiffener specimens.

AB - Based on the elastic plate buckling theory, the development of criteria for maximum connection spacing in cold‐formed steel cellular panels subjected to gravity loading is presented. In such thin‐walled members, the maximum allowable spacing is governed either by the strength of the connection, or by local buckling of component compression plates. The determination of connection spacing can be based solely on the connection strength criterion when the connected elements are subjected to in‐plane tensile stresses. However, when the component parts are in compression, it becomes necessary to constrain the separation of compressed plates along the lines of connections so as to preserve fully composite action. The spacing criterion developed here for preventing the separation of the cover plate from the fluted sheet of the panel ensures the continuous stiffening effect along each line of connections. The requirement regarding unstiffened flanges is determined by assuming a slight amount of rotational restraint along its supported edge. In addition, the current connection design provisions adopted by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) are reviewed. The AISI provisions and the proposed requirements are compared with the available experimental data, and a sample problem is solved in an appendix.

AB - The spectral method, previously generalized for aging linear systems, is applied in conjunction with the finite element method to analyze shrinkage stresses in aging viscoelastic structures exposed to random environmental humidity. The age‐dependence of both drying diffusivity and creep properties are taken into account. The solution of pore humidity is obtained from a matrix differential equation in time, with complex‐valued matrices. Elastic shrinkage stresses are then obtained from the matrix equations of the finite element method, in which the matrices are also complex‐valued. The stresses in presence of aging creep are determined by a superposition integral in time based on the relaxation function. Numerical examples concerning a long cylindrical vessel exposed at the outer surface are given. The standard deviations of pore humidity and of stresses significantly vary with time, and their standard deviation exhibits fluctuations about a drifting mean. The solution is practically meaningful only if concrete does not crack, e.g., when a prestress sufficient to prevent cracking is introduced. For environmental fluctuations of long periods, such as one year, the computation is quite efficient; however, if shorttime fluctuations are considered, the computing time becomes very large.

AB - The safety of ten structures which were damaged in the 1964 Alaska earthquake and two in the 1971 San Fernando one was assessed by considering seven subjective factors not evident in the usual resistance and load measures. The subjective factors were the financial climate, labor conditions, political climate, weather, quality of inspection, experience and organization of the design and construction team and the location of the structure. Verbal statements about the effect of these factors on safety and the susceptibility of each of the dozen structures to these factors were converted into fuzzy sets which were then combined to predict changes in the objective probability of failure. These fuzzy modifications were then organized into subjective seismic safety assessments.

AB - The degeneration of two classes of deep beam elements is conducted, one (DB6) based on the conventional Timoshenko beam assumptions and the other (DB7) based on the assumed cubic order longitudinal displacement profile. While an adjustable shear correction factor is required for the DB6 element to compensate for the unrealistic distribution of a shear strain across the beam depth, the DB7 element assumes the more realistic quadratic profile of shear strain at the outset. With the plane‐stress continuum solution serving as reference in static and free‐vibration analyses, solutions obtained by these two element models are compared with the analytical Timoshenko solution, the analytical thin beam solution and several available solutions of existing beam elements. The result indicates that the performance of the higher order beam element DB7 is seen to be more versatile than other models previously developed by various investigators. Also, superior accuracy of the results is evident in both analyses over a wide range of the beam aspect ratios.

AB - The elastic flexural‐torsional buckling of cantilever I‐beams is investigated. The cantilevers have rigid translational or rotational restraints or both at discrete points. The effect of the beam parameter, K, the load height, the location of restraint positions along the beam, and the level at which the restraint acts have been studied using the finite integral method. Results are presented graphically as ratios of the increased critical load of the partially braced beam and the corresponding critical load of the unbraced beam. The beam load cases considered are concentrated loads and uniformly distributed loads. The effectiveness of the restraint locations and the types of restraint are investigated. Experiments conducted using extruded high strength aluminium I‐section are reported. Test results obtained are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions.

AB - Design criteria for lateral load effect of two‐hinged, parabolic, steel arch bridge structures are presented on the basis of the ultimate limit state design concept. The arch structures are composed of two main ribs connected by a lateral bracing system. The load combination that is considered consists of vertical loading and practical lateral loading to which bridge structures are actually subjected. Based on results of their load carrying capacity analyzed by three‐dimensional finite element method, ways of incorporating practical lateral loading effects in the ultimate strength designing of steel arch bridge structures are presented. The required out‐of‐plane rigidities of steel arch bridge structures are also proposed.

AB - Eccentrically braced steel framing in seismic applications can provide high elastic stiffness and large inelastic energy dissipation capacity. The performance of this framing system depends to a great extent on the behavior of short active link sections of the beams. The results of an experimental investigation of the effects of inelastic loading history, connection details, and web stiffener details on active link behavior are presented. The test results are then evaluated using energy dissipation as the basic parameter. A design procedure for active links which yield primarily in shear is then outlined. This procedure includes recommendations on the determination of structural configuration, member sizes, link connection details, and web stiffener details. Suggested connection and stiffener details are illustrated.
