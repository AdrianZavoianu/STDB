AB - For deep‐water offshore structures, the fundamental period of lateral vibration is a key factor influencing their design feasibility. This period can be controlled by a rational selection of the parameters governing the stiffness of these structures. These parameters and their relative significance in determining the stiffness properties have been identified. A mathematical springmass model to portray the stiffness behavior of platforms is introduced. Data are presented to show how stiffness properties can be rationally augmented. The conclusions of the aforementioned parametric studies are verified with reference to a fixed jacket platform in 450 m water depth. The participation of foundation flexibility in influencing stiffness is also investigated. Finally, a concept of insert piles and a strategy for designing deep‐water fixed jackets, and guyed towers for stiffness are introduced.

AB - The theory presented in this paper predicts racking deformations in wood‐stud shear walls. The energy method employed defines the wall performance in terms of the lateral nonlinear load‐slip behavior of the nails which fasten the sheathing to the frame. Using power curves to define the nail loadslip relationship, the theory predicts that wall deformation due to nail slip will also be defined by a power curve. The theory also includes linear deformation due to shear distortion of the sheathing material, and provides accurate estimation of wall performance up to moderate load levels. The method presented should be of interest to engineers who design light frame structures, to researchers, and to those who are concerned with building codes.

AB - Modeling of the interface shear transfer (aggregate interlock) and dowel action mechanisms as means of transferring shear stresses along preformed cracks is of great importance in determining the stiffness characteristics of reinforced concrete. An expression of an “effective” tangent shear modulus of precracked reinforced concrete panels subjected to combined in‐plane shear and biaxial tension is presented based on equilibrium, compatibility, and constitutive relationships for the average stresses and strains in the concrete and steel. The proposed engineering model for shear transfer is compared with experimental results of concrete panels orthogonally reinforced with #6 bars.

AB - A database of snowdrift case histories on multilevel flat roofed structures has been established and is statistically analyzed. Drifted snow loads on multilevel roofs account for a large percentage of the roof losses in the U.S. However, little quantitative information is presently available about factors which influence drift formation. The process of drift formation is discussed; and a relationship between drift height and ground snow load, roof lengths, and roof elevation difference, obtained using multiple linear regression is presented. Drift slope and snow density characteristics are also studied. Finally, snowdrift case histories are compared with drift load provisions in building codes and load standards and recommendations for future research are made.

AB - Three simply‐supported 1.5 m (60 in.) square, 60 mm (2.4 in.) thick under‐reinforced prestressed concrete slabs, with corners held down, have been tested to failure under centrally applied concentrated loading. Prestressing was applied eccentrically in both directions by straight bonded 7 mm (0.24 in.) or 5 mm (0.20 in.) diam wires. The concrete cube strength 50N/mm2—7,500lb/in.2) and diam of the loading platen (152 mm—6 in.) were kept constant while steel ratio was varied. Measurements of concrete strains, steel strains, slab deflections and corner reactions were taken during the tests. Final failure of each slab was by punching either along, or at a distance from the perimeter of the platen after the development of the yield‐line mechanism. It is shown that the collapse load can be predicted reasonably by the load required for fan mechanism development. For a slab with corners held down, but without corner‐lever reinforcement, it is shown that the yield load can only be predicted and distinguished from a similar one with corners allowed to lift, by taking into consideration the flexural strength of concrete across the corner lever.

AB - Wood used in structural applications can be a durable material. However, conditions in the surrounding environment can cause premature deterioration. Two common and related conditions are decay and weathering. An experimental investigation was conducted to evaluate the effects of weathering and decay on the epoxy repair of timber. In one phase, unprotected epoxy repaired joints were exposed to natural weathering in the southeastern United States. Joints were periodically loaded tested over a 4‐1/2 yr period and correlated to accelerated weathering tests on small epoxy bonded shear block samples. It is recommended that the dry condition shear strength of epoxy repaired Southern pine be reduced by one‐third when the repaired member is exposed to natural weathering conditions. Also, normal precautions (including preservative treatments) should be taken if the repair is exposed to weathering over a multi‐year period. A second phase consisted of epoxy repairing both lightly and heavily damaged weathered and decayed material. The strength of the repaired joints compared well with that of undamaged material. However, caution is advised in initiating such repairs without careful evaluation.

AB - Solar collectors comprise the most visible aspect of large photovoltaic central stations, yet structural costs represent only about 15% of total plant costs. Although the design wind speed is the controlling design parameter, the incremental cost of a station with fixed flat plate collectors is increased only about 2% when the design wind speed is increased from 90–110 mph (40–49 m/s). It is equally significant to select a site with stiff soil properties to reduce foundation costs. For one‐axis tracking collectors, which typically stow horizontally at 38 mph (17 m/s), the maximum wind speed is unimportant. Use of a simplified wind pressure distribution in place of wind tunnel test data provides a conservative design except for collectors subject to severe turbulence effects near the edge of the field. The aeroelastic behavior of collectors should be investigated in wind tunnels to evaluate the potential for unacceptable vibrations due to vortex shedding or flutter.

Load‐deflection response, ultimate shear capacities, stirrup stresses, surface inclined crack widths, and internal crack widths are discussed. The results indicate that the shear capacity of a large reinforced concrete beam is not affected by the transverse spacing of stirrups across the web width.

AB - An approximate closed‐form solution is presented for the computation of effective widths of floor slabs in laterally‐loaded multi‐story buildings. The resulting formula yields answers in good agreement with existing numerical techniques throughout the entire range of slab aspect ratios and column sizes found in practice. Since the necessary computations consist essentially of a summation of two series and thus, can readily be performed on a programmable calculator, the proposed method is especially suited for quick estimates of effective width at the preliminary design stage. The proposed method can easily be extended to anisotropic slabs and to boundary conditions other than those usually assumed in analyses of this type.

AB - Extensive results of tests to collapse I‐section plate girders with stiffeners at various angles of inclination, along with an analytical interpretation of the results, are presented. A simple model for determining the ultimate shear in the absence of moment is obtained based on the experimentally observed geometry of the tension creases, while the observed shift of the neutral axis toward the tension flange suggests a simple expression for the corresponding ultimate moment in the absence of shear. Finally, at critical sections whose definition is based on the observed collapse mode, an interaction relation between the two is proposed. For each angle of inclination, a simple nondimensional graph is exhibited of the moment‐shear interaction at critical sections as a function of stiffener spacing.

AB - Preliminary analyses are performed to obtain insight into the seismic response of light, acceleration sensitive nonstructural subsystems supported on structures that yield during severe earthquake ground motions. The effects of the severity of the inelastic deformations, of different hysteretic characteristics of the structure and of the amount of viscous damping of the subsystem are thoroughly investigated. Current design recommendations for subsystems accounting for yielding of the supporting structure are assessed and found to be unconservative. An amplification factor is defined to quantify the effects of inelastic deformations of the supporting structure on subsystem response. Design guidelines are formulated for predicting the amplification factor based on statistical evaluation of the results generated for ten earthquake ground motions. Using these values, design floor response spectrums can be obtained from conventional linear elastic floor response spectrums accounting for yielding of the supporting structure without having to perform inelastic analysis.

AB - Typical spectator movements were simulated by persons individually on a force platform with which dynamic force components were measured. Impulsive loadings are produced by movements such as rising, sitting, or jumping off the floor, while continuous loadings are generated in repetitive motion such as swaying, bending and straightening knees repetitively in place, jumping or dancing. Descriptive parameters derived from statistical and spectral studies of the load samples are presented. In particular, the vertical components of the impulsive loadings are modeled as random forcing functions, and a narrow‐band live load spectrum is proposed for checking potential resonant response of a structure to coherent crowd jumping for serviceability and human comfort. Resonant vibration of a structure can be reduced considerably by installation of energy‐dissipating devices. A revised design methodology for assembly structures is proposed to insure both structural integrity and functional serviceability.

AB - A rational procedure for evaluating the performance of two and three dimensional finite elements is developed. This procedure compares the strain energy content and the strain distribution of the finite element model to that of the continuum region it represents for well‐defined strain states. The use of Taylor series expansions which relate the displacements, rotations, and strains through strain gradient terms allows the strain energies and the pointwise strains of the finite element model and the continuum to be directly compared. The evaluation procedure is demonstrated by applying it to a six‐node isoparametric element undergoing a series of progressive initial distortions. From these results, a simple algorithm to predict the maximum strain energy error as a function of initial geometry is developed for incorporation into finite element codes at the grid generation level.

The procedure is entirely analogous to the wellknown moment distribution method. Structures to which it applies include crane girders, box‐girder bridges, and vertical shear elements of high‐rise buildings with prismatic, thin‐walled, open sections. The formulas for the necessary constants including warping stiffness, warping carry‐over factors and fixed‐end warping moments are given, and the procedure is illustrated with the aid of an example of a continuous crane girder which demonstrates its efficiency. In order to make the paper self‐contained, the equations of mixed torsion are summarized in Appendix I.

AB - Softening, the decrease of bending moment capacity of a section at advanced curvature, may occur at locations within a statically indeterminate reinforced concrete structure prior to the attainment of maximum load. The stiffness matrix for an elastic flexural member with a softening portion is derived, employing the necessary assumption of a finite softening or discontinuity length. For positive values of the softening parameter the stiffness values are as for a beam with a prismatic haunch. For negative values of the parameter stiffness coefficients become unstable at the critical softening parameter for a fixed-end beam. The derived stiffness coefficients allow use of standard frame analysis programs without special treatment for softening. An example of softening at the base of one column of a portal frame is given, showing the effect of softening on sway displacement. The frame demonstrates instability at the critical softening parameter for the particular position and length of the softening hinge.

The proof demonstrates decreasing monotone behavior of an objective function that is proportional to the weight at convergence. In addition, it is speculated that both the lower and upper bound can be attained with relative ease through iterations, and may be useful as a ``guidance pair'' for minimum weight design.
