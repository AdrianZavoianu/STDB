AB - Very little experimental data is available regarding extensional stiffness in uniaxially or biaxially tensioned reinforced concrete elements. In order to improve our understanding of this important subject an experimental study was performed to determine an estimate for the effective extensional stiffness, KN, of precracked concrete panels orthogonally reinforced with No. 4 or No. 6 grade 60 reinforcing bars and subjected to uniaxial or biaxial tension. These panels are meant to be representative of a segment of a cracked containment wall subjected to internal pressurization. To obtain a relationship for the extensional stiffness, the total surface axial deformation was measured in the direction of applied tension. The tension stiffening effect of concrete was accounted for by estimating an average effective steel strain corresponding to an equivalent bond‐free reinforcing bar.

AB - An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the coefficient of static friction between rolled steel plate and cast‐in‐place concrete or grout. Fifteen tests were performed under conditions that represented the interior and exterior bearing surfaces of a containment vessel. Test parameters included concrete blocks or grout blocks, wet or dry interface, and level of normal compressive stress. For conditions tested, the average effective coefficient of static friction varied between 0.57 and 0.70. It is recommended that the coefficient of static friction for concrete cast on steel plate and grout cast below steel plate should be taken as 0.65 for a wet interface with normal compressive stress levels between 20 and 100 psi (0.14 and 0.6 MPa). For dry interface, the coefficient of static friction should be taken as 0.57.

However, studies on steel fiber reinforced concrete elements have been devoted primarily to observations under unit actions. The present report gives the results of thirty plain and fiber reinforced concrete beams, the majority of which are tested under combined actions of moment and shear. The principal variables are the concrete mix proportion, fiber volume fraction and shear span.

AB - As part of a wall system in low‐rise industrial buildings, cold‐formed Z‐section girts are attached along one side to cold‐formed steel panels and are often supported along their span by sag rods. Thus, some degree otrestraint is present against the lateral and rotational displacement of these girts. The use of sag rods as a bracing device is often rejected in design on the assumption that the wall panels, once erected, provide adequate lateral restraint to the girts. However, if the wall system is under negative pressure, the Z‐sections are attached to the wall panels along the tension flange. In this case, the bracing contribution of the wall panels is also neglected in the design calculations. Results from a theoretical and experimental program showed that the omission of the restraint contribution of sag rods and steel panels leads to overconservative designs.

AB - Utilizing a recently developed analytical procedure, linear responses of the tallest non‐overflow monolith of Pine Flat Dam to Taft ground motion are presented for a range of properties for the reservoir bottom materials and various assumptions for the impounded water and foundation rock. In these analyses, the alluvium and sediments at the reservoir bottom, up‐stream of the dam, are modeled by a reservoir bottom that partially absorbs incident hydrodynamic pressure waves. Based on these response results, it is demonstrated that the earthquake response of dams is increased by dam‐water interaction and decreased by reservoir bottom absorption with the magnitude of these effects depending on the flexibility of the foundation rock and on the component of ground motion. It is also shown that the significance of the response of dams to vertical ground motion was overestimated in earlier studies assuming a rigid reservoir bottom.

AB - Constitutive properties of concrete under dynamic loading are necessary for the rational analysis of concrete structures subject to impact and impulsive loads. The constitutive model presented herein models microcracking through the use of a continuous damage parameter for which a vectorial representation is adopted. The rate of increase of the damage is dependent on the state of strain as well as on the time rate of strain. The constitutive equations are derived from the strain energy function which is influenced by the accumulated damage. The constitutive model is calibrated using uniaxial tension (or flexural) and uniaxial compression test data. The calibrated model is then used to predict certain other load responses of concrete.

AB - Steel‐concrete composite box girder bridges may have a flexible open box section‐prior to the placement of the slab. Excessive twist or distortion can arise under construction loading. Bracing systems are usually installed within the girder during construction to increase the torsional and distortional stiffness of the open section. The influence of these bracing systems on open box behavior is discussed usingsfinite strip analysis results and a one‐quarter scale girder model test data. Tie and distortional bracing were found effective in preventing distortion, with web stiffening found to be more effective than interior cross bracing. Horizontal bracing at the flange level was considered to reduce twisting of the section. This bracing can take the form of either torsion boxes or top chord bracing, both being effective. A torsion‐bending analysis based on a rigid section behavior is reviewed.

AB - A method is described for extending the conjugate beam concept to the solution of the combined effect of shear and flexure in frames and nonprismatic elements. A consistent sign convention is adopted. The method distinguishes between, and evaluates, the slope and cross‐sectional plane rotation. These two different rotations usually occur under the influence of shear. In structural analysis these rotations have different considerations: the rotational stiffness and rotational flexibility, of an element, are associated with the cross‐sectional plane rotation but deflection of the element is related to the slope of the deflection curve. The method provides an efficient tool for frame analysis, especially when evaluation of displacements is required at several locations in the structure.

AB - An elastic analysis is presented for the initial buckling and the postbuckling Behavior of simply supported built‐up columns consisting of two slightly separated identical parallel elements that are joined together at their ends and middle by rigid connections of negligible axial extent. Numerical results for initial buckling indicate that a familiar design rule (to make the slenderness ratio of the individual elements between fillers riogreater than that of the column as a whole) will not necessarily lead to a buckling strength approximating that of the integral column. The post‐buckling numerical results, in the form of loadshortening curves, show that the post‐buckling behavior is unstable, i.e., the load required to maintain, any buckled configuration is less than that required to initiate the buckling. This post‐buckling instability, which is in marked contrast to the virtually neutral stability of the solid elastic column, has important implications regarding imperfection sensitivity. Embedded in the general analysis is that of the 2‐connection column obtained by omitting the middle connection.

AB - Strength determination in usual structural engineering practice is based on failure under monotonically increasing, proportional loadings. The effects of nonproportional load sequences are largely ignored. Specificallyrinformation on column behavior in steel building frames is generally obtarrted from analyses under proportionally increasing axial loads and bending moment, although the former, largely due to gravity loads, are likely to precede the latter, which are primarily caused by lateral loads. To explore these effects, the investigation in this paper proceeds in the following steps. Based on measurements of strains during uniaxial cyclic tests of mild steel specimens, a cyclic stress‐strain law is formulated, and verified against test results. Secondly, this stress‐strain law is incorporated into an analysis to predict the response‐of structural steel sections under arbitrary applied axial load and moment sequences. The results of this analysis are again verified by comparison with test data. Finally the section analysis is used to explore the effect of different axial load‐momenrfustories on the response of column sections, and it is concluded that column deformations are insensitive to sequence of load application.

AB - Two impact studies on a small span, composite girder highway bridge have given widely scattered impact fractions, with a maximum of 1.32, compared with the AASHTO code value of 0.30 for this bridge. Field strains were used to measure maximum midspan bending moments for 170 trucks in normal traffic, and these were compared with equivalent static values computed from axle weights measured by a weighbridge. Impact fractions varied from −0.08 to +1.32 for gross vehicle weights from 27–44 ton. Large impact values occurred for both light and heavy vehicles and were repeated in two independent series of tests. The scatter of the results suggests that impact is vehicle dependent, and that it may vary with suspension geometry. Possible causes of high impact are examined.

AB - The paper is a summary of the results of an experimental program conducted at the University of Texas to investigate the structural behavior of 7 shear wall assemblies used in manufactured housing. Variables studied include the size and location of the shear wall within the assembly, the number of glued sides of hardwood paneling, and the number of floor joists beneath the shear wall. It was found that walls located on the windward side of the assembly had higher ultimate strengths. In addition, measurements of slip between the shear wall and side walls indicate that there may be significant load transfer into the side wall. Also, the side walls, it was found, do not provide rigid vertical support to the joists beneath the shear wall, as currently assumed in design.

AB - The paper presents an evaluation of the behavior and strength of gusset plates on the basis of an experimental investigation of full‐scale diagonal bracing connections. Sugh connections commonly occur in heavy industrial structures, for example. The evaluations are based on analyses of load and deformation data that were generated during the tests, including the failure patterns for the plates. A total of six tests were run, using three bracing member orientation angles. The results are correlated with analytical studies, with special emphasis on recent finite element work. The results are found to be in reasonable agreement Current design practices are discussed briefly; some of the methods are shown to be in acceptable agreement with the tests. It is shown that plate boundaries, plate buckling, and related out‐of‐plane bending phenomena have significant effects on the plate behavior. Recommendations for additional work are also made.

AB - The response of interior reinforced concrete plate‐column connections in a laterally loaded structure is investigated. Nine specimens were tested, five statically and four dynamically. This paper describes results from dynamically tested specimens. Experimental variables included slab reinforcement ratio. Nominal slab dimensions were 6×6ft(1.8×1.8m). Slab thickness was 6 in. (76‐mm). The column was square with plan dimensions of 1×1ft(0.3×0.3m. Reinforcement layout in the slab was isotropic. Dynamically tested specimens provided data on the strength, stiffness and energy‐dissipation characteristics. For joint rotations of approximately 0.02 (related to earthquake design) the stiffness of the slabs corresponded to that calculated from a fully cracked section for one fifth of the slab width, and the associated equivalent viscous damping was approximately 5% of critical.
