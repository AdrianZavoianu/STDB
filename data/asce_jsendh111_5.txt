AB - Many examples of wood roof trusses built in the early 1900's still exist today. The compression members were often composed of built‐up, vertically laminated lumber sections inadequately tied together and often laterally unbraced for substantial distances. Delaminations due to seasonal swelling and shrinkage forced the pieces to behave individually. The resulting overstresses initiated lateral buckling which became amplified by creep in the wood over an extended period of time. The roof surface warps and tears; moisture enters, and evidence of a problem finally becomes visible. Serviceability, and more importantly, safety, is threatened. A relatively unknown repair technique to permanently straighten and strengthen bowed and fractured truss compression members utilizes structural steel shapes to clamp and squeeze out the bow. A series of 1911 wood scissors trusses which/were fractured and near collapse, were recently saved by this technique. The primary advantages of this repair method are simplicity, economy, avoidance of roof removal, and minimal intrusion on the original esthetics.

AB - The capacity of columns can be increased by using crossarms and pretensioned stays. It is shown that the buckling load of a single crossarm stayed column is a function of the stiffness of the stays, and the ability to achieve that buckling load is a function of the residual tension in the stays at buckling. If the initial pretension is small, then the stays can become slack before the buckling load is reached. If the initial pretension is large, the column will buckle before the stays lose their pretension. It is shown that columns in which stays lose their pretension before buckling occurs have a lower buckling load than columns in which stays do not. It is also demonstrated that initial imperfections reduce the capacity below the buckling load of the perfect column. Loss of pretension for a low initial pretension does not cause failure, but for a high initial pretension precipitates instability. Simple but accurate equations are presented that allow noncomputerized solutions to be generated. The theoretical results are compared with recently published results.

AB - An attempt was made to study the effect of the number of nails on the stiffness of laterally‐loaded timber joints with interface friction, fabricated with 2–8 nails in a row. A mathematical model was developed to predict the load‐slip behavior of the joints. An experimental program investigated the effect of the number of nails, and some 140 joint tests were conducted, in total, in the present research. The current design concept that a joint fastened together with multiple nails in a row carries a lateral load equal to the product of the lateral capacity of single nail joint, and the number of nails in a row of the joint is somewhat of an overestimation of the overall capacity of the joint. Modification factors are developed to account for the effect of the number of nails in a row on the stiffness of joints with multiple nails. Experiments were also conducted to determine the parameters required for the application of the theoretical model. Frictional forces between the constituent members of joints were observed to be constant for joints with 3–8 nails in a row. The load‐slip curves of tested joints and the corresponding curves obtained from the theoretical model are compared with each other to verify the extent of the validity of the model. The theoretical predictions yield an upper bound solution for all types of joints—seven different types—tested in this research.

AB - Current design assumptions for diaphragms assume support conditions which are either simple span or fully continuous. The building codes require a design based on the highest values for moment and shear obtained under either of these two support conditions. More practical criteria for assessing continuity conditions at supports for wood diaphragms are needed. This investigation is to determine experimentally the effects of continuity conditions on timber floor diaphragms with plywood sheathing subject to inplane loads. Previous testing programs have evaluated simply‐supported diaphragms subject to uniform loading; this study evaluates the effects of other support conditions and non‐uniform loads. Static loading conditions were used to evaluate the response of the diaphragm for both deflection and ultimate strength. Six 8 ft×16 ft (2.44 m×4.88 m) floor diaphragms typical of certain residential construction techniques with three different sets of boundary and loading conditions were tested in accordance with ASTM E72. The tests demonstrated that: (1) Continuity over a rigid support apparently does not increase the unit shear resistance values of the diaphragm; (2) concentrated loads on the diaphragm produce lower load factors than moment‐equivalent uniform loads at a given load level; (3) there is not an apparent direct relationship between relative panel displacement and overall diaphragm deflection for the size diaphragms tested; and (4) local panel buckling has a minimal effect on overall diaphragm failure patterns.

AB - Eccentrically loaded high strength bolted tee‐to‐column connections were investigated experimentally. The tee and column flanges were fastened with A325 high strength bolts, and the eccentric load was concentrated and directed through the tee's web. Thus, the bolts were subject to shear and tension. Load transducers were used to obtain the bolt forces. The connection was loaded until bolt fracture occurred. Three parameters were investigated: (1) The number of bolts; (2) the thickness of the tee flange; and (3) the eccentricity of the load. The test results are compared with current design methods. Recommendations are made for design.

AB - A common practice in multistory reinforced concrete building construction is to shore a freshly placed concrete floor on several previously cast floors. The construction loads on the supporting floors may exceed the slab design loads during maturity, especially when the design live load is small compared with the dead load. A few studies have been conducted to analytically model the construction loading process. However, these early models are based on a number of simplifying assumptions. The objective of this paper is to develop a three‐dimensional computer model which can be used to evaluate the effect of variations of the foundation rigidity, column axial stiffness, slab aspect ratio, and shore stiffness distribution on the values of the shore loads and slab moments.

AB - Laminated flat glass is gaining popularity as an architectural glazing product. Despite its increased use as a cladding material, its structural properties are not well known. Research undertaken to advance understanding of the behavior of laminated glass units under lateral pressure representing wind loads is reported. Laminated glass units are comprised of two layers of glass connected by a thin interlayer of polyvinyl butyral. The material properties of the interlayer are very different from the properties of the glass plates which it joins together; its modulus of elasticity in shear is only about 1/10,000th that of glass. Experimental stress analyses were conducted on several laminated glass units to ascertain whether their behavior was similar to a monolithic glass plate of the same nominal thickness, or to a layered glass unit consisting of two glass plates with no interlayer. At room temperature the laminated glass unit behaves much like a monolithic glass plate of the same nominal thickness. At elevated temperatures [170 °F (77 °C)] the behavior changes, and approaches that of a layered glass unit with no interlayer. Results of the experimental stress analyses are compared with theoretical stress analyses designed to characterize the behavior of monolithic glass plates and layered glass units.

AB - An experimental study of the inelastic cyclic load‐deformation behavior of welded built‐up square box‐section short columns subjected to cyclic axial loading is presented. A total of 10 test specimens were fabricated from mild (σy=240N/mm2) and high strength (σy=700N/mm2) steels, having plate elements with the width‐thickness ratios of 40, 60 and 80 for mild steel, and 40 and 60 for high strength steel. Furthermore, monotonically increased loading tests were carried out for comparison with the deformation behavior of cyclic loading tests. This paper emphasizes the development of alternating local instability of plate elements associated with cyclic loading sequences. The hysteretic loops of average stress versus axial strain curves are expressed experimentally, and analyticalinterpretations are added to the results. Successive reduction of the ultimate strength and residual deformation at zero‐load are provided experimentally and analytically under cyclic loadings.

AB - The behavior of rods and tubes as horizontal tension members is investigated. In the design of double diagonal tension bracing, each member must carry the tension forces as well as its own weight either by cable action in the case of rods, or by beam action in the case of tubes. Rod tensioning experiments reveal that pretensioning forces are much higher than expected. However, excessive pretensioning of rods does not effect their ultimate capacity but would influence the design of the compression members in the bracing system. It is found that the tensile capacity of tubes is only marginally reduced by the effect of self weight and the self weight bending stresses need not be considered in combination with axial tensile stresses. Bending under self weight alone need not be checked as deflection always governs the design.

AB - Simple nonlinear stress‐strain relations for brick masonry constructed with solid pressed bricks are derived from the results of a large number of biaxial tests on square panels with various angles of the bed joint to the principal stress axes. The macroscopic elastic and nonlinear stress‐strain relations are determined from, displacement measurements over gage lengths which included a number of mortar joints. Although the initial elastic behavior is found to be close, on average, to isotropic, the nonlinear behavior is strongly influenced by joint deformations and is best expressed in terms of stresses and strains referred to axes normal and parallel to the bed joint. A given strain is related only to the corresponding stress by a power law, except when the ratio of the shear to normal stress on a bed joint is greater than 1. In the latter case, a bilinear relation is more appropriate. Dependence on other stress components is masked by the variability in the results.

AB - An analytical technique for predicting the local buckling behavior of thin‐walled sections was used to predict elastic and inelastic local buckling capacities of axially loaded hollow structural sections. The technique, similar to a finite strip method, is based on the principle of virtual work and uses a Rayleigh‐Ritz solution procedure. The effects of manufacturing process and interaction between adjacent plates are included in the formulation. The method is verified by comparing predicted loads with available test results and known elastic solutions of plate buckling. Various parameters considered to be significant in affecting local buckling capacities of hollow structural sections are evaluated.

AB - This paper deals with uncertainty in the prediction of the effects of creep and shrinkage in structures, such as deflections or stresses, caused by uncertainties in the material parameters for creep and shrinkage, including the effect of random environmental humidity. This problem was previously analyzed using two‐point estimates of probability moments. Here the same problem is analyzed using latin hypercube sampling. This has the merit that the number of required deterministic structural creep analyses is reduced from 2n to approximately 2n, where n=numberofrandomparameters. A method of taking into account the uncertainty due to the error of the principle of superposition is also presented. The mean and variance of creep effects in structures are calculated and scatter bands are plotted for seven typical practical examples, and the results are found to be close to those obtained with two‐point estimates. Further, it is demonstrated that the distribution of creep effects is approximately normal if the creep parameters are normally distributed. Finally, it is shown that good results may also be obtained with the age‐adjusted effective modulus method, which greatly simplifies structural creep analysis.

AB - The behavior of double‐angle bracing members subjected to out‐of plane buckling due to severe cyclic load reversals is investigated. Nine full‐size test specimens were subjected to severe inelastic axial deformations. Test specimens were subjected to severe inelastic axial deformations. Test specimens were made of back‐to‐back A36 steel angle sections connected to the end gusset plates by fillet welds or high‐strength bolts. Five of the test specimens were designed according to current design procedures and code requirements. These specimens experienced fracture in gusset plates and stitches during early cycles of loading. Based on the observations and analysis of the behavior of these specimens, new design procedures are proposed for improved ductility and energy dissipation capacity of double‐angle bracing members which buckle out of plane of gusset plates. Tests of four specimens, designed using proposed procedures, showed significant improvement in their performances.
