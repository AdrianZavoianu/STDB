AB - On the basis of the failure criteria developed in an earlier paper by the writers, the utilization of partial section plastification in cold‐formed steel flexural members is presented. As in the limit design procedures developed for reinforced concrete, failure is defined in terms of the strain capacity of stiffened compression flanges, for specified values of the width‐to‐thickness ratio of the flange and the yield stress of the structural steel. Accordingly, depending upon the slenderness of the compression flanges and the cross‐sectional shape, ultimate moment capacities in excess of yield moment become possible. As design and analysis aids, formulas to compute the ultimate moment capacity of commonly used cold‐formed steel shapes are derived. To illustrate the use of these equations and the economy gained by taking into account the inelastic reserve capacity due to stress redistribution, two example problems are solved. The findings are compared with test results and an elastic soluton.

AB - Post‐yielding strength of redundant cold‐formed steel flexural members, due to moment redistribution, is presented. The reserve strength due to section plastification is discussed in an accompanying paper. In an earlier paper, the development of the failure criteria was presented, and limit analysis and design procedures, similar to those developed for reinforced concrete members, were proposed. It is shown that the use of the proposed limit design procedure results in considerable savings, due to both stress and moment redistribution. As cold‐formed steel structural sections, in the form of floor and wall panels, roof decks, and framing members are increasingly used in building construction, the inclusion of inelastic reserve strength may become an economic necessity. Additionally, the availability of reliable methods to predict behavior beyond the initiation of yielding would help provide realistic safety factors against complete failure.

AB - A method is presented for determining the probabilities of a structure sustaining various levels of damage due to seismic activity during its lifetime. Uncertainties in the loading and the structural response analysis are considered. The method is based on a nonlinear random vibration analysis and an analytical technique for evaluating the sensitivity of the response to various structural and load parameters. Recently reported data are used to update the parameter values commonly used in the random process representation of earthquakes. The method is illustrated by analyses of a four‐story steel frame building and a seven‐story reinforced concrete building.

AB - The hysteretic behavior of a simply supported prismatic steel column with initial out‐of‐straightness subjected to cyclic loading is presented. The analysis is based on the plastic hinge concept, which under the assumption of perfect plasticity together with the one‐dimensional idealization of the column, has led to an elegant closed form solution for any history of axial loading. The exact yield curve of any type of cross‐sectional shape is adequately approximated by a piecewise linear interpolation of the fully plastic states in pure bending and in pure tension and compression. The results presented here illustrate the imperfection sensitivity of column cyclic behavior. The effect of various slenderness ratios combined with different initial imperfection sizes as well as the effect of different approximation to the exact yield curve are also presented.

AB - Welding a cover plate to a rolled beam and high‐strength bolting the loose ends with a friction‐type connection increased the fatigue strength from Category E for end‐welded cover plates to Category B. The required number of end bolts is that needed to develop the cover plate's portion of the bending moment. A parametric analysis indicated that the design of two‐span continuous bridges with end‐bolted cover plates subjected to HS‐20 truck loading was not governed by fatigue. The weight savings from shortening the cover plate from its Category E length to the length between the theoretical cut‐off points were greater than the added cost of end‐bolting. This method of construction has the potential of fatigue proofing cover plates on rolled beams while lowering their cost of fabrication. It utilizes existing technology and can be implemented at once. Tests of 22 beams showed that end‐bolting the loose ends of welded cover plates increased the fatigue life by three categories, from EB. End‐bolted cover plates on bridge girders can usually be stopped at the theoretical cut‐off point. Such girders are fatigue proof and cheaper to fabricate than conventionally end‐welded cover plates.

AB - A structural reliability evaluation is performed of the current AASHTO fatigue specification for steel bridges. The reliability model incorporates uncertainties in vehicular loading, analysis, and fatigue life. Field data is obtained from a weigh‐in‐motion system, which utilizes existing bridges as equivalent static scales. The load data includes truck axle and gross weights, headways, impact, stress range, girder distribution, and volume. A fatigue life model is formulated in terms of a fatigue failure function. Using the loading and fatigue life data a safety index is calculated using a level II reliability program. The study reviews the current specification in order to derive uniform reliability levels over the range of typical designs. The proposed revisions include: (1) A design vehicle model more representative of the current U.S. truck population; (2) changes in allowable stress ranges to eliminate variations in safety index; and (3) a range of load factors to represent site specific truck volume and loadometer (weights) values. These recommended changes lead to more uniform safety levels and fatigue lives for steel bridges.

AB - A method of solving the minimum weight/maximum strength design problem of plane rigid frames under the influence of their self‐weight as well as externally applied forces is described. Each member of the frame attains the maximum allowable normal or shear stress, or both, for the material. Concepts from the differential game theory are used to reduce the corresponding mathematical optimization problem to a minimax variational one. In the first instance, analytical expressions for the optimum shape of typical plane frame members are obtained. These are then combined with a modified stiffness matrix analysis routine to obtain the optimum shape of the plane rigid frame as a whole. The unified method is applicable to a wide variety of plane rigid frames. Several examples are given to demonstrate its potential.

AB - More exact expressions of the fundamental equations of a member with initial imperfections subjected to the action of bending and torsional moments are derived. Since beam problems involve moderately large in‐plane deformation prior to collapse, only nonlinear terms of in‐plane displacement and in‐plane resulting force are considered in the numerical analysis using the transfer matrix method. In the formulation of stress resultants in a partially yielded section, the equivalent section properties are used. The proposed idea is obtained by a transformed‐section method of analysis of reinforced concrete beams. Finally, the effects of initial deformation, initial lateral deflection, residual stress patterns, strain hardening, and load and support conditions on the ultimate strength and deformation behavior of beams are investigated.

AB - A technique is proposed for determining the reliability of redundant ductile framed structures. A nonlinear structural analysis program and incremental load procedure are used to find the limit state function in load space for fixed structural properties. The failure probability of this deterministic structure is then computed by integrating the joint distribution function of loads over the failure region in load space. The procedure is extended to include randomness in the strength of the structure by introducing a random resistance variable unique to each load path. The statistics of this variable can be found by relating magnitudes of the load vector to successive component failure. The load space formulation of system reliability appears applicable to realistic structures of reasonable complexity.

AB - Tube‐in‐tube structures are analyzed using a continuum approach in which the two beams are individually modeled by a “tube beamr” that accounts for flexural deformation, shear deformation, and shear‐lag effect. The beams are forced to have equal lateral deflections, and the amount of load carried by each beam is a function of its relative stiffness. The analyses are performed using the Minimum Potential Energy principle, and the results are compared with results of finite element analyses. It is shown that the continuously compatible condition reasonably models tube‐in‐tube structures with as few as five stories.

AB - Experimental investigations of the force‐deformation behavior of cropped‐web tubular Pratt type truss joints and specimens representing truss compression webs are described. Dimensionless empirical expressions are presented for estimating the strength and flexibility of square‐chord and roundchord joints with end‐cropped webs. Strength and flexibility comparisons are drawn between round‐chord and square‐chord joints. The behavior of isolated joint specimens is compared to that of similar joints in trusses. The influence of chord axial force and secondary bending moment on joint strength is examined. The influence of end‐cropping on effective‐length factors of truss compression webs is demonstrated. A procedure is proposed for designing tubular trusses with end‐cropped webs.

AB - Probabilistic models are proposed for the occurrence, detection, and consequences of human errors in structures. The models are developed in an overall framework of decision theory applied to the problem of allocating control efforts that would narrow the gap between the estimated and actual rates of structural failure. Two models for error occurrence are presented: (1) A binomial distribution for errors in discrete tasks; and (2) a Poisson process for errors occurring in a continuous production interval. Checking is modeled as a sequence of Bernoulli trials. The restrictive independence assumptions implied in the classical use of the preceding distributions are replaced by the weaker and more appropriate assumption of exchangeability, by accounting for the uncertainty regarding distribution parameters. A bivariate probability model is also developed which correlates the performance of a structure to its error content. The aforementioned probabilistic models provide an outline of areas where prior information is needed and a specific format for the collection of additional data. An application to decision‐making in the area of nondestructive testing is also presented.

AB - The effect of axial friction forces on the calculated hoop stress of an unstiffened silo, or of the top unstiffened portion of a silo is analyzed. Ignoring the beam‐column interaction between axial friction forces and radial pressure due to the grain may result in an error of 20% in some cases. This results in a variable actual factor of safety which depends on the geometric characteristics of the silo. An instability analysis is carried out which sets limits on the maximum unstiffened length of a silo. This is done on a probabilistic basis and an algorithm is suggested for the design of an unstiffened silo or a silo stiffened by rings.

AB - An accurate method is described for the determination of the curves of maximum moments for beams loaded with moving loads. This method avoids errors in the range of 15 percent produced by the commonly used approximation techniques. It applies to simple beams and to beams overhanging their supports. The basic idea of the method is to replace each of the moving load systems by a virtual system of stationary loads. The moments and the reactions produced by this virtual system are equal to the maximum moments and to the maximum reactions respectively produced by the actual moving system of loads. Examples of the application of the theory are given for some simple loading conditions.
