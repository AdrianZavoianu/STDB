AB - The most significant advances over the last 15 years relative to the dynamic problems of aerial guideways are summarized. Emphasized are guideways with steel supporting flexural members, designed for the exclusive right‐of‐way of a particular type of vehicle: Steel wheel‐on‐rail, rubber tire or airlevitated. Nondimensional parameters characterizing guideway‐vehicle interactions are catalogued and related to recent designs and current design practice. The role of structural dynamic analysis and the need for further research in the control of both passenger ride quality and airborne noise radiating from elevated guideways are discussed.

AB - This investigation was undertaken to observe the strength and behavior of a one‐half scale, nine panel, flat plate with a banded arrangement of unbonded tendons. The test slab had three 10‐ft spans in each direction and 2.5 ft overhangs on two edges with the nominal thickness measured at 2.75 in. The slab was designed with a low P/A stress level of 135 psi. The overall performance of the test slab at service load level (50 psf) was quite satisfactory. The slab behaved elastically and deflection was fully recovered upon releasing the applied load. The slab before failure was very ductile, with large deflections observed in all tests to failure. The failure load was observed at 160 psf, which was in excess of the designed factored load. The punching shear failure was secondary to the flexural failure; thus, the punching shear load was equal to flexural failure load. The minimum bonded reinforcement of 0.15% of the column strip area provided very good crack control up to the failure load.

AB - A load test of a prestressed concrete, one‐half scale model, flat plate with unbonded tendons is reported. The four panel model was 20 ft (6.1 m) square, 2.75 in. (70 mm) thick, with 8 in. (200 mm) or 7 in. (175 mm) square columns spaced at 10 ft (3 m) centers. A uniform tendon arrangement was used in one slab direction and a banded arrangement was employed in the other direction. Bonded reinforcement was provided in accordance with ACI Code (318‐77) provisions. In addition, deformed bars were used as slab stirrups at several column connections. Bonded reinforcement effectively controlled cracking. The measured tendon stress at ultimate was 10–16% lower than the ultimate stress predicted by the ACI Code (318‐77) equation. Yield‐line analysis results showed good agreement with measured strength. The banded tendon layout successfully supported a load greater than the design ultimate load. Although slab stirrups were ineffective, the shear strength of each slab‐column connection tested exceeded the ultimate strength predicted by the ACI Code. Use of the ACI Code equivalent frame method of analysis was supported for design.

AB - An analytical method is developed to determine the seismic response of rotational shell structures, such as cooling towers, supported by deep foundations in the form of long piles. The substructure deletion method is employed through the development of a dynamic boundary system at the contact area between the superstructure and the substructure. A new mathematical formulation compatible with the shell deformation is developed to deal with the rigid body motions due to the negation of the fixed base assumption. Two pile foundation cases are considered in order to examine the effect of soil‐pilestructure interaction on the seismic response of cooling towers.

AB - The advanced first‐order, second‐moment method was used to examine the relative reliability of dimension lumber in bending for designs made in accordance with the National Design Specification for Wood Construction. System behavior was not included, and the load duration effect was approximated using the existing time‐strength relationship, the “Madison curve.” The species of lumber had an effect on the reliability. For a given grade and size, the reliability indices between certain species differed by more than one unit. The grade of lumber also affected the reliability. Generally, higher grade material exhibited higher reliability indices. One notable exception is No. 1 grade material, which often exhibits relatively low reliability. Increased size (depth) of dimension lumber produced a decrease in the reliability index. Considering lognormal and Weibull 2‐parameter distributions for ultimate bending stress, the reliability is greater for the lognormal distribution assumption. The difference in the reliability index can be as much as one unit.

AB - Post‐buckling, post‐peak, and cyclic behavior of beam‐columns and frames are studied using a computer model developed on the basis of the Finite Segment Method, using generalized cyclic stress‐strain relationships and an automatic load control technique. Numerical examples of structural members and simple frames are made using the computer model. The results are compared with available experimental data as well as the results of simple rigid‐plastic analyses to verify the proposed method.

The individual and coupling effects of various parameters upon the load‐carrying capacity of such frames are fully assessed. The stresses in the chords and lacing bars of the members are also established with satisfactory accuracy. The analysis presented herein is illustrated through a numerical example.

AB - Hurricane Alicia came onshore during the morning of August 18, 1983, and caused significant damage to wood‐framed, elevated, waterfront construction on Galveston Island. Although the hurricane was moderate in nature (category 3 on the Saffir‐Simpson Hurricane Scale), significant damage occurred. This paper examines the damage and outlines possible causes of the damage in the wood‐framed structures on Galveston Island, in particular those structures in the West Beach area. The primary weakness appears to be the connection details. Similar damage caused by other hurricanes has been reported in the past. Current building codes for this type of construction are reviewed. Possible supplements to the codes to help minimize similar damage in the future are presented.

Three cases of side to main span ratios, 0.35, 0.40. and 0.45, were considered for which cable tensions, girder deflections and tower and girder moments were computed. The computational work was done on IBM 360. The stiffness matrix method, treating the bridge as a two‐dimensional structure, was used.

AB - For a given combination of masonry units and mortar, the flexural strength of masonry is dependent on the quality of workmanship, the method of loading, and the number of mortar joints in the span. The weakest link theory is applied to establish the relationship between flexural strength test data obtained for the same materials and workmanship by different loading conditions and sizes of masonry units. The theoretical results are verified by tests on 71 prisms and 23 wall panels.

AB - A semi‐empirical method for the evaluation of the statistical characteristics of the mean, variance and the maximum response peak of a single degree of freedom linear system under seismic action is presented. The nonstationary ground motion is modeled filtering a white Gaussian random noise and enveloping the filtered noise by a deterministic shaping function. The linear differential equations for the determination of the spectral moments are examined and a closed‐form solution given. Extensive studies by means of digital simulation are made and the proposed semi‐empirical formulation is compared with other approximate methods available in the literature within the framework of the first passage problem.
