AB - The accuracy of the response spectrum analysis (RSA) for estimating the maximum response of a building directly from the earthquake design spectrum is evaluated with the objective of developing better simplified analysis procedures which are suitable for preliminary design of buildings. The procedures can also be included in building codes. This paper demonstrates that: (1) For a fixed fundamental period T1 of the building, the response contributions of the higher vibration modes increase, and consequently, the errors in the RSA results increase, with decreasing beam‐to‐column sitffness ratio ρ; (2) for a fixed ρ, the response contributions of the higher vibration modes increase, and consequently, the errors in the RSA results increase, with increasing T1 in the medium‐ and long‐period regions of the design spectrum; and (3) the RSA results are accurate enough for design applications. Based on the results presented in this paper, improved simplified analysis procedures for the preliminary design of buildings are developed in the companion paper.

AB - Recognizing that the earthquake response of many buildings can be estimated by considering only the first two vibration modes in the response spectrum analysis (RSA) procedure a simplified response spectrum analysis (SRSA) procedure is presented. The SRSA method should be very useful in practical application because, although much simpler than the RSA method, it provides very similar estimates of design forces for many buildings. With the development of the SRSA, a hierarchy of four analysis procedures to determine the earthquake forces are available to the building designer: code‐type procedure, SRSA, RSA, and RHA (response history analysis). The criteria presented to evaluate the results from each procedure and to decide whether it is necessary to improve results by proceeding to the next procedure in the hierarchy use all the preceding computations and are, therefore, convenient.

AB - Interaction between a framed structure and the foundation and soil beneath it are known to influence the distribution of load between columns and the differential settlements. Most previous studies of this phenomenon have assumed that the frame is complete before any loading occurs. However in many cases, significant load will be applied progressively during the construction of the frame. This paper examines the effect that such a change from the usual assumption will have on the interaction effects. This problem has been examined both for a plane frame and a three‐dimensional frame, and the relationship between these two sets of results is examined.

AB - The design and proposed construction method for the cable‐stayed steel alternate of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge across Tampa Bay, FL, is outlined in detail. For this alternate, the concept of a relatively new steel composite girder was used. The girder comprises a grid of welded steel plate girders and is topped by a concrete deck from precast slabs. The concrete towers with diamond‐shaped box girder legs are connected to the girder by parallel wire or strand cables. The aerodynamic stability of the girder is greatly enhanced by the cables converging from the ouside of the girder to the tower tops, thus creating a stiff space truss. Although this design lost to the concrete alternate by the small margin of 4%, the concept has gained widespread acceptance. In subsequent competitive biddings, cable‐stayed composite bridges proved to be considerably more economical than concrete or all‐steel options. In the future development of cable‐stayed bridges, designs with composite girders, concrete towers, and parallel strand cables will play an important role.

AB - Shear links employed in Eccentrically Braced Frames (EBFs) must be appropriately stiffened in order to prevent premature web buckling and retain energy dissipation capability for subsequent cyclic loading. Criteria for web stiffener spacing as a function of inelastic cyclic shear link deformation is proposed based on the secant modulus approach applied to 30 tested links. The applications of these criteria to EBF ultimate state design are briefly examined.

AB - The fatigue behavior of partially prestressed concrete beams is investigated in a series of tests of bonded post‐tensioned T‐beams. The beams are simply supported with the same overall dimensions, and designed for the same flexural strength. The main parameter in the study is the degree of prestress (from 0.2–1.0). Eight beams are tested in fatigue: Five beams are subjected to a constant load cycle, while the remaining three beams are subjected to cumulative fatigue loading. All beams are initially cracked before the application of repeated loading. Rapid changes in cracking, deflections, and nonprestressed steel stress occur in the early stages of fatigue loading, and are followed by a stable period until just prior to failure. Cumulative fatigue loading always results in reduced life of the member. Fatigue failure is caused by successive fracturing of the non‐prestressed reinforcement; and no failure of pretensioned reinforcement is observed. Crack spacing approximately coincides with shear reinforcement spacing which is constant in the tests, indicating that the latter spacing may have some effect on spacing of cracks. Based on the test results, it is concluded that at present there is no justification for the use of complicated expressions to predict maximum crack width, and that the simple expression proposed by the CEB‐FIP Code gives satisfactory predictions. It appears that a degree of prestress between 0.4 and 0.6 is optimum for satisfactory cracking and fatigue response.

AB - A finite element method for predicting the inelastic lateral buckling loads of continuous steel beam‐columns is described. A series of tests on three‐span continuous beam‐columns reported elsewhere is studied using the finite element method. The study firstly considers the effects of load shedding and plasticity in the test frame of which the beam‐columns form a part, followed by an analysis of the inelastic lateral buckling of the beam‐columns documented in the experimental study. It is demonstrated that there is extremely good correlation between theory and experiment, suggesting that the finite element method can be used with confidence to study the inelastic lateral buckling of continuous beam‐columns when the effects of elastic restraints and load shedding are present.

AB - A plate or shell element subjected to membrane forces Nx, Ny, Nxy and bending moments Mx, My, Mxy, is considered. Based on equilibrium considerations, equations for capacities of top and bottom reinforcements in two orthogonal directions have been derived. An iterative method is suggested for calculating the design capacities. The proposed equations are more general and rigorous than those derived for membrane reinforcement alone and those for flexure only. For the membrane alone case, the proposed equations degenerate into the previously derived equations. For the latter, it is shown that the present practice of designing flexural reinforcement may underestimate the required capacity.

AB - To investigate the ground motion isolation feasibility, a new brick building system is considered here in which a clear smoothened surface is created at plinth level just above the damp‐proof course, and the superstructure simply rests at this level and is free to slide, except for frictional resistance. Pilot tests carried out on one‐fourth scale brick building models showed large reductions in the roof acceleration compared to conventional fixed‐base models that are subject to shake table motion, indicating a possibility of earthquake isolation. The seismic response of single‐story sliding buildings, subjected to Koyna and El Centro accelerograms, is computed through a two‐mass spring dashpot mathematical model that treats the frictional resistance as rigid plastic. This study leads us to a concept of frictional response spectra, on which the spectral quantities of the sliding system are plotted against the undamped natural period for various coefficients of friction and mass ratios. These spectra clearly show the reduction of response of the sliding system compared to the conventional building.

AB - A numerical description of the fracture processes of concrete which is suitable for use with nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) methods is presented. It is shown that when the rate of the fracture processes of concrete is controlled (e.g., by the use of steel reinforcement), these processes are adequately described by a procedure which allows a crack to occur only at the location where the stress conditions are most critical. Otherwise, the most realistic description is one which allows crack formation at all locations where the criteria for cracking are fulfilled during a given iteration. Furthermore, it is shown that numerical predictions are essentially unaffected by constant values of the shear retention factor (SRF) between 0.10 and 0.50. Simple recommendations are finally presented for the definition of realistic FE meshes and incremental loading procedures.

AB - A procedure is introduced to compute the maximum response of light secondary systems attached to buildings subjected to earthquakes. The procedure is based on the application of the response spectrum technique to a combined building‐attachment system, but it is formulated in terms of the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the independent building and attachment components. Hence, it fully takes into account the interaction between the two components, avoids the solution of large eigenvalue problems, and facilitates the analysis of different secondary systems without the need to reanalyze the supporting building. The procedure is formulated by using Rayleigh's principle and Hurty's component mode synthesis technique. Linear systems with classical modes of vibration, small secondary‐ to primary‐mass ratios, and no more than one point of attachment are considered. In a comparative numerical study the proposed procedure predicts correct solutions with an average error of about 1%.

AB - An analytical investigation using a three‐dimensional finite element model was conducted to study the complex behavior of hollow block prisms under axial compression. Detailed stress distributions in different directions were determined which help in understanding the composite behavior and failure mechanism of both face shell and fully‐bedded mortared prisms. The effects of type of mortar bedding, mortar deformational characteristics, block size, heightto‐thickness ratio, number of mortar joints, and stiffness of bearing plates on the behavior of axially loaded prisms were studied. The results show that the most significant parameters are the type of mortar bedding, the prism geometry, and the stiffness of bearing plates. Recommendations for the determination of masonry compressive strength and evaluations of code provisions for the testing of concrete masonry prisms are presented.

AB - Shelf angles, supporting masonry on a structural frame, deflect due to the weight of the masonry and may also deflect due to differential movement between the masonry and the frame in the absence of an adequate expansion joint between the shelf angle and the masonry. Those deflections induce bending moments and compressive stresses in the masonry, which may be destructive. A method is provided for estimating the magnitude and direction of those moments and forces. The method has been used in masonry failure investigations.
