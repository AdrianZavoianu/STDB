AB - It is demonstrated how the K‐factor concept can give rise to peculiarities that are in direct conflict with the common‐sense approach to design. For example, although a buckling analysis may indicate a K‐value greater than or smaller than 1.0 for a leaning column in an unbraced frame, the designer will always adopt K=1.0 for proportioning such columns. However, the K‐factors obtained from the buckling analysis are the correct values to be included in the moment magnifier expression. The contradictions created by the K‐factor are also apparent in frames with semirigid as well as fully rigid connections. It is proposed that all these anomalies can be eliminated by employing column interaction equations that do not make use of the K‐factor.

AB - Although the quality of welding has improved over the past decades, welding discontinuities are still unavoidable. Welded structures are subjected to inspection codes established by different authorities or professional societies, but the basis of acceptance criteria for weld discontinuities in existing standards appears to be arbitrary and, sometimes, naive. In this paper, the philosophy of “fitness for service” will give a rational approach to new quality acceptance criteria for weldments on the basis of service requirements. A design methodology is developed to characterize the relative strength of the fillet joints containing discontinuities through the definition of “Equivalent Effective Weld Size” and “Design Load Reduction Factor.”

AB - The elastic stiffness of columns is a parameter extensively used for the dynamic and static analysis of bridges. The analytic exact estimation of this parameter is very complicated when the geometry and boundary conditions of the column are complex. In this case, the use of an approximate method and a computer might be necessary for the solution of the problem. In this paper, an analytic method for the exact estimation of the elastic stiffness of columns with a parabolic flare at the top and translational and rotational foundation springs at the bottom is presented. This complicated geometry type of bridge column has been used extensively by bridge engineers in the design of highway bridges. First, the whole method is presented in detail; then all necessary steps for the application of the method are identified and summarized. Finally, the application of the method to the estimation of the elastic stiffness of the columns of a bridge located at Riverside, California, is shown through an illustrative example.

AB - The dynamic responses of Morrow Point Dam to Taft ground motion are presented under various assumptions for the impounded water and foundation rock for a range of properties of the alluvium and sediments at the reservoir boundary. Study of these response results demonstrates that the earthquake response of arch dams is increased by dam‐water interaction and decreased by reservoir boundary absorption, with these effects being more significant in the response of arch dams compared to gravity dams. It is also shown that the magnitudes of these effects depend significantly on the component of ground motion, and that the assumption of a rigid, nonabsorptive reservoir boundary leads to unrealistically large response for dams with impounded water, particularly due to vertical ground motion.

AB - The development and application of an “energy dissipation index” to characterize reinforced concrete beams under cyclic load is described. The index is designed to provide an objective measure of the response of beams with different geometries and reinforcement ratios subjected to severe cyclic loading. The effects of flexural reinforcement, transverse reinforcement, concrete strength, and load history are considered. The index is used to evaluate the results of five major experimental investigations. The energy dissipation index may be applied to both research and design. The analysis of the experimental work shows that to improve the cyclic performance of reinforced concrete beams, it is more efficient to decrease the shear stress, by increasing the beam width, than to increase the transverse reinforcement. The analysis also indicates that increasing the ratio of positive to negative reinforcement may not markedly improve the cyclic performance of a beam. Recommendations are made for the design of reinforced concrete beams that may be subjected to severe cyclic loading.

AB - AASHTO specifications give a load fraction based on only two major variables that affect load distribution on highway bridges. For more economical design, a refinement of the AASHTO values is needed. In this paper, the processes for beam‐and‐slab and box‐girder bridge systems are shown. It is concluded that to make an economical design of a long bridge of moderate span, the accuracy of the transverse load distribution is a key factor. The finite element modeling methods for finding very accurate load distribution normally cannot be used early enough to help the designer at the beginning of the design process. For a multibox bridge, cross‐sectional transverse influence lines can always be developed with relatively short calculations for load distribution and torque.

AB - The observed performance of prototype unanchored cylindrical liquid storage tanks during four past major earthquakes as well as the performance of model cylindrical liquid storage tanks during simulated earthquake conditions is evaluated by correlations between observed tank‐wall damage and damage predictions. These damage predictions are obtained: (1) By using the current design procedures; (2) by an existing empirical tank‐wall earthquake stability coefficient approach; and (3) by a new proposed empirical design approach based also on a tank‐wall earthquake empirical coefficient. From this correlation it is concluded that the proposed approach is more competent in predicting the tank‐wall earthquake damage than the two existing approaches. In this way it can be argued that compliance with this approach may well minimize tank‐wall damage in future strong earth motions.

It is demonstrated that these formulas do not properly recognize the effects of important building parameters, which control the significance of higher mode contributions in the building response. An improved procedure, which recognizes the influence of these parameters, to compute the earthquake forces for the initial, preliminary design of buildings will be presented in a companion paper.

AB - Simple strength of material relationships are used to determine the membrane forces acting on a symmetrically loaded concrete or steel box girder bridge. The longitudinal membrane force Nxx is found by treating the box girder as a beam. The membrane shear force Nxy is found by differentiating Nxx with respect to x (longitudinal direction) and integrating with respect to y (transverse direction). The transverse membrane force Nyy is found by further differentiating Nxx with respect to x and integrating with respect to y. A numerical example shows how the equations derived can be applied to a practical example.

AB - A theory regarding the stresses of reinforced concrete shear walls and slabs under service loads is presented. Stresses are determined before and after cracking. The reinforcement provides forces and moments that compose tensors. These tensors, together with the corresponding concrete tensors, constitute the reinforced concrete tensors. After cracking, the force and moment tensors of reinforcement appear in their complete form, i.e., not only with the axial forces but also with the shear forces of steel bars. The existence of these shear forces is proved theoretically, and their magnitude is determined by the compatibility conditions of the strains at the crack. Equating the tensor of the internal forces or moments of plate with the tensor of reinforced concrete forces or moments, respectively, we obtain the angle of cracks, the steel stresses and the forces or moments of concrete between the cracks. Derived equations are applied to plates reinforced with an orthogonal reinforcing net or with reinforcing bars in one direction. Experimental and theoretical results show a very good agreement.

AB - Economical restrained end reinforced concrete T‐sections are established using an optimization routine and the strength design procedure. The objective function includes the in‐place cost of formwork, concrete, longitudinal reinforcement, stirrup reinforcement, and depth‐related costs. The continuous function design variables are the beam stem width, effective depth, areas of tension and compression reinforcement, and percentages of support moment redistribution. Linear and nonlinear continuous functions are applied to establish side and behavorial constraints. The behavorial constraints include the nominal moment and shear strengths at critical locations and deflection limitations. Comparisons of optimum beam designs, obtained by changing a particular design parameter, are made to indicate design sensitivity. These parameter studies show the individual effects of allowable deflection, material strengths, support continuity, and unit material cost variation. The paper concludes with guidelines for economical T‐sections that are based on the results of the parameter sensitivity studies.

AB - A numerical method is presented for the dynamic response analysis of large structural systems that are modeled as substructures. The method is similar to the component mode synthesis technique; however, the generation of the substructure modes is very efficient since the eigenvectors of the substructures are not evaluated. In addition, the characteristics of the loading are used in the algorithm, which can result in improved accuracy with the use of fewer vectors. The purpose of the method is to efficiently evaluate the dynamic displacements and forces within complex structures subjected to a particular type of loading. The technique does produce approximate modeshapes and frequencies; however, this is not the basic purpose of the method. The efficiency and accuracy of the method has previously been demonstrated for the direct dynamic analysis of complete structures. In this paper the method is extended to systems of substructures in which local substructure Ritz vectors are used to reduce the number of dynamic degrees of freedom. The basic algorithm is summarized for substructure application and simple examples are studied by the use of different models.

AB - Galloping of power line conductors is a random phenomenon. Its randomness is characterized by several random variables including wind speed, wind direction, ice shape, wind angle of attack, ice thinness, span length, conductor size, galloping amplitude, the number of loops per span, time of day, geographical location, and so on. In spite of years of research, many mathematical studies, wind tunnel tests, considerable field experience, the notion of correctly observing and interpreting the actual galloping event remains a challenge. The objectives of the proposed methodology are to reduce the field observations to a binary (on-off) choice, establish quantitative measures of probability based on binary statistics, reduce the number of observations required for the proof (or disproof) of a particular device, and apply the methodology of binary statistics to the galloping problem.

AB - This note reports results of two tests performed on full-scale thin-walled prestressed concrete beams where the increase in external load is caused by changing the water level contained in the beam section. The purpose of the experiments was to contrast experimental values of the buckling load with predictions based on a numerical model of the problem, which had anticipated a buckling load significantly lower than the classical lateral torsional buckling load associated with solid-type loading. Experimental results confirm the validity of the theoretical model.

AB - The adjoint method has been used in structural optimization to compute sensitivity coefficients of cost and constraint functions with respect to design parameters. The adjoint method involves the calculation of an adjoint vector from certain adjoint equations. So far, the adjoint equations have been considered only as a numerical tool for computing sensitivity coefficients. In this paper, the adjoint equations are given a physical interpretation, and it is shown that the components of the adjoint vector are the influence coefficients associated with the given function. Importantly, the interpretation of adjoint equations in this paper provides a new method for obtaining influence coefficients.

AB - When a simply supported bridge is treated by the usual method of calculation, where its different plane surfaces are considered to act independently of each other, settlement of one of its bearings does not create any additional stresses. However, if the same bridge is treated as a space structure, where all carrier surfaces act together to resist all loads, settlement of one of the bearings will give rise to additional stresses in all surfaces of the bridge. The carrying surfaces method treats bridges as space structures and is used to calculate the additional stresses introduced in a simply supported bridge with different angles of skew, due to a settlement of one of its supports.

AB - An iterative search technique has been followed to find the minimum weigh plastic design of nonuniform, builtup steel I-beams or girders continuous over two or three symmetrical spans. The unstiffened web has a parabolic profile with identical top and bottom flange areas that are varied at locations of maximum positive and negative moment. Only uniformly distributed loading is considered to simplify mathematical formulation. The influence of some significant design variables on the optimum design is highlighted.
