AB - The aggregate interlock mechanism gives a substantial contribution to the shear resistance of reinforced or prestressed concrete thin‐webbed beams, which are characterized by mostly linear, closely spaced, thin diagonal cracks at the onset of shear failure. Under these circumstances, the aggregate interlock effects can be adequately described by resorting to one of the few available models for aggregate interlock, such as the so‐called rough crack model, which is adopted here. On the assumption that the beam behaves like a plane truss, with shear and confinement stresses along the diagonal cracks, it is possible to determine the aggregate interlock contribution to the shear resistance and the necessary degree of shear reinforcement by solving a system of equations regarding the equilibrium of the truss, the stirrup‐to‐concrete compatibility, and the constitutive laws of the aggregate interlock, the solid concrete between the shear cracks, and the crack spacing. Results are obtained for different stirrup diameters and concrete strengths. Comparisons are made with CEB and ACI code provisions.

AB - Shear lag and negative shear lag effect in cantilever box girders are analyzed through a variation approach and finite element techniques. The complex distribution of bending stresses under symmetrical loading on the flanges of cellular sections are also presented. In this paper, the supposition of the spanwise displacement on flanges follows a quartic parabolic variation. However, expressions are derived to determine the region of negative shear lag effect with the interrelation of span/width parameters involved. The theoretical results thus obtained are compared with a plexiglass model test. Finally, conclusions are drawn with regard to further study and research.

AB - Theoretical stress analyses of thin glass plates are applied to monolithic and layered (two plates with no connection) systems to establish limits of behavior for laminated (two plates with interlayer) systems. Behaviors of monolithic and layered systems are related by a “strength factor,” which establishes a ratio between maximum stresses in monolithic systems and those in comparable layered systems. Under some conditions of geometry and lateral pressure this ratio exceeds 1.0.

AB - Circumferentially slotted bolt hole connections, a new concept for corrugated metal culverts, have proven to be effective in reducing thrust stress (ring compression) in deep embankment installations. Pragmatically, this means that slotted‐joint culverts can be buried deeper than standard‐joint culverts or lighter gage metal can be used. However, because of the present lack of design tables and guidelines, this economical innovation has far from researched its full application potential. In an attempt to fill this need, this paper offers a complete design method employing an experimentally verified culvert‐joint‐soil system model with analytical solutions along with a set of realistic design criterion. The design method is used to generate a sequence of design tables for 6×2‐in. corrugated steel pipes with slotted joints, in which the tables specify the maximum allowable fill height cover as a function of pipe diameter, wall thickness (gage), and soil stiffness. It is concluded that, even though the design method is conservative, the slotted‐joint pipes can, in some cases, sustain fill heights more than twice that of standard pipes if high structural quality soil is used.

AB - Both static and dynamic tests were carried out on an old reinforced concrete bridge prior to its demolition. The purpose of the static test was to calibrate the mathematical model used in the structural analysis. By comparing deflections, the restraining moments at the supports were estimated. This revised mathematical model was used to calculate the natural frequencies of the bridge deck and the results compared reasonably well with the measured frequencies from the dynamic tests. The study demonstrates the importance of making appropriate assumptions about the boundary conditions in an analysis. Whether these assumed conditions are realized in the prototype is a major factor affecting the accuracy of the predicted behavior of the bridge deck.

AB - The full, 12×12, stiffness matrix of a free‐standing helicoidal stair is constructed in terms of its geometric characteristics. Knowledge of this stiffness matrix allows incorporation of the stair as a single element into a 3‐dimensional model of a reinforced concrete building structure, for lateral load analysis. The elements of the stiffness matrix that affect the most the lateral stiffness of the structural system are presented in terms of the following geometric parameters: story height, axis inclination, opening angle in plan, and width and depth of the stairslab. For given story height, the magnitude of these elements is found to depend strongly only on the depth of the stairslab and on the opening angle of the stair. The lateral stiffness of the stair in any horizontal direction is found to be almost negligible for opening angles between 270° and 360°, but becomes quite significant for angles less than 180°. The reduction of stiffness due to axial and shear deformations of the stair is, generally, very small.

AB - Estimates of the limit state probability for wood members, where the limit state is failure by creep rupture, must be based on analyses that take into account the temporal characteristics of the applied loads. These estimates require: (1) construction of appropriate load process models; (2) a probabilistic description of wood member strength; and (3) a cumulative damage analysis. Reliability analyses of beams subjected to dead, snow, and live loads were performed to evaluate the effects of using different load duration models and different parameters in the snow and live load process models. It was found that the most important factor determining failure is the duration and magnitude of the extreme load pulses. The choice of load duration model, in contrast, was relatively unimportant. Reliabilities associated with existing design criteria were evaluated, and resistance factors for use in a proposed load and resistance factor design format were determined, using glulam beams in bending as an example.

AB - Current design rules for wood columns are reviewed, and a linear elastic analysis of pin‐ended built‐up columns with timber connectors concentrated near the ends is presented. The analysis shows how stresses, deflections, and buckling loads depend on individual member properties, joint stiffnesses, overall geometry, and how the load is applied. Particular results are presented for a column made from two pieces of lumber joined together at the ends with nails and with the axial load all applied to one piece of lumber. Spaced columns are also covered, and a conclusion is that current design rules are very conservative with long‐spaced columns with nailed joints requiring 10% of the joint capacities specified by the National Design Specification for Wood Construction.

AB - A complete constitutive relationship for the time‐independent nonlinear behavior of reinforced concrete is presented. The nonlinear features include the inelastic responses of concrete and steel reinforcements, prediction of concrete fracture under multiaxial stress states, and post‐failure behavior of fractured concrete. Moreover, the interaction effects between concrete and steel rebars are included in finite element stiffness calculations by considering tension stiffening and shear transferring due to dowel actions. The constitutive relationship was implemented into a nonlinear finite element program to investigate the deformation behavior of four reinforced concrete panels. Numerical results obtained from the finite element analysis are compared favorably with the available experimental data.

AB - A parametric investigation was conducted to determine the significance of selected structural and ground motion parameters on dynamic inelastic response of coupled wall structures. Structural parameters include: fundamental period, wall strength, beam‐to‐wall stiffness and strength ratios, coupling arm, clear beam span, gravity loads, and structure mass. Ground motion parameters include: earthquake frequency characteristics, duration, and intensity. A computer program and a moment‐rotation hysteretic model, including the effects of axial force‐flexure interaction, was used to conduct nonlinear dynamic analyses. Significance of each parameter on maximum force and ductility response is shown. The most significant parameters are identified as design variables. Relationships between design variables and response quantities are established.

AB - The buckling of a column, clamped at both ends and with an interior hinge is studied. It is shown that the buckling load of a column with an interior hinge depends on the location of the hinge. The optimum location of a hinge (for maximum buckling strength) is 21.9% of the total length from one end for a clamped-clamped column (a decrease of only 11% from the no-hinge load). For a clamped-pinned column, the optimal hinge location is 30.1% from the clamped end without any decrease in buckling load.
