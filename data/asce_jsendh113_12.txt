AB - The softening postpeak load‐deflection relation for cracking reinforced concrete beams and frames is analyzed by layered finite elements. Concrete is assumed to exhibit strain softening in both tension and compression, and the steel reinforcement is elastic‐plastic. The bending theory assumptions are used and bond slip of reinforcement is neglected. It is shown that the model can satisfactorily approximate the existing test results for softening beams and frames. At the same time, the constitutive laws with strain softening, including those of continuum damage mechanics, are shown to lead to spurious sensitivity of results to the chosen finite element size, similar to that documented before for other strain‐softening problems. In analogy to the finite element crackband model, this problem can be overcome if the minimum admissible element size is specified as a cross section property; its suitable value appears to be equal to the beam depth.

AB - A layered finite element model with strain‐softening material properties, whose applicability to reinforced concrete was corroborated by comparisons with experimental data in the preceding paper, is used in a parametric study aimed at the effect of several factors: structure size, finite element size, downward slope of strain‐softening stress‐strain relation, length of the plastic yield plateau before the onset of strain softening (if any), and end‐restraint stiffness. To quantify the response, several new response characteristics are introduced: the ductile strengthening factor, characterizing how strain softening reduces the maximum load compared to the plastic limit load; the redistribution ratio, characterizing the degree of bending moment redistribution in comparison to that in plastic limit analysis; the energy safety factor, describing the energy to deform the structure to the peak load; and the ductility factor, characterizing the deflection increase at maximum load relative to the deflection from elastic analysis. The condition of snapback instability, which determines the ductility factor, is derived analytically for an elastically restrained beam. Finally, it is shown that strain‐softening segments in beams cannot be modeled as softening hinges except for sufficiently slender beams.

AB - An analysis based on linear and nonlinear finite element computer models of headed anchor bolts epoxied in place in hardened concrete is presented. Two failure theories, the maximum tensile stress criteria and the Mohr‐Coulomb criteria, are applied to the hardened concrete. An approximate expression is developed to predict the ultimate tensile strength of the anchorage system. Results obtained through this analysis are compared to previously reported experimental data.

AB - With modern computational means, the use of deterministic methods to predict the aerodynamic behavior of structures is becoming an attractive alternative to frequency domain methods. Wind speed samples can be generated by various techniques and fed into the system's equations of motion. The use of deterministic approaches, however, requires the artificial wind to be realistic and the simulation technique efficient. A study is undertaken to investigate the merits and drawbacks of commonly used simulation techniques. The latter can be divided into two classes, i.e., wave superposition methods and methods based on linear filtering. Techniques for simulating single and multiple time series are reviewed. Artificial wind speed is generated, and the respective responses calculated. The effects on the response of the simulated samples' different statistical properties are investigated. Results show that dynamic response is affected by the intrinsic characteristics of simulated fluctuations and their degree of correlation. Linear filters are computationally more advantageous and, in general, lead to larger response parameters compared with wave superposition methods. The use of autoregressive‐type simulation methods is recommended.

AB - The structural advantages and aesthetics of a triangular cross‐section truss have long been recognized by structural engineers and architects alike. Until recently, however, it has not been considered cost‐effective to design and build this system over the traditional rectangular or two‐dimensional truss to carry heavy loadings. But with recent advances in welding techniques, the use of computer analysis methods, and the increased availability of structural tubing for truss members, the triangular cross‐section truss has seen a wide range of new applications. This paper discusses the analysis and design of this type of truss to carry highway loadings. The structural analysis program TRUSS1 by the writer, is used for the analysis and design of various truss configurations. Several primary bracing, sway bracing, and truss depth configurations are investigated, and final selection for design is based on least weight criteria. The final design conforms to the current American Association df State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) bridge specifications. The design deals with member selection considering buckling and stress constraints, joint design, and deflection criteria.

AB - Two types of free‐standing stairs, each having an axis that makes a 180° turn in plan, are considered. In the first, the horizontal projection of the axis consists of a central semicircle and two equal straight parts, and in the second, it consists of a straight central part and one quarter‐circle at each end. The internal forces of the stair are expressed in terms of the force vector at its top, and its full (12×12) stiffness matrix is constructed in terms of the geometric parameters of the stair. The symmetry of the stair makes it possible to simplify considerably the stiffness matrix and to express all of the elements of the latter in terms of only 13 independent ones. The elements of the stiffness matrix that have the greatest impact on the lateral stiffness of the building structure are presented in terms of the geometric parameters of the stair. In general, for given story height, the magnitude of these elements decreases considerably, only with an increase in the stair‐slab depth and a reduction of the length of the central portion of the stair, in favor of that of the end portions. Axial and shear deformations of the stair slab have a negligible influence on its lateral stiffness.

AB - An analytical and experimental investigation is carried out into the deformational behavior and strength of reinforced steel‐fiberconcrete (RSFC) beams in flexure. Explicit expressions are derived for the moment‐curvature (M‐ϕ) and load‐deflection (P‐δ) behavior of simply supported beams based on idealized stress‐strain relationships for the steel‐fiber concrete (SFC) and the reinforcing steel. It is shown that RSFC beams with reinforcement have increased flexural strength and ductility at ultimate load when compared to similarly concrete beams with normal reinforcement only. RSFC beams also show less deformation than similar plain reinforced concrete ones at the same load level. Analytically predicted M‐ϕ and P‐δ curves are compared and found to agree well with the experimental data. The present approach is thus a useful tool in the analytical study and design of RSFC members.

AB - In a severe windstorm, some houses survive while others are damaged or destroyed. A first impression of this apparent selectivity is often that the storm possesses peculiar powers. The meteorological facts behind severe winds are examined. Windspeeds are translated into structural loads, and these loads are compared with strengths of some common and upgraded roof connections. It is shown that the strength of common connections may intersect various wind‐speed probability curves in the steepest part of these curves. This implies that slight changes in connection strength can provide large changes in the structural reliability of the connections.

AB - The validity of an interaction formula, based on distortion energy principles, in the design of nonprismatic glulam members is examined. The distortion energy distributions in various nonprismatic members tested to date are determined by utilizing an orthotropic trapezoidal finite element method of analysis. The distortion energy at the location of failure initiation in all the test specimens was found to be significantly lower than that at the critical location on the tapered edge. In full‐scale members failing in radial tension, the distortion energy at these two locations was found to differ by a factor ranging from 12 to 23, and in those members failing in bending, the factor ranged from 1.5 to 7. In double‐tapered members, the redistribution of stresses caused by the apex was found to result in low distortion energy levels throughout the apex region, and failures triggering in this region cannot be attributed to distortion energy reaching a threshold value. The use of a distortion‐energy‐based strength criterion for nonprismatic glulam members is not supported by the results of this study, nor by the observed ultimate behavior of the members tested to date.

AB - An interaction analysis has been conducted to study the effects of a local loss of support beneath the beam footing of a two‐bay plane frame. The results of the study indicate that the magnitude of increase in the bending moment and axial force in the structure due to the presence of a void are dependent, not only on the extent of support loss, but also on the relative stiffnesses between foundation beam and soil, and between superstructure and soil. The increase in bending moment even for a void span of 1/12 of the foundation beam length can become so significant as to exceed the safety provisions. The study shows that the effect of a void on the superstructure moments can be greatly minimized by a combination of rigid foundation and flexible superstructure.

AB - The paper examines the extent to which a procedure for calculating equivalent one-minute loads on glass panels developed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) is consistent with results of destructive tests recently reported by the Ontario Research Foundation (ORF). The ORF tests were conducted on 107 annealed float glass panels with dimensions 1.52m × 2.43m × 6mm, simply supported on four sides. The loading rates ranged from about 0.0025kPa/s to about 25kPa/s, and the times to failure ranged from about 920s to about 0.1s. To check the validity of the NBS procedure, it is noted that if the ORF panels had been tested to failure under constant loads with one minute duration, one should expect the means and the standard deviations of the loads to be the same for various samples—to within sampling errors consistent with the sample sizes. The same should therefore be true of calculated values. Results of statistical tests are presented, from which it can be concluded with high confidence that the validity of the NBS procedure is confirmed by the ORF tests.

AB - Further web crippling tests on rectangular hollow section members have been recently undertaken, with compressive loads transverse to the chord axis applied by full-width, welded branch members. These test data have covered extreme parametric ranges for rectangular hollow section bearing conditions, and supplements the existing limited experimental data. Using all test evidence now available, an assessment is made of the current American Welding Society design provisions for matched connections of box sections. Some rationalization of these design rules is proposed, and an alternative approach to design for web crippling, which is compatible with recent code revisions for web strength in wide-flange or I sections, is also suggested.
