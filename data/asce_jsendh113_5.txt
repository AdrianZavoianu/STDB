AB - The nonlinear behavior and the ultimate strength of four plane counterstressed cable trusses and a hyperbolic paraboloid network have been studied, considering the effects of large deformations, slackening of members, and inelastic material properties. The influence of various combinations of symmetric and asymmetric load distributions on the behavior of these structures is examined, and interaction curves corresponding to the initial slackening and the ultimate strength of the structures are presented.

AB - This paper summarizes the results of a research program conducted during 1980–1985 to develop probability‐based analysis and design procedures for structures in nuclear plants. Limit states of concrete containments and shear walls are formulated. Probabilistic models for static and dynamic loads and structural resistance variables are established. Reliability analysis methods are established for estimating limit state probabilities for nuclear plant structures subjected to combinations of static and dynamic loads. Practical probability‐based design criteria are developed for concrete containments and shear walls in a load and resistance factor design format. The load and resistance factors are illustrated for several limit states and target limit state probabilities.

AB - Mathematical programming techniques are used for the solution of a comprehensive optimal design problem formulation. The formulation, based on American codes of practice, includes constraints related to service, ultimate, and collapse limit states, as well as relevant technological constraints. Solutions to the nonlinear programming problem are obtained with an appropriate computer program, OPTIMAL. This is used for solving a wide range of typical flat plate designs with varying span‐to‐depth ratios, live loads, cable layouts, limit states, and allowable tension stresses. A related sensitivity study enables the comparison of optimal and standard solutions based on the following parameters: (1) Rate of equivalent prestressing and total external load; (2) average concrete stress in compression; (3) active design constraints; (4) material costs; (5) dead to total external load ratio; (6) reinforcement index; and (7) partial prestressing ratio. Some areas of possible improvement of current standard procedures are identified.

AB - The earthquake responses of an arch dam are presented for a range of values of the Younǵs modulus of the dam, three different width‐to‐height ratios, and two values of the dam thickness. Study of these response results demonstrates that: the key parameter that determines the significance of water compressibility in the earthquake response of arch dams is Ωr, the ratio of the fundamental resonant frequency of the water in the infinite channel of the reservoir to that of the dam alone; the effects of water compressibility become insignificant for the larger values of Ωr; but for most dams, the Ωr value is smaller and thus these effects should be considered in their earthquake response analysis.

AB - Methods of predicting the load‐deformation response of orthogonally reinforced concrete slab elements subjected to pure torsional moments in the reinforcement directions are presented. Uncracked, cracked, and ultimate behavior are discussed, treating the reinforcement as linearly elastic‐perfectly plastic and using linear, nonlinear (parabolic), and perfectly plastic stress‐strain relationships for the concrete. The softening effect of the transverse tensile strains on the response of concrete in compression is taken into account by adopting an empirical expression derived from tests on reinforced concrete panels subjected to membrane forces. It is shown that this softening effect has a significant influence on both stiffness and strength and that a yield‐line approach may considerably overestimate the ultimate torsional resistance.

AB - Results of torsion tests to failure on nine orthogonally reinforced concrete slab elements are described and compared with various theoretical predictions. The specimens had dimensions of 200mm×1,700mm×1,700mm(8in.×67in.×67in.). Geometrical reinforcement ratios ranged from 0.25–1.0%. Post‐cracking behavior of the specimens, was accurately predicted by nonlinear analyses that take the softening of the concrete response in compression due to transverse tensile straining into account. Cracked linear response analyses provided very good approximations. Ultimate resistances were between 5–46% below yield‐line theory predictions. However, they were closely predicted by a lower‐bound limit analysis approach with an assumed effective concrete compressive strength equal to 45% of the measured uniaxial compressive strength. Observed peak moments exceeded ultimate resistance predictions based on the torsion design provisions of the current American building code requirements for reinforced concrete by 8%–117%. Except for one specimen that failed at a load 9% less than predicted, Canadian code predictions of the ultimate resistances were exceeded by 3–41%.

The nonlinear dynamic response and accompanying statistical analyses are computed using simulation for a vriety of single‐degree‐of‐freedom frames. These analyses provide benchmarks against which theoretical results may be compared. Reliability measures computed in this study are compared to those determined previously using equivalent static limit states, and the implications for probability‐based safety checking are described.

AB - The capability of rough cracks in concrete to transmit significant amounts of shear has been well recognized for the past few decades. In spite of extensive analysis and experimentation of interface shear, general constitutive models relating shear and normal stresses to corresponding displacements are scarce. A constitutive model for shear transfer (crack stiffness matrix) is desirable for the finite element modeling as well as for modeling mixed mode fracture problems. It is difficult to formulate the relation between stresses and displacements when all four parameters change during the test. To simplify the problem, normal and shear stresses were decoupled during testing in the study reported here. From the test data, expressions were formulated for shear stress versus slip and slip versus dilation at constant normal stresses. Coupling was incorporated by relating normal stresses to peak shear stresses by means of a “failure surface.” Using the proposed crack stiffness matrix formulation, the predicted values were satisfactorily compared with the data of other tests where normal and shear stresses were coupled. The proposed model assumes total deformation theory. Unloading is not considered.

The analytical expressions are based on an approximate model of the distortional buckling mode. Simplified expressions are developed to allow explicit evaluation of the distortional buckling stress by designers. The simplified expressions are compared with an accurate finite strip analysis to check the validity and range of applicability. A simple design example is included in the study.

AB - The reliability of dimension lumber in tension or bending is examined using advanced first‐order second‐moment reliability analyses. The material strength data are obtained from the literature. The reliability index for existing designs ranges from 1.1 to 3.7 for both bending and tension. Load combinations from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) A58.1 are considered. The load‐duration effect is included by applying the appropriate Madison curve value to the resistance, considering that load in the load combination that was at its lifetime maximum value. A load‐ and resistance‐factor design (LRFD) procedure for dimension lumber in bending or tension is then calibrated to existing design practice. Due to the wide range of reliability indices, the selection of a target reliability index is not possible at this time. Rather, a direct calibration approach is used to obtain a single resistance factor for bending or tension. The use of this resistance factor in combination with the load factors and load combinations from ANSI A58.1 is examined. For a given species, grade, and size, the reliability levels over a load combination are made more consistent. However, this direct calibration approach retains the inconsistent levels of safety, which now exist in the NDS between the various species, grades, and sizes. The technique might be useful for a first (lateral) calibration from the current National Design Specification for Wood Construction (NDS) to an LRFD‐based NDS, but future work toward more consistent safety levels would still be in order. The technique might also be useful for calibration of species where little in‐grade test data are available.

AB - Two 1/3‐scale four‐story RC coupled wall subassemblies and a 1/5‐scale seven‐story complete RC frame‐wall building are subjected to simulated seismic loads to failure. Each specimen represents a different case of seismic design. While design of one of the coupled wall subassemblies is in complete accord with the Uniform Building Code (UBC), the other specimens possess less flexural reinforcement than required by this code. The most important test responses of these specimens at service, damage and failure limit states are reviewed and compared. The mechanisms which led to inadequate or satisfactory seismic performance are identified. The observed test responses are related to the provisions and considerations which prevailed in their design. All RC specimens exhibit excellent serviceability and damageability limit state responses. They indicate substantial overstrengths with respect to code‐anticipated values. Specimens which were designed conceptually, but which possess less flexural reinforcement than required by the code, are judged to exhibit better failure limit state performance. Many limitations of the specimens and the manners in which they were tested, however, are noted making it difficult to extend the observations and conclusions from the tests to cover broad groups of structures.
