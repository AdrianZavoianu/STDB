AB - This is the first of a two‐part paper on the development and preliminary testing of a methodology for the optimal probabilistic limit states design of seismic‐resistant steel frames. A mechanism for allowing a designer to include the effects of uncertainties and multiple design objectives in the design process is described. The concept of [GOOD, BAD] and [HIGH, LOW] preference pairs is explained. Scaling procedures for combining the aforementioned effects and the statistics of frame response in a single design entity called designer dissatisfaction are developed. The features of the proposed design method are demonstrated via the design of a simple one‐story shear building.

AB - This is the second part of a two‐part paper on the development and preliminary testing of a methodology for the optimal probabilistic limit states design of seismic‐resistant steel frames. Part two illustrates the design of a three‐story, single‐bay, moment‐resistant steel frame using a computer‐aided design system called DELIGHT.STRUCT. Linear and non‐linear time history analyses are built into the design procedure itself rather than serving as a check at the end of the design process. The frame's performance is assessed on the basis of its statistical response to gravity loads alone, gravity loads plus a family of moderate earthquakes, and, finally, gravity loads combined with an ensemble of rare severe earthquake ground motions. Design objectives include the frame volume, minimum story drifts and maximum hysteretically dissipated energy. The Phase I–II–III Method of Feasible Directions is used to solve the constrained optimization problem for an optimal design that balances the attributes of minimum volume, minimum story drifts and maximum dissipated energy in a desirable way.

AB - In the case of designing many different bridges in open space, it is very difficult to produce a series of well‐balanced bridges, even for those engineers who have a sense of beauty. An aesthetic design method is presented to overcome this difficulty. It is found that a morphological analogy between the stone path in the traditional Japanese garden and a series of different bridges provides a key to solving the problem, and the rule that is used in the harmonic stone path is essentially the same as the principle of the design in question. The essence of the creation is explained analytically and the process of the designing is shown concretely. The proposed method is applied to the actual design planning of Honshu‐Shikoki bridges on the Kojima‐Sakaide route, which is now under construction. Several new forms of piers and bridge towers designed with the proposed method are compared to the ordinary ones planned by the Honshu‐Sikoku Bridge Authority in the early stage of the designing.

AB - A two‐stage procedure was proposed in 1978 for the analysis phase of elastic design and safety evaluation of concrete gravity dams: (1) A simplified analysis procedure in which the response due only to the fundamental vibration mode is estimated directly from the earthquake design spectrum; and (2) a refined response history analysis procedure for finite element idealizations of the dam monolith. The former was recommended for the preliminary design and safety evaluation of dams, and the latter for accurately computing the dynamic response and checking the adequacy of the preliminary evaluation. In this paper, the simplified analysis procedure has been extended to include the effects of dam‐foundation rock interaction and of reservoir bottom sediments, in addition to the effects of dam‐water interaction and water compressibility included in the earlier procedure. Also included now in the simplified procedure is a “static correction” method to consider the response contributions of the higher vibration modes. Thus, the design procedure proposed in 1978, which is still conceptually valid, should utilize the new simplified analysis procedure.

AB - Many uncertainties are associated with the selection of the design earthquake for a particular structure. In an attempt to address such problems, a ten‐story steel frame is designed for the lateral force requirements in current building codes. Two variations of the designed frame are subjected to representative ground motions recorded during the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake. Evaluation of the nonlinear dynamic response of the designed frames indicates that ground motions resulting from the same earthquake may have significant variations in dynamic characteristics. One of the more significant of these are long‐duration acceleration pulses. Results indicate that the nonlinear response of structures to this type of motion is particularly sensitive to the pulse duration relative to the fundamental period of the structure and to the pulse acceleration relative to the yield resistance seismic coefficient of the designed structure.

AB - This paper deals with a study which was made of the load‐deflection relationships of profiled sandwich panel roof cladding. A series of measurements were made on the cladding loaded by air bags to give a uniform pressure. A theoretical method based on the observed deflection characteristics of the cladding is suggested, which makes it possible to calculate the flexural stiffness and deflection of the cladding in a reasonably simple way. The observed deflection pattern is described together with the results of the tests and the predictions of the theoretical method. A reasonable agreement is demonstrated between the measured and predicted results.

AB - The linear approximate expression for the Cm factor used in the American Institute of Steel Construction's 1986 load and resistance factor design specification is derived on the basis of an in‐plane elastic beam‐column analysis. This expression is assumed to be conservative for the design of beamcolumns in the inelastic range, in plane and in space. In this paper, the validity of these assumptions is examined closely for box‐ and I‐shaped cross sections under uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. It is found that the linear expression Cm=0.6-0.4(M1/M2) without the condition Cm⩾0.4 is valid for beamcolumns in plane and in space, and provides a close approximation to the exact results based on the inelastic analysis of an imperfect beam‐column, just as that based on the elastic analysis does.

AB - Tubular members in offshore installations are often subjected to the simultaneous action of axial forces, bending moments, and hydrostatic pressure. Thus, the interactions of forces, moments, and external pressure must be considered in the design of these members. In this study, sectional capacities of tubular members under the action of combined loads are determined by using various failure criteria, and the results are then compared with those obtained from a recent test for short tubular steel columns. In examining the influence of hydrostatic pressure, cap‐end forces are not included explicitly. For most short tubular steel members of dimensions typically used in offshore construction, the failure mechanism may be characterized by the yielding of the material, followed by a buckling in the plastic or strain‐hardening region. Strengths of these members may be predicted by simple equations that are derived from either von Mises or Tresca yield criteria. However, when the members are subjected to relatively high hydrostatic pressure, elastic or inelastic buckling, caused by the presence of residual stresses, may occur before the yield stress is reached.

AB - The general torsional boundary conditions are considered for the steel beam‐frame structures with I‐ and C‐shaped cross sections. The algorithm is originated for the stress analyses of beams with generalized torsional boundary conditions and torsional loadings. This algorithm is utilized for analyses with microcomputers. In addition to the first degree of deformation compatibility (so‐called “effect of framing participation”), the second degree is introduced—compatibility of warping deformations for the frame joints. The numerical example of the frame in bending shows significant discrepancies in the normal and shear stresses calculated by existing standard computer programs and by exact solution for this frame. Along with the exact method of frame analysis which involves the generalized slope‐deflection method, an approximate method of frame analysis, the method of identical joint rotations (MIJR), is proposed and compared with the exact solution. MIJR can be used with the existing standard computer programs.

AB - Transverse shear force effects on the stress and strain distributions of post‐tensioned, rectangular, concrete anchorage blocks were studied, for both concentrically and eccentrically prestressed anchorage zones. From the three‐dimensional, isoparametric finite element model used, it was found that the peak lateral bursting stress in the beam width direction is always higher and nearer to the loaded face of the concrete than the peak transverse bursting stress in the direction of the beam height. Experimental verification involved the use of three‐dimensional, embeddable, strain gage tripods, fabricated to measure the interior concrete strains in the anchorage blocks of fifteen beams subjected to transverse shear loadings up to failure. The measured strains were compared with the analytical strain curves and strain contours given by the three‐dimensional finite element model, and found favorable. It was also found that the transverse shear load reduces the peak transverse bursting strain, but has little effect on the peak lateral bursting strain. The test ultimate transverse loads compared well with the respective theoretical loads, with a mean value of 1.10.

AB - A numerical and experimental study of the collapse and postcollapse behavior of shallow lattice domes is presented. The numerical analysis is based on an updated Lagrangian, materially and geometrically nonlinear, displacement‐based finite‐element program. The formulation incorporated in the program can detect plasticity, instability, and finite deflection effects in the dome structure. Warping effects are ignored. The solution of the nonlinear stiffness equations is designed so that critical points on the equilibrium path are identified in the results. A method is used to obtain the lowest bifurcation path of a perfect lattice dome, once it is established that there is a bifurcation point on its primary equilibrium path. Limit point behavior is detected automatically. A shallow model dome was tested experimentally in a purpose‐built test rig. The experimental results presented are compared with the corresponding numerical predictions and good agreement between them is demonstrated.

AB - Snow loads on sloped roofs are influenced by snow properties, meteorological factors, and building parameters. A statistical model of snow accumulation for unobstructed slippery roofs is developed. Sliding at the roofsnow interface is initiated by either a reduction in the resisting forces or shear failure; the latter involves a reduction in the shear resistance of the snowpack. Temperature, temperature‐time, and precipitation are used as independent variables to develop the conditional probabilities for sliding from field and laboratory data. Roof snow loads for a site in deep‐snow country are simulated using existing meteorological data to obtain probabilities of occurrence for temperature and precipitation. Simulated design loads are compared with values from ANSI A58.1‐1982 and the Idaho approach. Roof loads simulated from field and laboratory data demonstrate good agreement, but the two design approaches yield roof snow loads that are considerably higher than the simulated values.

AB - This paper summarizes the results of 400 fatigue tests of high‐strength bolted joints that were reported in eight domestic and six foreign studies. The following variables were investigated: type of bolt and washer, bolt pattern, bolts‐to‐member strength ratio, initial bolt tension, yield strength, skew, joint length, and partial connection of member elements. The analysis of the data showed that within the limits on maximum stress imposed by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) specifications on edge distance, bolt spacing, etc., both friction‐type and bearing‐type joints can be designed to Category B on the basis of the gross area stress range. The fatigue of long bolted joints with more than four bolt rows in a line of stress must be lowered from Category B to C. The stress range in members that transfer load through some, but not all, cross‐sectional elements must be calculated using a reduced effective gross area.

AB - Experience from past earthquakes has shown that beam‐to‐column connections play a critical role in the survival of reinforced concrete momentresisting frame buildings. It is thus important to develop design procedures that will ensure a satisfactory performance of connections during an earthquake. The current practice for the design of connections has evolved from laboratory testing of a large number of beam‐to‐column connections subassemblies. However, most of these tests did not include a slab, which, in a real building, is invariably an integral part of the framing system. Recently, some concern has been shown on the effect of the presence of a slab on the behavior of connections. The main objective of this investigation was to study the effect of the presence of a slab on the behavior of exterior beam‐to‐column connections. A total of six three‐quarter scale beam‐to‐column connection subassemblies were tested under a simulated earthquake‐type loading. The primary test variable was the width of the floor slab. The test results show the slab to have a significant effect on the strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation characteristics of connections and strongly suggest that ignoring the presence of a slab in the design of connections may not be appropriate.

The failure modes considered are yielding of the gross section and fracture of the net section. Statistics on the correlation coefficient between the yield strength and ultimate strength and the model error in calculating the effective net area are presented. A critical review is made of the code in light of the fact that the reliability index of the member is always less than the reliability index of either mode.
