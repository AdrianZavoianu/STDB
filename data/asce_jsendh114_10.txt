AB - The bearing capacity of a masonry element subjected to compression is generally determined by elastic calculations that take into account the different mechanical properties of the constituents. Compared to experimental checks, these estimates show a systematic error in the order of 50‐100%. This is due to the impossibility of defining unequivocally the values of the normal modulus of elasticity and of the transversal contraction coefficient (especially for mortar). These observations suggest that the problem should be approached from a totally different point of view, i.e., not confining the stress analysis to the elastic phase, but taking into account the inelastic phase preceding the rupture. In this work, an evaluation of the bearing capacity is carried out by superimposing a field of fundamental stresses that is balanced with the assigned compressive load, and plane fields that are balanced with null forces. This technique provides only the lower limit of the collapse load. The model reproduces closely the qualitative features of the rupture behavior of masonry described by experimental results available in the literature.

AB - A probabilistic methodology has been developed to assess the risk of wind‐induced damage to structures and facilities. This methodology has been applied to a number of facilities and power plants in the United States for tornadoes, hurricanes, and straight‐wind storms. The wind effects considered include dynamic pressure, atmospheric pressure change, and wind‐borne missile impact loads. The facility structures and components are described by a reliability network, which is analyzed to provide the system failure probability considering all failure modes. Probabilistic Monte Carlo methods, coupled with variance reduction techniques, are used in the computations. The methodology requires site‐specific information on facility layout, missile sources, and wind frequencies. Three‐dimensional steady‐state windfields are modeled, and time‐history calculations of missile trajectories are used to predict the loading distributions on each structure. The model outputs include component and system damage probabilities for different levels of design protection and, for existing facilities, optimal upgrade and risk‐reduction strategies.

AB - The yield line analysis method is used to develop an expression for predicting yield strengths of joints in welded Warren‐type hollow structural section trusses with round end‐cropped webs and rectangular chords. Yield strengths computed using the expression are compared with those measured in an experimental investigation of 39 Warren‐type cropped‐web HSS truss joint specimens. Good agreement between the measured and predicted values is demonstrated. The yield strength expression is augmented, by accounting for membrane forces, to obtain an expression for predicting ultimate joint strengths. The prediction formula is calibrated to the mean of the ultimate strengths of the 39 test specimens. When used in conjunction with the appropriate LRFD resistance factor, the ultimate strength prediction formula produces a safe value for use in design.

AB - In high‐rise concrete buildings, contractors can increase their construction rate by using high‐strength concrete with a two‐day cycle. The fast construction rate will reduce the cost of formwork, as well as the number of working days. However, the effect of the fast construction rate on short‐ and long‐term deflections is not clearly understood. Herein, a 3‐D three‐story R.C. flat plate‐column system model was analyzed for two construction rates: one floor/two days, the fast rate, and one floor/seven days, the usual rate in practice. The analysis has been made by the finite element method, including the effects of concrete creep and cracking. It is found that the fast rate of construction in high‐rise R.C. flat plate‐type buildings will not increase short‐ or long‐term deflections, provided that high‐strength concrete (fc′⩾7,000psi) and high early strength cement (Type III) are used. On the contrary, the fast construction rate when using normal‐strength concrete (fc′=5,000psi) increases deflections by as much as 50%. It is also found that both the creep and the rate of construction have an insignificant effect on bending moments.

AB - Finite panels are large finite elements which permit plate structures to be analyzed with minimum discretisation. Data preparation and computer storage requirements are significantly reduced with finite panels compared with conventional finite elements. A new finite panel for plate bending is presented which removes a number of restrictions of an earlier panel. Complete functions are used to represent displacements, with coefficients being chosen to make a modified potential energy functional assume a stationary value. Panel matrices, which are presented in an explicit form, may be used to analyze structures using standard finite element procedures. The panel has variable degrees of freedom, which enables convergence to be readily assessed. For single panels, and plate systems simply supported on two opposite sides, the proposed method leads to many well known exact and approximate solutions. Two examples demonstrate the accuracy of the panel.

AB - The evaluation of existing bridges has received little attention in the structural reliability literature, yet probabilistic methods allow the evaluation of the adequacy of a structure better than deterministic analysis. Bridge test data can be used to improve the accuracy of load and resistance models. In this paper, available safety analysis procedures are reviewed. Bridge evaluation can be also carried out on the basis of tests, and various bridge test types are discussed. A discrepancy is observed between the analytical and test results. Measured member forces are consistently lower than calculated values. This indicates the importance of load sharing and redundancies. The hidden safety reserve‐can be revealed by use of system reliability methods. The reliability model can be significantly improved by use of test data to modify the load and resistance parameters. The approach is demonstrated on an example of a steel truss bridge.

AB - A finite difference solution is presented for shear lag effect on the box girder with varying depth. The analysis is carried out according to Reissner's method in which the spanwise displacement is assumed to be a quartic parabolic curve on the cross section instead of a quadratic. Under four types of loading, shear lag effects are computed on a cantilever box girder with linearly varying depth. The results are compared with model tests. Finally, some conclusions are drawn about the distribution of shear lag effect along the cantilever box girder with varying depth.

Empirical expressions for the optimum orthotropy ratios for the slab panel alone, as well as for the slab‐spandrel system, based on extensive computer analysis, are presented.

AB - Those methods of bridge analysis that are developed basically for right bridges are also sometimes used for analyzing (skew bridges provided that the angle of skew is less than 20°. A critical review of this practice is presented in this paper, which also contains a recommended procedure for obtaining longitudinal moments with good accuracy in skew slab‐on‐girder bridges by this practice. It is shown that the errors in analyzing skew slab‐on‐girder bridges as right are not characterized by the angle of skew but by two dimensionless parameters, which depend upon the angle of skew, the spacing and span of girders, and their flexural rigidities relative to the flexural rigidity of the deck slab. Recommendations are given for the use of the simplified methods of analysis for skew slab‐on‐girder bridges. It is proposed that bridges having (S tan ϕ/L) less than 0.05 can be analyzed as equivalent right bridges, where S, L, and ϕ are the girder spacing, bridge span, and angle of skew, respectively.

AB - The paper describes the results of application of a simple orthotropic constitutive relationship for concrete to the prediction of the behavior of shear panels and deep beams. The axes of orthotropy are assumed to coincide with the principal strain axes even after cracking. Reasonable correspondence with test results is obtained for orthogonally reinforced shear panels, in which the failure modes vary from ductile failure for which steel in both directions yields, to concrete crushing after steel in one direction yields, to concrete crushing prior to steel yielding. The same constitutive relationship is used to predict the behavior of an orthogonally reinforced deep beam exhibiting concrete crushing at the support and a deep beam with no web reinforcement exhibiting concrete “strut” failure. Results of the analyses indicate that nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) may be used with reasonable confidence to predict the land‐deformation behavior, the failure load, and failure mode of reinforced concrete deep beams and panels.

AB - Three tests were conducted on identical one‐way reinforced concrete slabs. The tests were conducted using water over a waterproof membrane to apply a uniform surface pressure under three conditions: (1) With the test slab surface flush; (2) with the slab surface one foot (30.5 cm) deep in a clay soil backfill; and (3) with the slab surface one foot (30.5 cm) deep in a sand backfill. The reaction structure supporting the slabs was rigid enough to effectively prevent translation or support rotation at the clamped edges and to prevent in‐plane thrust in the slab generated by lateral earth pressures. The surface flush slab failed at about 174 psi (1.22 MPa), failure in the clay backfill occurred at about 171 psi (1.20 MPa), and failure in the sand backfill occurred at about 835 psi (5.83 MPa), overpressure. The almost fivefold increase in capacity in the sand backfill was due primarily to soil arching in the high shear strength sand backfill. These test results indicate that soil arching is much more important than current calculations indicate at this very shallow burial depth.

AB - The alignment chart used in the present AISC and CAN3‐M84 specifications defines the column effective length factor K in terms of the relative joint bending stiffness ratio Gs at each end of the column. In the development of the alignment chart, the far ends of columns above and below the column being considered are assumed to be rigidly jointed. In practice, some columns are not rigidly connected. A direct use of the alignment chart without any modifications results in an effective length factor that can be either too conservative or even unsafe depending on the boundary conditions of the restraining columns. This paper derives the general effective length factor equations for columns in braced frames, corresponding to five different boundary conditions of top and bottom columns. A simple modification of the present alignment chart for the determination of a more accurate K‐value for the design of columns in braced frames is proposed. The procedure is illustrated by several numerical examples.

AB - Snow load factors are critically examined for use in load and resistance factor design (LRFD). Specifically examined are the effects on structural reliability of the change in the basic ground load to roof load conversion factor from 0.8 to 0.7 and recent statistical data concerning the conversion factor. Using the recent data on the groundload to roof‐load conversion factor, statistics are obtained for the one‐year and fifty‐year snow load. Based on these statistics, the reliability index is on the order of 1.6 when snow load controls the design. Increasing the snow load factor from 1.6 to 2.0 increases the reliability index to roughly 2.0. Also examined is the use of extreme value theory to model the 50‐year snow load. It is determined that a direct application of extreme value theory leads to inaccurate estimates of structural reliability.

AB - American, British, and Canadian specifications for the effective diameter of bolt hole, effective net area, and ultimate strength of bolted steel single angles connected by one leg and subjected to axial tension are reviewed. The load-carrying capacities computed according to AASHTO, AISC-LRFD, ASCE, BS 5950:1985 and CAN3-S16.1-M84 are compared with the available test data. It is concluded that: (1) In the case of unequal leg angles, consideration should be given as to whether the long leg is connected or long leg is out; (2) for certain combinations of end distance, edge distance, and pitch, block shear mode of failure may govern instead of net section failure; and (3) the specifications give unduly conservative values for ultimate strengths of angles if end connections are made by close tolerance bolts (fitted bolts).
