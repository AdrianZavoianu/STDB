AB - Snow slides off unobstructed slippery sloped roofs, but this behavior is not adequately quantified. As a result, most building codes and standards require slippery sloped roofs to be designed for excessively large snow loads, and dynamic forces imposed by snow sliding from slippery sloped roofs are approximated. We propose design recommendations using the results from a field investigation, wherein the effects of slope and thermal environment are measured independently of other snow accumulation factors. Data from instrumented sloped roofs are combined with observations from a group of similar structures. A flat‐roof building with four different thermal conditions is monitored as a control for the sloped roofs. Results are widely applicable since the field site has significant snow accumulation during the years of study. Regression analysis is used to formulate new sloped roof coefficients; the coefficient errors are normally distributed.

AB - Fifteen tests to failure are performed on full‐scale composite beams with web openings. The beams have ribbed slabs with formed steel deck. The ribs are perpendicular or parallel to the steel section. The etfects of moment‐shear ratio, quantity and placement of shear connectors, deck orientation, and deck thickness are studied. The concrete slab contributes significantly to both the flexural and shear strength of beams at web openings. Peak loads are governed by failure of the slab. Rib failure around shear connectors occurs in slabs with transverse ribs, while longitudinal shear failure occurs in slabs with longitudinal ribs. Strength at an opening increases as the shear‐connector capacity above the opening and between the opening and the support increases. The implications for design are discussed.

AB - Design procedures are presented for composite beams with unreinforced web openings. The procedures apply to beams with either solid or ribbed slabs. Ribs may be either parallel or perpendicular to the steel member. Strength predictions are compared with test results and predictions of other analysis and design methods. Unique features include a general formulation for pure shear strength and a direct solution for strength under combined bending and shear. The procedures are easier to use than both detailed strength models and existing design techniques. Accuracy compares favorably with strength models and is superior to existing design techniques. A resistance factor of 0.85 is recommended for both shear and bending.

AB - Failure mechanisms in reinforced concrete plates subjected to in‐plane forces are presented. Failures due to the yielding of reinforcement and due to the crushing of concrete are examined. In the case of yielding of steel, equations are derived which predict the ultimate load and the direction of the ultimate crack for proportional loading. In the case of crushing of concrete, the tensor of concrete stresses between the cracks is derived, and the ultimate load is determined from the concrete strength under combined tension and compression. The ultimate load is predicted for both proportional and nonproportional loading. Derived equations have been applied to plate elements reinforced with steel bars in two orthogonal directions, and subjected to uniaxial or biaxial uniform loading. Experimental and theoretical results show a very good agreement.

AB - A series of experimental investigations of the elastic stress distribution in gusset plates have been conducted over the years. The design codes for the gusseted joints of the stiffening girder of the Honshu‐Shikoku suspension bridge were based on these investigations. Because of the flexibility of long‐span suspension bridges, due regard must be paid to the mechanical properties beyond the elastic range. This report deals with the mechanical properties of gusseted joints up to the ultimate state by using eight test specimens. The load‐carrying mechanism is examined in relation to the stability of gusseted joints; the development of plastic zones, local buckling strength, and ultimate strength are also discussed. Safety factors for ultimate strength and the proposed thickness of gusset plates based on buckling analysis are examined both experimentally and numerically by the finite element method.

AB - Tests were conducted on 1/6.6‐scale reinforced‐concrete bridge deck slabs under static load, pulsating load applied at a fixed point, and moving constant wheel‐load. Both isotropic and orthotropic reinforcing arrangements were considered. The current AASHTO design approach (orthotropic reinforcement) appears to be overconservative. The moving wheel‐load results in far more damage than the fixed pulsating load, and the cracking pattern due to the former loading is segmental (gridlike) and more extensive. The failure mode for all reinforced model decks is that of punching shear and not flexure. It is concluded that the reinforcement content in a bridge deck can be reduced significantly and satisfy both serviceability and strength requirements.

AB - The successful past performance of an existing structure is evidence of its reliability and safety. A proof load test, for example, provides direct information on strength: the resistance of a surviving structure is shown by the test to be greater than the proof load. Accordingly, the estimate of eliability increases after a successful test. Other kinds of information can be shown to have an effect on reliability similar to proof load testing, including correlation of test and design failure modes, successful resistance to past service loading, and survival age of a structure. In the analyses, statistical techniques are used to combine a first estimate of strength with new information on the past performance of the structure, thereby obtaining an improved estimate of structural resistance. The new estimate of strength is then used in the subsequent evaluation of the structure. Increasing reliability estimates and decreasing failure rates are observed for older structures, and the likelihood of gross errors in strength is found to reduce with survival age.

AB - A nonlinear theory for analyzing the buckling behavior of sheathed walls is presented. The theory predicts that the reversal of lateral deflection occurs when the load is applied near the compression center of the wall. This phenomenon is due to the movement of the compression center caused by the nonlinear joint stiffness. Tests are conducted to verify the theory. A good agreement between test results and theoretical results is seen. The resulting difference between the nonlinear theory and the linear theory presented in a previous paper by the author is investigated. The linear theory is found to approximately predict the wall buckling at low values of nail slip and loads until the wall reaches buckling loads. Because of the partial composite action, the sheathed walls have a higher maximum load than unsheathed walls as long as the load is applied at the same position.

AB - Wind pressure differences are measured across the rain screen and across the air barrier assembly of precast open rain screen wall panels. Twelve panels are instrumented mostly on the west, north, and east walls of the 24th floor of a 27‐story office building in downtown Montreal. 32 channels were scanned at 30 times per second to allow reasonable resolution of peak gusts. However, some doubt remains about their spatial extent, as each 3.6×2.9m(11.8×9.5ft) panel had only one external tap. The maximum load measured on the rain screen in one year of continuous monitoring was 285 Pa (6 psf), of duration 1 second. The largest pressure difference across an entire panel of the uilding envelope never coincided with peak pressure differences on the rain screen. However, maxima due to wind only, across windward panels, ranged from 400–475 Pa (8.4–9.9 psf). Pressure differences across the air barrier assembly of wall panels included stack and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) effects of up to 150 Pa (3.1 psf) when outside temperatures dropped to -20°C (-4°F).

AB - Finite element idealization of thin‐walled structural members under combined flexural and torsional deformation, using the degeneration concept, is presented. The warping displacement field is discretized by an assembly of finite elements which together forms a specific thin‐walled cross section. Based on the assumption that the distortion in the plane of the thin‐walled cross section is negligible, only three “sectional” degrees of freedom are employed in common for all elements of the same cross section. This greatly reduced the overall size of the degrees of freedom. Several thin‐walled structural problems with torsional restraints are solved to illustrate the versatility and the efficiency of the proposed elements.

AB - For large‐displacement and small‐strain analysis of planar general arches, the field transfer matrix is formulated for a curved element applicable to arbitrary arch geometry. The total displacements are clearly separated into the large rigid‐body displacements and the small elastic deformations. The formulation includes no approximation except the assumed small deflection theory for the elastic deformations. To establish a general computational strategy, however, the initial arch configuration is assumed to be accurately represented by using blending functions. No special shape functions for displacements are needed. The formulation is shown to be simple and accurate in theory and useful in practice.

AB - A new method for the analysis of cables that may roll on sheaves is presented. Implicit in this method is the use of a new pulley element which can model a finite length of cable supported somewhere along its length by a pulley. The pulley element simplifies computations by automatically adjusting the proportion of cable on each side of a sheave in order to maintain equilibrium. This is useful for converging to a static solution as well as tracking cable translations during a dynamic simulation. This paper describes the algorithms used by the pulley element and presents examples that utilize the element in static applications.

The deflected shape of the system is decomposed into those of flexural and shear‐flexure cantilevers. For the latter, an accurate approximate buckling load formula is also presented. Inserting the buckling loads of the two systems in Dunkerley's formula yields the required buckling load. The formula is compared with exact results computed by finite differences and good agreement is demonstrated.

AB - Experimental observations on the effect of freezing cycles on the bond behavior between steel reinforcement and concrete are reported. Specimens that experienced 1, 10, and 30 freezing cycles are tested under monotonic and reversed cyclic loadings. Results are compared with experimental observations of identical specimens that did not experience freezing cycles. Under monotonic loading the maximum bond resistance decreases as the number of freezing cycles increases. For reversed cyclic loading the average value of bond factors (ratio of maximum bond strengths to compressive strength) in both directions decreases with an increasing number of freezing cycles. In addition, other mechanical properties of concrete experiencing freezing cycles are also determined. It is concluded that cyclic temperature changes do have definite effects on the bond strength of reinforced concrete structures and on the mechanical properties of concrete.

AB - Concrete is a multiphase material in which aggregate particles are distributed in the mortar matrix. Since a large volume of the concrete is occupied by aggregate, it is likely that variation in aggregate content will significantly influence the strength and deformation behavior. Prepacked concrete, as it contains a higher proportion of coarse aggregate, shows characteristics in failure that are widely dissimilar from those of normal concrete. This paper presents some aspects of failure mechanism of prepacked concrete observed during testing in compression. Along with the observations, some theoretical considerations are also made and discussed.
