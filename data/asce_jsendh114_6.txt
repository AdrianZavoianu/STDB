AB - A conceptual design of a hexagonal platform for a water depth of 310 m in the North Sea is described. The structure is designed for an extreme wave‐loading condition accounting for dynamic amplification corresponding to a first natural period of 6.0 s. A detailed fatigue analysis of the platform is presented. It has been demonstrated that by a proper design taking into account wave cancellation effects at the design stage it is possible to achieve good fatigue lives beyond the requirements of the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate regulations for this deepwater platform. A study on the effect of the fundamental period on fatigue life has been performed. In addition a full probabilistic analysis of the fundamental period has been carried out. Finally, the expected fatigue life of the platform has been derived, taking into account the uncertainties associated with the fundamental period.

AB - Flowcharts are presented for the analysis and design of biaxially and uniaxially loaded, reinforced‐concrete, tied columns in accordance with the “moment magnification method” of ACI 318‐83, section 10.11. Nonslender and slender columns in braced and unbraced frames are considered. The case of “appreciable” sway due to gravity loads in unbraced frames is also considered. The flowcharts can be used as step by step guides for manual computations or for coding subroutines in a computer program. The charts can easily be modified for any cross section shape and for other national or international codes. Where the wording of the American Concrete Institute code and commentary appears unclear, its intent is explored, discussed, and followed.

AB - Wind‐blown debris from roofs result in major building damage and failure during severe wind storms. Typically, roofs are only 2% of a building's cost, but their failure represents about 25% of hazardrelated lawsuits. The response of different types of roofing systems to wind loads induced by high wind speeds can be investigated in wind tunnels. Fluid model experiments that have identified the primary failure mechanisms of roofs covered by various combinations of single‐ply membranes, tiles, pavers, insulation boards, and gravels are reviewed. New data are presented on the uplift performance of pavers with overlap joints, the advantages of paver clips, and the influence of exposure and parapet height on paver movement.

AB - Thermal stresses are frequently used to camber steel beams or remove unwanted plastic deformation. A local concentration of heat is applied. The heated steel expands, but the expansion is restricted by the surrounding unheated metal. Compressive stress develops and yielding occurs. The method is complex and is practiced as an intuitive art which is not well understood by structural engineers. This paper describes a study of the theoretical models for predicting the effects of the process. The models are temperature‐dependent, inelastic models. The computation of heat flow is described, and methods of analysis and their convergence are noted. The advantages and disadvantages of the different models are noted, and the computed results are correlated to recent experiments. The results are generally in good agreement with trends noted in experiments. They show that increased temperature, heat angle and depth of heat increases the plastic deformation. Bending moments that cause compressive stress in the heated area also increase the plastic rotation, while an increase in the yield stress reduces the deformation. The analysis shows that large plastic strains must be expected with the V‐heat pattern. The results of this study provide a step in understanding this complex process.

AB - The equivalent wind spectrum technique is a mathematical model according to which wind is schematized as a stochastic stationary Gaussian process made up of a mean‐speed profile on which an equivalent turbulent fluctuation, perfectly coherent in space, is super‐imposed. The equivalent criterion is formulated by defining a fictitious velocity fluctuation, random function of time only, giving rise to power spectra of fluctuating modal force that approximate, optimally, the corresponding modal spectra related to the actual turbulence configuration. This paper presents the basic assumptions and the theoretical steps leading to the characterization of the equivalent velocity fluctuation through a power spectrum assigned in closed form. The method proposed herein allows one to estimate the dynamic along‐wind response of structures, both in frequency and in time domain, with a high level of precision and simplicity; furthermore it makes it possible to treat wind effects, as well as those of earthquakes, through the well‐known response spectrum technique.

AB - Based on the curvilinear coordinate system, the spline finite strip method is extended to the elasto‐static analysis of circular and noncircular box‐girder bridges. As the curvature effect cannot be ignored, the webs of the bridges have to be treated as thin shells and the flanges as flat curved plates. The shape functions for the description of the displacement field (radial, tangential, and vertical displacements) are given as products of B‐3 spline functions in the longitudinal direction and piecewise polynomials in the other direction. The stress‐strain and stiffness matrices can then be formed as in the standard finite element method. Three examples of box‐girder bridges of different geometrical shapes are employed to demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of the method. Compared to the finite element method, this method yields considerable savings in both computer time and effort, since only a small number of unknowns are generally required in the analysis.

AB - Approximate methods for the estimation of maximum story drift in elastoplastic multidegree‐of‐freedom (MDOF) shear buildings are examined. The structures considered have fundamental periods in the range of 0.4–4.0 seconds and have one, two, three, five, and ten degrees of freedom. Responses for maximum ductility levels of one (elastic), two, five, and ten are considered. Two methods for predicting the maximum story drift are developed and evaluated. In the first method, the response of the multidegree‐of‐freedom inelastic system is estimated by applying two deamplification factors to the elastic spectrum of the single degree‐of‐freedom system. The second technique identifies an equivalent linear multidegree‐of‐freedom system. The effects of the number of degrees of freedom and the maximum ductility level on the deamplification factors and the equivalent linear parameters are described.

AB - Piles in integral abutment bridges (jointless bridges) are subjected to lateral movement due to thermal expansion and contraction of the superstructure. The reduction in vertical load‐carrying capacity of the piles due to lateral movement is an important parameter in designing the piles and in setting length limits for the jointless bridge. A simplified design method for analyzing piles in integral abutment bridges is presented. The model was developed from previous analytical models and observations of pile behavior. Two failure modes for a pile are examined: the slip mechanism, where the pile slips through the soil; and the lateral mechanism where the failure of the soil‐pile system is associated with lateral movement of the pile. Equations for determining the ultimate load for the pile for each mechanism are obtained. Results predicted by the simplified model are compared to results from a nonlinear finite element program and shown to be conservative with respect to the finite element model.

AB - Many of the existing soil‐metal structures have shown signs of serious distress, including local failures. A major cause of these distress conditions is believed to be due to poor compaction of the soil backfill. To correct this shortcoming, research work was undertaken to examine the following design concept: (1) The metal structure is tied back into the surrounding granular soil; and (2) the soil cover above the metal structure is reinforced. Experimental results, obtained from tests on five models, were compared to analytical results based on the finite‐element method. The results show that adopting this new design concept: (1) Provides greater stability to the metal structure; (2) improves the stiffness of the soil; (3) activates the entire reinforced‐soil medium to assist in the transmission of the load; (4) enhances the arching effect; and (5) makes it possible to observe very large deformations in the metal structure before its collapse and thus avoid catastrophic failure. A simplified design method and an illustrated design example are presented.

AB - The purpose of this study is to investigate the ultimate strength of thin‐walled welded‐steel box columns subjected to a combination of axial load, bending moment, and shear force at the ends. The moment‐curvature‐thrust relationships, incorporating the local buckling of component plates and residual stresses, are obtained first. These relationships are used to determine the envelope of equilibrium curves from which the column curves are constructed. The presence of initial column imperfection is provided in the form of constant curvature along the length. The results are presented in the form of column curves for different values of plate slenderness, column imperfection, end moment, and moment ratio. Theoretical predictions obtained using the proposed curves are compared to a limited number of test results available in the literature.

This is the most critical step in any approximate analysis. The method presented in this paper is very useful in producing preliminary designs, checking computer results, and getting a feel for the structural behavior. The one simple formula presented herein produces far greater accuracy than existing methods. Existing methods rely on various rule‐of‐thumb techniques which are, at best, satisfactory for limited ranges of geometries. Several examples which demonstrate the use of the derived equation are presented.

AB - A stiffness matrix and nodal load vector of a beam element on a two‐parameter elastic foundation is developed for concentrated loads, concentrated moments, and linearly distributed forces. The formulation is based on the exact solution of the differential equation governing displacements. Numerical analysis shows that the accuracy of the results using this beam element is independent of element refinement. The beam‐element also can be easily coupled with two‐dimensional frame analysis to investigate superstructure‐foundation‐soil interaction. The numerical results for a two‐dimensional frame supported on a beam on elastic foundation indicate that the second parameter not only introduces continuity to the deflection pattern of the foundation, but also affects the distribution of stresses in the elements at the column‐foundation junctions.

The kinematic approach is used in the formulation of LP problem. The method is simple and straightforward to use and does not require the investigation of various yield-line patterns as long as the actual yield-line patterns can be described by the descretization lines. This is another example of the solution of problems of engineering plasticity by mathematical programming.
