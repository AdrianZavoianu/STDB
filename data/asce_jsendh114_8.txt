AB - Earlier impact studies on a small‐span bridge under service loads gave impact fractions much higher than, those specified by AASHTO. This paper represents the first stage of a program to identify the high‐impact vehicles. It describes theoretical studies that use bridge measurements to estimate not only the equivalent static loads but also their dynamic variation with time. Acceptable estimates have been obtained. The use of measured bending moments gives better results than measured deflections. The correct selection of nodal spacing and arrangement is important.

AB - Laboratory tests are described that explore the validity of using bridge measurements to determine not only equivalent static wheel loads but also their dynamic variation with time. A 12.2‐m span composite girder was loaded with one to four dynamic loads fixed in location. Acceptable load predictions were obtained from measured strains and computed bending moments at the one‐eighth points of the span. Estimates of dynamic load at a reduced accuracy were also obtained from measured deflections. Accurate dynamic calibration tests were necessary to find the equivalent beam‐bending stiffness used in the dynamic interpretive analysis and also the strain‐bending moment relationships.

AB - This study investigates the behavior of composite concretesteel girders and evaluates their role in wind bents of unbraced Type 2 steel building frames. A nonlinear inelastic computer program is developed to perform a limit state analysis of partial composite girders and provide the nonlinear bending characteristics needed for collapse analysis of frames. The results indicate that composite girders do not increase frame strength compared to equivalent designs using noncomposite girders. It is concluded that the current design method used for Type 2 design with composite girders in a wind bent will result in frames with an adequate, though not excessive, level of safety for typical frames less than 10 stories in height.

AB - A finite element model for brick masonry subjected to in‐plane loading is presented. The proposed model reproduces the nonlinear characteristics of masonry caused by material nonlinearity and progressive local failure. Bricks and joints are modeled separately, allowing for nonlinear deformation characteristics of the two materials as well as failure of the bricks, the mortar, or the mortar joints by bond. Because of its ability to model local effects, the model is capable of reproducing the behavior of masonry walls in which high local stresses and stress gradients are present (e.g., walls subjected to concentrated loads from beam supports or prestressing anchorages). The material properties for the model are determined from tests on small samples of brickwork and its constituents. Concentrated load tests on brick masonry are used as a basis for comparison between predicted theory and experimental evidence.

AB - The current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) methods of lateral load distribution in bridges, because of being too simplistic in basic assumptions, have been found to be unrealistic for at least some bridges. A set of new methods of load distribution is presented in this paper for slab‐on‐girder bridges. These methods, which are suitable for adoption in the AASHTO specifications, were developed by using the same principles as those on which the current AASHTO methods are based. While the proposed methods do take into account all those aspects of a bridge that influence its load distribution characteristics, their use is similar in format and simplicity to those of the current AASHTO methods. The paper also critically examines the basic assumptions on which the AASHTO methods are based.

AB - A stress‐strain model is developed for concrete subjected to uniaxial compressive loading and confined by transverse reinforcement. The concrete section may contain any general type of confining steel: either spiral or circular hoops; or rectangular hoops with or without supplementary cross ties. These cross ties can have either equal or unequal confining stresses along each of the transverse axes. A single equation is used for the stress‐strain equation. The model allows for cyclic loading and includes the effect of strain rate. The influence of various types of confinement is taken into account by defining an effective lateral confining stress, which is dependent on the configuration of the transverse and longitudinal reinforcement. An energy balance approach is used to predict the longitudinal compressive strain in the concrete corresponding to first fracture of the transverse reinforcement by equating the strain energy capacity of the transverse reinforcement to the strain energy stored in the concrete as a result of the confinement.

AB - Thirty‐one nearly full‐size reinforced concrete columns, of circular, square, or rectangular wall cross section, and containing various arrangements of reinforcement, were loaded concentrically with axial compressive strain rates of up to 0.0167/s. The circular sections contained longitudinal and spiral reinforcement, the square sections contained longitudinal reinforcement and square and octagonal transverse hoops, and the rectangular wall sections contained longitudinal reinforcement and rectangular hoops with or without supplementary cross ties. The longitudinal stress‐strain behavior of the confined concrete was measured and compared with that predicted by a previously derived stress‐strain model with allows for the effects of various configurations of transverse confining reinforcement, cyclic loading, and strain rate. The measured longitudinal concrete compressive strain when the transverse steel first fractured was also compared with that predicted by equating the strain energy capacity of the transverse reinforcement to the strain energy stored in the concrete as a result of the confinement.

AB - This paper recounts an examination of longitudinal stress‐laminated timber deck bridges as a solution to the tremendous need for replacement bridges, particularly on rural roads. A long‐span full‐scale deck was built in the laboratory and subjected to a series of tests and theoretical analyses to obtain behavioral information. The stress‐laminating procedure was found to be an effective means of developing a wide “distribution width” for resisting loads on a longitudinal deck bridge. The laboratory study was followed by construction of a prototype bridge in the United States and development of a method for assembling a bridge deck from prefabricated stressed panels. In addition to having a wide distribution width, the stress‐laminated deck was found to provide a medium range bridge span with a thin section allowing sufficient hydraulic clearance, to be able to built with a simple anchorage system for prestressing rods, to provide an economic bridge system compared with steel and concrete, and to be quickly and easily erected. The primary limitation in use of the system is in the span range which can be attempted without exceeding deflection limits.

AB - An algorithm based on a nonlinear finite element procedure previously developed by the writers is modified and used to study the effect of thermally induced lateral movement on the vertical loadcarrying capacity of piles in integral abutment bridges. The pile and soil are idealized using beam‐column elements with geometric and material nonlinearities and nonlinear springs, respectively. Two computer programs have been developed to solve the nonlinear soil‐pile interaction problems for both two‐ and three‐dimensional cases. Analytical examples are presented to illustrate the effect of lateral displacements on the ultimate load capacity of the pile. The examples include end‐bearing steel H‐piles bending about the weak, strong, and 45° axes. The effects of cyclic lateral displacements are also investigated. The results show that the vertical load capacity of piles is significantly affected by lateral displacement. It is concluded that the length limitations for integral abutment bridges currently being used by most state highway departments are conservative.

AB - Reductions in steel weight of deepwater fixed jackets by 10,000 tons represent savings of many millions of dollars in material costs alone and substantial cost advantages during the transportation, fabrication, and installation phases. This paper shows that such savings are feasible by considering the impact of fluid‐structure action on design force levels. Deepwater jackets in 1,350–1,600 ft were analyzed, and certain configurations indicated that regular extreme wave dynamic base shears can be as much as 40% larger if fluid‐structure response were ignored. Design base shears derived from spectral‐type methods that accounted for more than a single extreme wave also differed substantially when relative velocity effects were included. The impact of differences in dynamic base shears and overturning moment on jacket steel were quantified. Because of the potential effect on force calculations, practical criteria are desirable that establish when the relative velocity form of Morison's equation is desirable.

AB - Sixteen welded steel specimens have been tested under variable amplitude loadings to determine the extent to which fatigue life is affected by the rate of amplitude variability of the loading process. It appears that rate of variation can significantly change the rate of fatigue damage. Comparisons have been made between the experimental results and commonly used analytical techniques such as the Rayleigh approximation and rainflow analysis. The experimental results are generally significantly lower than the predictions by either the Rayleigh approximation or the rainflow analysis. A new damage model is also hypothesized that gives predictions in very good agreement with the experimental results.

AB - A parametric study on three‐span cable‐stayed bridges with a radiating system of cables is presented. It is intended to investigate the effect of the stiffnessses of cables, pylons, and girders, as well as the effect of the central unsupported length of the main span, on the behavior of the various elements of the bridge superstructure. The study provides a better understanding of the bridge performance involving the cable forces, the girder and pylon displacements, as well as the pylon moments and axial forces due to live load. This contributes to the design of a real bridge, a laboratory model, or even a numerical example. It is shown that there is an optimum value for the central unsupported length of the main span, depending on the number of stay cables in the main span. The study shows also that the reduction in the bending stiffness of the girder results in excessive girder and pylon deflections, as well as large internal forces in the pylons and cables.
