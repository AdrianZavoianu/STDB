AB - The effective width of slab to be used for the case of lateral loading has not been explicitly addressed in design codes. Ignoring the slab contribution to the flexural capacity of the beams leads to a significant underestimation in structural strength. It may also lead to a failure mechanism different than that anticipated. Tests were conducted on three one‐half scale reinforced concrete beamcolumn‐slab subassemblages to determine the influence of the torsional stiffness of the transverse beam elements on the effective width of slab participating as a tension flange to the longitudinal beam. The effect of initial damage due to loading in the transverse direction was also investigated for one of the models. All of the models were subjected to the same cyclic lateral load history. It was concluded that the effective width of slab was greater for the models with increased transverse torsional stiffness. The difference in strength among the models was larger at the earlier loading cycles. At the maximum load condition, the difference was less than 10%.

AB - For many hyperbolic paraboloid shells, the horizonal reaction is provided by horizontal ties between the supports. It is shown that the horizontal movement of the supports associated with the elongation of these ties will alter sufficiently the stresses in the shell membrane and the axial forces and moments in the supporting edge members that these movements must be considered in the analysis. The effect of the outward support movement for gable‐type HP shells supported on four corners is to reduce the arching effect across the diagonal supports, resulting in behavior that resembles more closely that predicted by membrane theory. When such shells are placed to form continuous structures, the effect of the outward support movement causes the portion of shell in the vicinity of the first rows of interior supports to behave as inverted umbrella HP shells.

AB - In concrete structures, durability and compliance with functional requirements are strictly related to behavior in service conditions. In this paper, the analysis of the behavior of reinforced, partially prestressed, and prestressed concrete members is developed in a unified way by identifying the characteristic phases in the life of a structure: instantaneous load‐effect variations and effects of sustained loads. The analysis is performed for cracked or uncracked elements depending on whether or not the stresses due to load effects exceed the section's tensile strength. The effects of creep and shrinkage, of the variations in concrete modulus, and of the relaxation of the reinforcement are taken into account. The calculation of displacements and the evolution of redundant effects is carried out on the basis of the mean strain values which are determined by taking into account the influence of tension stiffening. For practical calculation purposes, the procedure advanced in this paper is based on the constitutive laws of the materials laid down in the 1978 Comite Euro‐International du Beton (CEB) Model Code for Concrete Structures.

AB - The paper presents the hysteresis behavior of axially loaded reinforced concrete bracing members. The object was to study the reduction in stiffness in relation to the number of cycles and the energy dissipation capacity. An existing ´compression‐only loading system´ was modified to provide tension‐compression cyclic loading. Eight specimens were tested, each having an effective length to the least lateral dimension ratio of 20 or 30. The effects of longitudinal steel, slenderness ratio, and confinement of concrete are analyzed in this paper. It is concluded that reinforced concrete bracing specimens possess considerably more strength and stiffness in compression than in tension. The initial stiffness in tension varied between 28–36% of the secant stiffness, based on the transformed concrete area. The stiffness in tension cycles varied between 13–140% and in compression cycles between 30–400% of the initial tension stiffness. A simple triangular hysteresis model is proposed that accounts for different elastic stiffnesses in tension and compression, stiffness degradation, and pinching‐in effects.

AB - An efficient computational procedure is presented for reducing the cost of the stress, free vibration, and buckling analyses of multilayered composite cylinders. The analytical formulation is based on the linear three‐dimensional theory of elasticity. The cylinders are assumed to have simply supported curved edges, and the fibers of the different layers are either in the circumferential or longitudinal direction. The fundamental unknowns consist of the six stress components and the three displacement components of the cylinder. Each of the variables is expressed in terms of a double Fourier series in the longitudinal and circumferential coordinates, and a two‐field mixed finite element model is used for the discretization in the thickness direction. The cylinder response associated with a range of Fourier harmonics in the longitudinal and circumferential directions is approximated by a linear combination of a few global approximation vectors, which are generated at particular values of the Fourier harmonics, within that range. The full equations of the finite element model are solved for only a single pair of Fourier harmonics, and the response corresponding to the other Fourier harmonics is generated using a reduced system of equations with considerably fewer degrees of freedom.

AB - An experimental research program based on a proposed approach to fatigue testing that does not require a traditional stress versus cycles relationship was conducted to evaluate the behavior of composite metal deck slabs subjected to transverse cyclic loads. The magnitude of the maximum dynamic test load, obtained from progressively increasing cyclic load tests, was established as a percentage of the allowable static design load, evaluated from a linear regression study of companion statically loaded specimens. Periodically during the cyclic loading, static load tests revealed an increase in permanent deflections as the numbers of load cycles increased. At the completion of the fatigue testing, a static strength test showed that a shear‐bond failure occurred for the cyclically loaded specimens. This mode of failure was the same as for the companion statically loaded specimens. In general, the magnitiude of the applied load causing failure was reduced by the cyclic loading. A predicted, shear‐bond, fatigue strength expression applicable to the particular composite metal deck involved is presented.

AB - An analytical‐numerical method is presented that can be used to determine the dynamic behavior of beams, with different boundary conditions, carrying a moving mass. This article demonstrates the transformation of a familiar governing equation into a new, solvable series of ordinary differential equations. The correctness of the results has been ascertained by a comparison, using finite element models, and very good agreement has been obtained. Furthermore, the article shows that the response of structures due to moving mass, which has often been neglected in the past, must be properly taken into account because it often differs significantly from the moving force model.

AB - A hysteretic model is proposed for shear response of reinforced concrete members subjected to shear force and bending moment reversals. The model consists of a primary shear force‐shear displacement curve and unloading and reloading branches under cyclic loading. The primary curve is the envelope curve for the hysteretic relationship, and can be considered the same as the force displacement relationship under monotonic loading up to the onset of strength decay. A primary curve established by any acceptable procedure, with well‐defined cracking and yield points, can be used in constructing the model. The rules proposed for unloading and reloading branches of the model were obtained from a large number of test data. Full‐scale column tests, under inelastic load reversals, were used for this purpose. These rules were developed to predict experimentally observed stiffness degradation and pinching of hysteresis loops. Empirically derived expressions were included to introduce the effects of axial load, deformation level, and the number of deformation cycles. The model was employed to reproduce the results of large scale tests of reinforced concrete elements. The comparisons include columns, beams, and structural walls, tested by different investigators. Individual hysteresis loops of small and large deformation cycles are compared with those produced by the model. The results show a good agreement between the model and the experimental data.

AB - The present AISC (American Institute of Steel Construction), ACI (American Concrete Institute), and CAN‐S16.1‐M84 Specifications use alignment charts conveniently to determine effective length factor for columns in both braced and unbraced frames. In this method, the effective length factor K is determined directly by the relative joint bending stiffness ratio G's at each end of the column under consideration. For the development of alignment charts, the far ends of columns above and below the column being designed are assumed to be rigidly connected. In engineering practice, however, some columns may not be rigidly jointed. For an unbraced frame, the present chart always provides an unconservative result when the far end conditions of columns above or below the column being considered are different from the usual alignment chart case. The general equation for the effective length factor K for columns in unbraced frames is derived in the first part of this paper. Extensive numerical studies arecmade using the equation developed. Against the background of this information, a modified alignment chart procedure for the determination of a more accurate ^‐factor for the design of columns in unbraced frames is then proposed. The proposed approach is illustrated by several numerical examples. Similar development for columns in braced frames has been reported previously by the authors.

AB - A new one‐dimensional model for random cyclic tension in concrete is developed. The model determines several geometrical loci, defined as focal points, in the uniaxial stress‐displacement plane, which are used to compute the complete unloading‐reloading curves. Given the complete load‐displacement curve, the focal points are located, and the path of any unloading‐reloading cycle can be computed. A cycle may also be plotted graphically without further calculations. The model is compared with test results recently obtained at the Stevin Laboratory, Delft University of Technology, as well as with other available data, and good agreement is shown.

AB - A six‐story eccentrically braced dual steel system (EBDS) was subjected to 24 earthquake ground motions with effective peak accelerations of up to 0.55 g on the earthquake simulator at the University of California at Berkeley. The design, construction, dynamic characteristics and experimental behavior of this eccentrically braced system are discussed in this paper. The EBDS was analyzed for its compliance with current earthquake‐resistant regulations that include the 1985 Uniform Building Code (UBC), 1984 Applied Technology Council (ATC) 3–06, and 1986 Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC). A substantial overstrength of this dual system with respect to its nominal yielding strength was observed and this is discussed in terms of the response modification factors currently adopted by the ATC and SEAOC. The lateral force distributions for the elastic level tests corresponded to the code‐base design lateral force distributions but varied considerably for the collapse level tests. The role of the ductile momentresisting space frame (DMRSF) in the EBDS is discussed in light of its performance during the testing program. Conclusions are drawn regarding the suitability of the EBDS for regions of high seismic risk and the response modification factors and lateral force distributions currently used or implied in the UBC, ATC, and SEAOC.

AB - Current capabilities of accurately predicting the behavior of the various subassemblies of light‐frame wood structures (walls, floors, and roofs) now meet (or exceed) the ability to characterize material properties. However, subassembly analysis techniques are not commonly incorporated in design practice. The deficiency lies in the inability to efficiently predict the interaction of the subassemblies which yields the behavior of the entire structure. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a simple structural analysis model to predict the behavior of light‐frame buildings under lateral load. The model is limited to the racking response of shear walls that are arranged in a rectangular fashion beneath a rigid ceiling/floor diaphragm. Nonlinear load‐slip behavior of fasteners is utilized in an energy formulation to yield a three‐degree‐of‐freedom representation of each story of the building. Predicted behavior from the analysis model agrees favorably with results from full‐scale tests. The model provides a method for estimating the behavior of light‐frame buildings near lateral loading and should lead to realistic shear wall strength and stiffness requirements for both residential and commercial buildings.

It is shown that large displacement effects and interaction between moment and axial force in the cross sections reduce the shakedown load substantially. This process is visualized in a diagram depicting load factor versus mean load factor. The curves drawn in this plane may be simplified by straight lines, reducing the effort of calculating the shakedown loads.

This modification is presented after a brief discussion of the static condensation method and a review of the original dynamic condensation method.
