AB - TWO alternative methods for the time‐dependent analysis of composite steel‐concrete cross sections are presented and compared. Both methods are fully developed and involve solution procedures that ensure compatibility of strains at every point on the cross section. One approach uses the age‐adjusted effective modulus method to include the effects of creep. The other involves Dischinger's differential constitutive relationship for concrete and a rate of creep solution procedure. The procedures can be performed manually, but are best suited to a small programmable calculator or microcomputer. Both methods are illustrated by example and the effects of both creep and shrinkage of concrete on the behavior of the cross section are determined and discussed.

AB - A numerical method to investigate the ultimate strength behavior of thin‐walled steel box columns subjected to axial load and biaxial end moments is presented in this paper. The columns are of uniform cross section along the length and simply supported at the ends. The local buckling of the component plates is taken into account by applying the effective width formulas proposed in an earlier paper. Moment‐curvature‐thrust relationships for a locally buckled box section are developed by using the tangent stiffness method, and the column analysis is then carried out by integrating, numerically, the moment‐curvature‐thrust relationships along the length. Due allowance is made in the analysis to account for imperfections such as initial column deflections and welding residual stresses. The accuracy of the method is established by comparison with limited experimental results for uniaxially loaded columns. Results for biaxially loaded columns are presented in the form of interaction diagrams. Several parameters such as plate slenderness, column slenderness, level of residual stress, axial load, and load path have been considered.

AB - Strength equations based on the skew‐bending model have been developed to predict the torsional strength of prestressed concrete beams containing a circular transverse opening and subjected to combined torsion and bending. Test results of 13 axially and eccentrically prestressed concrete beams with web reinforcements are presented. Close agreement is observed between the experimental and the predicted values. The interaction diagrams show that for small T/M ratio, mode 1 failure occurs and presence of bending moment reduces torsional strength. For high T/M ratio, however, bending moment has no effect on the torsional moment capacity. Compared with the precracking range, the torsional stiffness is very much reduced in the postcracking range. Test results show that eccentric prestressing is more economical than axial prestressing.

AB - AS current design codes are either too complicated or too inaccurate, a new approach is formulated by the posterior analysis of 254 worldwide tests. It is sufficiently accurate for design purposes, while also very simple. It permits the realistic proportioning not only of plate girder webs and flanges but also of the transverse and longitudinal stiffeners. The probabilistic aspect of modern safety philosophies is accounted for by introducing resistance factors that fit the 5% fractiles of test results as lower bounds of the ultimate strength.

AB - Structural dynamic responses of elevator counterweight systems with discontinuous connectivity (a large gap) between the counterweights and their frame are evaluated using the finite element techniques. External base excitation results in dynamic contacts between the weights and frames. A contact element with nonlinear stiffness and damping is developed to simulate the dynamic contact. To prevent the dynamic contacts and to improve the structural dynamic responses, rubber dampers modeled by a rubber finite element are introduced between the frame and the weights. The analyses show that introducing a large separation between the counterweights and the frame eliminates the dynamic contact at small amplitude oscillation; however, the contact load increases if the base motion exceeds the separation. The implementation of rubber damping can reduce the load by 84% as compared with that of current design practice. A design equation and a proposed installation of the rubber damper are also proposed and illustrated.

AB - Although heat‐straightening has been used for the repair of damaged steel structures for over 40 yr, the process is more of an art than a science. Since the effects of heat‐straightening steel structures are not well understood by the engineering community, a number of undocumented opinions have appeared in the literature that are false or misleading. Presented here is a state‐of‐the‐art review in the form of popular fables followed by the documented facts related to each one. Sixteen fables are listed in two categories: basic material properties and behavior of structural systems. The references cited form a comprehensive bibliography on the subject of heat‐straightening effects on steel. The selection of facts and fables has been chosen to provide the reader with an understanding of the process, important factors influencing heat‐straightening of rolled and built‐up members, a working knowledge of its effect on the material properties of steel, and the sources for additional information. Heat‐straightening has produced a good track record that illustrates the potential of the method for providing safe and economical repairs.

AB - A model to predict the stress‐strain behavior of concrete composites under random cyclic compressive loadings is developed. The model uses the envelope unloading strain as an index of load history. The plastic strain and reloading strain are predicted as functions of the envelope unloading strain for both full and partial unloading and reloading. Expressions for the unloading and reloading curves are also given. The model is independent of the expression used for the envelope curve. Comparison with cyclic data shows good agreement. The model suggests a new way to conceptualize the behavior of concrete under cyclic loading, as the loading history index is related to an actual physical quantity. The model's strength is in its simplicity and generality. The model can be used for completely random loadings, in both the pre‐peak and post‐peak ranges. Potential uses include not only nonlinear analysis of earthquake‐resistant structures, but also prediction of energy dissipation and fatigue life.

AB - The finite element method is used to study the confinement of concrete by rectangular ties in reinforced‐concrete tied columns. Eight columns are analyzed under monotonically increasing axial cumpression until failure. A general approach for nonlinear analysis of reinforced‐concrete columns based on the finite element is developed. The effects of the volumetric ratio of lateral reinforcement and the distribution of the longitudinal steel and the resulting tie configuration on the confinement action are studied. The results indicate that both the strength and ductility of tied columns increase as the volumetric ratio of the lateral ties increases. The study demonstrates that the relationship between gain in strength of the confined concrete and the volumetric ratio of the lateral steel is approximately linear. It is found that lateral confinement had no effect on the behavior of tied columns at loads less than 70% of the ultimate load. The finite element approach favorably predicted the results obtained experimentally by other investigators.

AB - The behavior of beam‐to‐column connections has been studied in the past by testing individual connection subassemblies. In such tests, the beams are allowed to elongate freely when subjected to large deformation reversals. In a real building, however, the beams may be partially restrained against such elongation. In this investigation, the behavior of connections is studied under earthquake‐type loading by testing indeterminate frame subassemblies. Any restriction to the elongation of the main beams and the accompanying axial compression are observed to affect the response of connections. It increases joint shear in both interior and exterior connections and reduces the column‐to‐beam flexural strength ratio. The energy dissipation is not affected, but the lateral load resistance increases significantly. The loss of stiffness in the indeterminate subassembly is more controlled and gradual compared to that observed in individual connection tests. Based on the observed mechanism of lateral load resistance and the observed behavior of connections, a procedure is presented to account for the presence of axial compression in the main beams in the design of beam‐to‐column connections.

AB - Asymmetry of the shape, supports, or loading of frames causes the initial post critical behavior to exhibit asymmetric bifurcation. Its source is the second‐order axial shortening of columns due to lateral deflection, which induces asymmetric shear forces and bending moments transmitted into the column from the adjacent beams. As an alternative to Koiter, Roorda, and Chilver's solutions based on the nonlinear differential equations for deflections and perturbation method, the paper presents a simpler and more general method of analysis that uses the stiffness matrices and stability functions from linear stability theory of frames. The usual linear matrix equilibrium equations are enhanced by additional terms that are quadratic in joint rotations, with coefficients that depend on the derivatives of the stability functions. The solution is accurate up to the second order in deflections. As an example, Koiter and Roorda's L‐frame is analyzed and the results are shown to agree with the previous solutions as well as Roorda's experiments. It is concluded that the decrease of the maximum load due to asymmetric bifurcation is not insignificant and should be taken into account in design.

AB - Increasingly, engineers are designing composite and mixed building systems of structural steel and reinforced concrete to produce more efficient structures than realized using either material alone. Recent literature has pointed out a need for greater understanding of the interaction of structural steel and reinforced concrete in such systems. In this paper, the behavior of composite beam‐column connections is examined through results of an experimental research program where 15 two‐thirds scale joint specimens were tested under monotonic and cyclic loading. Such connections are typically employed in composite framed structures consisting of steel beams and reinforced concrete or composite columns. Significant strength increases were achieved using straightforward details to enhance concrete participation in the joint region. Details considered include the following attachments to the steel beam: vertical stiffener plates, steel columns, welded shear studs, and Dywidag reinforcing bars. The results and discussion presented in this paper provide background for a companion paper that includes a design model for calculating the joint strength.

AB - This is the second of two companion papers addressing the behavior and design of moment connections between structural steel beams and reinforced concrete or composite columns. Due to the traditional separation of steel and concrete design, there is currently a need for guidelines to design such connections. In this paper, a design model and recommendations are presented for detailing and calculating the nominal strength for composite beam‐column joints. The design model is based on two limiting modes of failure: panel shear and bearing of the steel flanges against the concrete. Panel shear strength reflects enhancement achieved through mobilization of the reinforced concrete panel using vertical stiffener (bearing) plates and steel erection columns attached to the steel beam. Bearing strength can be increased by vertical joint reinforcement attached to the steel beam. In the recommendations, detailing considerations for the structural steel and reinforcing bars are included. Finally, calculated results based on the proposed design model are compared with recent tests of composite connections.

AB - This paper proposes a general control system for building structures by active tendons. The practical feasibility of the control system is numerically tested by a discrete‐time mathematical model, which takes into account all the elements in the control loop and provides full information about the solicitations on the elements of the control system. In the numerical experiments two 23‐story buildings—a frame building and a shear‐wall building—are subjected to seismic and wind excitation. To compute the control forces a predictive strategy is considered that includes the time delay of the actuators in its formulation. The results of the numerical experiments prove that active cables combine to create a feasible, reliable, and robust control system for average‐size buildings and that they are more effective in buildings with the dynamics found in shear‐wall buildings.

AB - Abutment piles for a jointless bridge are subjected to lateral displacement as the bridge superstructure expands and contracts. The piles must be designed to satisfy the strength criteria of a structural member and the load transfer requirements and support resistance of the surrounding soil. Two design alternatives for the pile capacity are presented. Results for both design alternatives are shown to be conservative when compared with the solutions obtained from a previously developed finite element model. Alternative one, involving elastic behavior, is recommended for piles with insufficient moment‐rotation capacity, while alternative two, involving inelastic behavior, is recommended for piles having a moment‐rotation capacity that exceeds the moment‐rotation demand at plastic hinge locations. Specific expressions for the ductility requirements for alternative two are specified for both uniaxial and biaxial bending conditions. When the piles have sufficient ductility, alternative two will permit the safe design of integral abutment bridges that are longer than those designed using alternative one.

AB - The shakedown analysis of plane elastoplastic grillage structures for which plasticity is affected by the combined action of bending moment and torsion is formulated using the static or lower bound Bleich‐Melan theorem. Discretization of the structure into finite elements and the nonlinear yield surface into a piecewise linear one, converts the formulation into a linear programming problem that can be solved efficiently using standard packages. How the necessary requirements of equilibrium and yield conformity are satisfied, and how the elastic locus is calculated are also mentioned. A method of identifying whether incremental collapse or alternating plasticity is the governing mode of failure is given. Based on the formulation presented, a FORTRAN computer program named SGRID was written to carry out the shakedown analysis of general planar grillages. Finally, several examples of typical bridge grillages are presented primarily to demonstrate the effect of including torsion in the analyses and also to indicate how easy it is to perform such analyses for practical engineering applications.

AB - Prestressed steel has only recently been considered in the design of structures, despite along, successful history of prestressed concrete structures. Prestressing the steel in a composite steel‐concrete beam increases the load at which the steel beam yields, and also increases the ultimate strength of the composite section. At the same time, precompressing the tension flange reduces the effective stress‐range cycle and improves the fatigue strength. Prestressed composite beams can be used in new structures as well as for the strengthening of existing structures. Several analytical studies of single‐span prestressed composite beams are reported in the literature, but no comprehensive design methodologies are given. This paper presents guidelines and equations for the design of prestressed composite beams in positive‐ and negative‐moment regions. In the positive‐moment region, a steel beam is prestressed first and then compositely connected to concrete deck. In the negative‐moment region, a steel beam is prestressed and then compositely connected to a precast, prestressed concrete deck panel. The guidelines and equations are given for working‐stress and load‐factor design methods and are presented in a manner suitable for easy use by bridge‐design engineers. A design example is also given to demonstrate the benefits of prestressing for strengthening existing bridges.
