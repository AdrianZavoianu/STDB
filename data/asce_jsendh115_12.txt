AB - Natural frequencies and corresponding modal forms for thin‐walled bars of constant and open cross section are examined using the finite element method. Following the classical thin‐walled bar theory, warping and Saint‐Venant torsional rigidities are accounted for. A thin‐walled bar finite element with seven degrees of freedom at each node is adopted, and an explicit, consistent mass matrix of order fourteen is derived. Only small amplitude, linear vibrations are considered in the paper. A generalized eigenproblem is studied, and natural frequencies together with their corresponding vibrational modes are obtained. The convergence and accuracy of the method is tested based on some available closed‐form solutions and on other numerical results. Several examples illustrate the fast convergence of the method when applied to thin‐Walled bars of constant cross sections. Attempts are also made to use this finite element model to examine eigenproblems for thin‐walled bars with variable, open cross section. It is shown, that the method should not be implemented to analyze such bars since piecewise constant (stepped) finite element models may lead to erroneous results.

AB - This paper presents the results of a study of the performance of semirigid steel beam‐to‐column connections under static and cyclic loadings. Tests are reported for connections consisting of top and seat flange angles, and double web angles. In the static tests, initial stiffnesses, and complete moment‐rotation curves are reported for connections of varying dimensions. The geometric parameters that most significantly affect moment‐rotation behavior are determined. The data are compared to analytical models for predicting the initial stiffness and complete nonlinear moment‐rotation relationships for the connections. Hysteretic behavior and fatigue crack propagation characteristics are reported for connections subjected to constant amplitude and variable amplitude cyclic loadings. Empirical low‐cycle fatigue life relationships developed from the constant amplitude test data are applied to a linear damage accumulation model; damage summations predicted by the model are compared to the results of the variable amplitude cyclic tests.

AB - This paper reports on a parametric study of the response of bridge superstructures supported on lead‐rubber bearings when subjected to the 1940 El Centro earthquake (N‐S component) and the 1966 Parkfield earthquake. The effect of parameters such as lead‐plug size and aspect ratio, bearing thickness and yield strength, pier, abutment, and superstructure stiffnesses, and different earthquake records were investigated. The results of the time‐history analyses by Turkington (1987) produced clear trends that are used in the design procedure proposed by Turkington et al. (1987, 1989). The trends showed that the presence of lead shifts the natural period of the structure and increases the amount of damping. The magnitude of the period change and damping decreases as the natural period of the structure increases or as the pier height increases. Lead‐rubber bearings are most effective when used in conjunction with stiff substructures and can be used to redistribute seismic forces between piers and abutments.

AB - This paper presents a design method based on a parametric study by Turkington (1987) of the response of bridge superstructures supported on leadrubber bearings and subjected to the 1940 E1 Centra (N‐S component) and Parkfield earthquakes. The study showed trends of both period shift and additional damping brought about by the inelastic behavior of the lead core in the lead‐rubber bearings, although the two earthquakes introduce different amounts of period shift and additional damping. Two design examples of four‐span bridges with different pier, abutment, and bearing arrangements are presented. The arrangements of leadrubber and elastomeric bearings are used as examples to show how seismic forces can be distributed between piers and abutments.

AB - In the United States, design of steel gable frames normally follows the guidelines prescribed by the American Institute of Steel Construction for assumed wind and gravity loadings. In this study, a pinned‐base steel gable frame structure composed of prismatic members is constructed, and the dynamic characteristics of that structure are investigated using the shaking table. The tests are carried well into the inelastic range so that ultimate lateral strength under seismic excitation can be quantified. It is observed that for such structures the response modification factor adopted by the Applied Technology Council (ATC) should be assumed with caution. In addition, the excessive elastic and inelastic story drifts, which are attributed to the pinned‐base condition, require careful evaluation to ensure structural safety against large sidesways. The excessive story drift is likely one of the major reasons for the severe nonstructural damage of steel gable frames during the 1985 Chile earthquake and the 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake.

AB - This paper presents the yield‐surface diagrams for an I‐section subjected to five active‐stress resultants, including the axial compression, two bending moments, torsion, and bimoment. The difficulties involved in establishing the five‐dimensional yield‐surface equations are circumvented through the adoption of a parametric approach. This approach treats an I‐section as the composition of three thin plates; i.e., one web and two flanges. The entire cross section is considered plastic only when all of its component plates become plastic, with one exception. One advantage to the present approach is that yielding of each component plate can be described by a two‐dimensional yield curve. In developing the yield‐surface diagrams for the I‐section, three yield patterns are identified. The results indicate that neglect of the bimoment effect will overestimate the plastic strength of the I‐section.

AB - Quantitative examples of the hysteretic behavior of an elastic‐plastic bar are presented by making use of the basic equations that have been derived in a preceding paper in a simple closed form. The prismatic bar is subjected repeatedly to axial loading, which may be applied by changes in temperature or forced displacements. Behavioral demonstration is preceded by a brief description of the basic equations with underlying assumptions. Thermal cycling beginning with a rise in temperature can cause bending combined not only with the compressive but also with the tensile force due to plastic deformation in an axially constrained bar. Similarly, a recurring reduction in the distance between the bar ends can bring about bending in combination with tension as well as with compression, and can give rise to an eventual plastic elongation. A comparison of the theoretical behavior to the experimental behavior indicates the validity of the theory as a reasonable first‐order approximation.

AB - Ultimate strength tests on welded thin‐walled steel box columns simply supported at the ends and subjected to biaxial loading are reported. A series of 28 large‐scale box columns of square and rectangular cross section were tested to failure. The parameters that were varied include plate slenderness ratio, column slenderness ratio, cross‐sectional shape, and eccentricity of loading. A description of the specially built test rig along with end fixtures and experimental procedures are also presented. Extensive measurements of welding residual stresses and initial column deflections were made. Stub‐column tests were also carried out. The test results show that the ultimate load‐carrying capacity of columns dropped with an increase in the plate slenderness ratio and an increase in the load eccentricity. The experimental failure loads of the tested columns are compared with the corresponding theoretical values obtained by the method proposed earlier by the writers.

AB - The Imperial County Services Building was severely damaged during the October 15th, 1979, Imperial Valley Earthquake. The vertical load carrying system and the structural systems used to resist lateral forces are described, and the response of the building is presented using reports of observed damage and acceleration histories measured with thirteen strong‐motion accelerographs located throughout the building. In addition, base‐shear and moment histories derived from measured accelerations are presented. Waveforms are examined for indications of when four first‐story columns at the east end of the structure failed. Dynamic forces acting in either of the directions associated with the two primary lateral‐forceresisting systems are examined to show that forces acting solely in one direction were not responsible for failure of four east‐end columns. Response forces acting in both of the primary directions are considered simultaneously to develop a rationale for failure of east‐end columns.

AB - General effective length criteria for cross‐bracing systems are formulated. The criteria entail closed‐form analytic relationships for evaluating compression brace critical load and effective length factor K with due consideration of the relative stiffness and end conditions of the tensile diagonal. Effective length spectra curves are generated to elucidate the criteria and to facilitate design application. Results indicate that the effective length is very sensitive to the relative stiffness of the two interconnected diagonals and, depending on brace end conditions, the effective length factor values range from 0.35 to 1.0. Refereed experimental data available in the range agree well with the proposed solution. Application of the criteria will lead to an optimum design and enhance overall structural stability.

AB - Design analysis of cable networks is presented by converting nonlinear structural analysis into nonlinear programming problems with a systematic classification of networks. Since cable networks are flexible, shapes under different loading conditions can be very different, and considering only the major loading, may not be sufficient for design. Optimization is, thus, made under multiple loading conditions with a variety of important optimization criteria that cannot be considered by the existing methods. To check the feasibility of determinate and indeterminate networks for the proposed shape and the major loading condition, equilibrium equations at nodes are pertinent. For design purposes, this formulation seems much superior to ordinary structural analysis. A few numerical examples are solved to demonstrate the proposed formulation.

AB - This paper deals with the analytical and experimental study of prestressed composite (steel girder with concrete slab) girders. The analysis is done for the case of simply supported bridge girder, using tendon configuration of straight, bent up, and short straight. In the development of the analytical expressions, a perfect shear connection between the concrete slab and the steel girder is assumed and the effects of losses due to creep, shrinkage, tendon relaxation, and residual stresses in the steel beam are not considered. The emphasis is placed on the stress distribution along the span under prestressing effect, and increase in initial tendon force due to application of external load. In this paper “pre‐” refers to stressing the tendon before the concrete slab is added and “post‐” to doing so after the slab is placed and ready to accept load. For this study, two girders of each 19 ft 7 in. (5,969 mm) long are tested. Calculated and observed results are then compared.

AB - The paper investigates, theoretically aand experimentally, the behavior of welded‐tee end connections for circular hollow tubes in tension. Elastic stress distributions around the tube walls below the cap plate are derived. The results show that maximum stresses in the tube below the cleat‐plate corners may be reduced if thicker or narrower cleat plates are used. A total of 21 end connections having various combinations of 8 mm and 12 mm cap and cleat‐plate thicknesses on three tube sizes are tested. The observed first‐yield load, the ultimate load, and the mode of failure are reported for each test specimen. It was found that apart from possible weld defects failure of the end connections is either by local fracture in the tube below the cleat‐plate corners, or by tube yielding if thick enough cap and cleat plates are used. Results reveal that considerable stress redistribution occurs in the test specimens before failure. A simple design approach based on a 60° spread of load through the cap plate is proposed.

AB - This paper presents the test results of three moment‐resisting connections between precast beam‐column elements designed for regions of moderate to high seismicity. The specimens are subjected to cyclic lateral load reversals that are progressively amplified until the structures are taken to inter‐story drifts (ratio of lateral story displacement to story height) exceeding 4%. Two of the test specimens represent exterior connections (BME, BMF), and the third represents an interior connection (BMG). The connections include: BME—bolted, BMF—threaded rebar with ordinary couplers, and BMG—threaded rebar with tapered‐threaded couplers. The plastic hinge is forced to develop within the connection region in all three specimens. The specimens exibit ductility and energy dissipation characteristics similar to those of ordinary reinforced concrete elements, as the connection regions are designed to emulate ordinary reinforced concrete in a precast system. The threaded rebar connections with tapered‐threaded splices represent the most favorable solution in terms of performance, fabrication, and economy.

AB - Bending stresses caused by filling interstice cells in multi-bin reinforced concrete cylindrical silos are analyzed by means of a well-known finite strip solution for various radius-to-thickness and height-to-radius ratios. Numerical results show the influence of height-to-radius ratio in the solutions, setting a limit of that ratio above which bending analysis can be performed with simpler plane frame models with reasonable accuracy. It is shown that for shorter silos the plane frame model departs significantly from a more refined analysis. The finite strip method is shown to be useful for all aspect ratios used in practical applications.
