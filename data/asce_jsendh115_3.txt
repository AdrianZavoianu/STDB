AB - Inadequacies of design, construction, and maintenance associated with shelf angles supporting masonry veneer on structural frames often cause spalling, cracking, and staining of masonry veneer; yielding and slipping of shelf angles; and leakage of wind‐driven rain, which in turn causes corrosion; volume change of materials; freeze‐thaw damage; destructive cryptofluorescence; increased heat transmission; deterioration of interior finishes and building contents; tenant inconvenience; and litigation. In the absence of an expansion joint between the horizontal leg of the shelf angle and the top of the masonry below the angle, differential movement between the building frame and the masonry veneer may lift the shelf angle vertically in a wedge insert in a concrete frame. Mortar rather than sealant in the joint at the toe of the shelf angle and improper shimming of the angle often result in spalled masonry. Shelf angle corrosion may be accelerated by inadequacies in masonry construction, condensation due to exfiltration of interior air, and improper angle protection. Dimension of masonry overhang beyond the toe of the shelf angle is critical.

AB - Railway tracks and bridges are subjected to impact loading in excess of the static weight of the vehicles because of imperfections in the track and vehicle wheels. Current design criteria for concrete tract ties, as required in Chapter 10 of the American Railway Engineering Association's Manual of Railway Engineering, stipulate an “impact factor” of 150% to be applied to the static weight of the vehicles for design of track ties. There are no such provisions for concrete bridge ties or other bridge deck components, e.g., rails, clips, etc., that comprise an open deck railway bridge. Using a full‐scale open deck railway bridge model with nine precast prestressed concrete ties, an analytical‐experimental study was conducted to establish the percentage of impact load transmitted to the individual ties and the influence of some selected parameters on this load. The results showed that the impact loading transmitted to the ties was largely influenced by the shape and stiffness of rail‐tie pad and was independent of the tie support conditions.

AB - This report describes a two‐dimensional finite element model for analyzing vertical and horizontal wood diaphragms. Central to the development of this model is the formulation of a nonlinear finite element that accounts for the distribution and stiffness of fasteners connecting the sheathing to the framing. Linked with conventional beam and plane stress elements, which represent diaphragm framing and sheathing, respectively, the resulting model can be used to analyze a variety of wood diaphragms (walls, floors, ceilings, etc.). Load‐displacement results from experimentally tested diaphragms and model predictions were found to be in good agreement. Parametric studies with the model show that diaphragm stiffness is significantly affected by nail stiffness, nail spacing, and the use of blocking. At code allowable diaphragm shear load levels, a variation of 20% in nail stiffness resulted in a change in diaphragm stiffness of less than 10%. Nail spacing was shown to have a more dominant effect on diaphragm stiffness than nail stiffness.

AB - By means of a correspondence between two systems, each consisting of a space curved bar resting on an external medium, a complete reciprocal formulation of the conjugate structure method is herein presented. The method allows us to transform (internal and external) forces and deformations of one of the two systems into deformations and forces respectively of the conjugate one. This can be done by interchanging the field equilibrium and the mechanical boundary conditions in the two systems with the field compatibility equations and the kinematical boundary conditions and vice versa. The reciprocal correspondence descends from the Principle of Virtual Work and it can be regarded as a particular form of this principle. The Culmann and Ricci ellipse theories and the Cross column analogy are shown as particular aspects of the unified method. The equilibrium, compatibility equations and constitutive laws of the one‐dimensional space member supported on an external medium are derived in a suitable form. An application to influence lines of circular bridge, also taking into account the shear deformation effect, is developed.

AB - A large hyperbolic cooling tower, under construction and nearly completed, was struck by a falling tower crane during a tornado on April 17, 1978. Damage occurred at the upper edge where a V‐shaped notch was gouged. Also, considerable cracking beneath the notch was observed. The extent of the damage was documented by precision survey techniques and visual inspection. A comprehensive analytical study was performed to insure that the completed tower would meet the design criteria. The repair plan involved repairing the cracks, sawing back the notch in a step fashion, refurbishing the scaffolding, rebuilding the gouged region, and then carrying the construction to completion. Also, two circumferential stiffening rings were added to the shell.

AB - A new overall structural flexibility, referred to as “system flexibility,” is defined in this paper for building frames composed of material with an arbitrary, stable, nonlinear, elastic stress‐strain relation which are to be designed to support a set of prescribed lateral loads. The necessary and sufficient conditions for global optimality, and the closed‐form optimum design formula, are derived for the problem of optimum design of a building frame composed of nonlinear elastic beams and linear elastic columns for specified system flexibility. It is shown that, if the cost factors in the optimality conditions are reinterpreted as control parameters for maximum member‐end strains, then the closed‐form optimal design formula derived here can be utilized as a set of practically useful design formulas for ductility design of a building frame consisting of yielding beams (weak beams) and linear elastic columns. It is demonstrated further through a series of time history analyses that this static ductility design method is potentially useful also as a dynamic ductility design method for earthquake loadings.

AB - This paper presents a solution code for mixed‐discrete variable optimization. An optimization algorithm comprising two different techniques, discrete steepest descent and rotating coordinate directions, originally proposed for all discrete optimization, is extended. The extensions have been done in such a way that continuous variables are treated as discrete variables while keeping their continuous nature in the analysis. Several example problems have been solved, three of which are reported. Each example problem is different in nature and in degree of nonlinearity from others. All three example problems reached or almost reached the global optimum. All the practical difficulties (resolution valley, overshooting the optimum, etc.) usually encountered in the discrete or mixed‐discrete optimization are believed to be overcome by the solution code presented herein. The present solution code can effectively be applied to a variety of problems. Details of each technique with the necessary extension and modifications are described.

AB - The effect of skew, anisotropic reinforcement on the post‐cracking response and ultimate capacity of RC membrane elements under monotonically increasing proportional loading is studied. Appropriate constitutive models for concrete and steel, including a post‐cracking model, are implemented in a finite element program. An orthogonally reinforced hypothetical RC panel is analyzed first. Upon initial cracking the anisotropic reinforcement causes the principal stress and strain directions of the cracked concrete shift. These shifts, which also depend on the cracked concrete shear stiffness, may cause additional nonorthogonal cracks to develop in later stages of loading. Anisotropically reinforced experimental panels are then analyzed up to failure. The computed results show good correlation with the experimental data. The influence of cracked concrete shear stiffness on the internal load resisting mechanisms and load‐deformation responses is evaluated. The significance of simulating crack shifting behavior for realistic predictions of stiffness, ultimate capacities, and modes of failure for skew, anisotropically reinforced elements is demonstrated.

AB - A method is presented for analysis of the stresses and strains in plane frames composed of straight noncracked reinforced concrete members with or withour prestressing subjected to large axial forces and/or supported on elastic foundations. The analysis can be performed by the computer program CBC (concrete beam‐columns), which accounts for the stress redistribution in individual sections and the changes in internal forces due to the effects of creep and shrinkage of concrete and relaxation of prestressed steel. The program may be used to verify the stability of frames under sustained loads. It may also be used to calculate the effect of temperature changes which may vary arbitrarily over the depth of the cross sections of members. The effect of differential creep and shrinkage over the depth of section, as may occur in pavements or water storage tanks, is considered.

AB - Light gauge circular silos and tanks are often built from rolled steel plate with lap joints running around the circumference. In this paper, a parametric study is undertaken to explore the problem of the buckling of lap‐jointed cylindrical shells under axial compression and internal pressure using a nonlinear stability analysis for shells of revolution. The results are compared with the predictions of earlier limited analytical studies, and with existing experimental results. Bolted and welded lap joints of different lengths and thicknesses are studied comprehensively. Lap joints are shown to be a source of special concern only if fabrication errors lead to a significant imperfection adjacent to the lap joint. The increase in the buckling strength caused by internal pressure is found to be less than that predicted by the ECCS code for shell buckling.

AB - This paper shows how simply the spatial load carrying action of straight gravity dams in narrow valleys can be accounted for by grid analysis. This explains why in narrow valleys the measured deflections are always smaller than those calculated for independent cantilevers without considering grid action. The deflection of the central cantilever of the 285 m high Grande Dixence Dam in Switzerland is reduced by 27% due to grid action. Because of their construction in blocks and hence the possibility of later joint opening, the horizontal grid beams cannot withstand tension.

AB - Vibration shapes of the fundamental modes of eight‐legged, K‐braced, offshore towers undergo significant changes when important braces are damaged. These changes, measurable at deck‐level, provide valuable clues for detecting damage. Because of the small difference between vibration frequencies of the two fundamental translational modes in these towers, the mode shapes are difficult to measure. A simple method is presented which solves this difficulty. The method uses transient acceleration response records that can be produced by different excitation procedures, and no knowledge of the input that causes the excitation is necessary. The finite Fourier transform of such records is examined, and its important properties are pointed out for low damping. Based on these properties, procedures are set forth by which mode shape data can be retrieved from closely spaced peaks in response spectra. The retrieval is done by separating these peaks from each other. Applications of the method in a numerical experiment, and in a physical experiment on a l/50th scale offshore platform model, are presented. Application of the method to full‐scale towers is discussed.

AB - Assuming force method analysis formulation, the effect of compatibility conditions on optimal design of trusses is studied. Neglecting the latter conditions, a linear programming (LP) formulation is obtained. The possibility of applying prestressing forces by “lack of fit” to maintain compatibility at the LP optimum is demonstrated. It has been shown that for structures subjected to a single loading condition, the LP lower‐bound solution is the final optimum. Prestressing might be required to maintain compatibility in cases where the optimal solution represents a statically indeterminate structure. The various possible solutions for structures subjected to multiple loading conditions are discussed. It is shown that under certain circumstances, compatibility conditions can be satisfied at the LP optimum only by applying different sets of prestressing forces for the various loadings. For certain geometries, the LP solution represents multiple optimal topologies, part of them being statically determinate structures. In such cases, the LP lower‐bound solution is the final optimum, and no prestressing is required to maintain compatibility. In cases where compatibility conditions considerably affect the solution, prestressing by lack of fit might significantly improve the final optimum.
