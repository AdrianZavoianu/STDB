AB - The trend towards more slender and lighter building structures has resulted in potentially more significant P‐delta effects; this has led to the demand for simple and accurate methods of P‐delta analysis. Methods are reviewed and compared in terms of their efficiency and accuracy. Considered roughly in their order of sophistication, the methods reviewed include the amplification factor method, the direct method, the iterative method, the negative property member methods, and the second‐order computer program method. In addition to these, a new method similar to the iterative method, but based on analyses using the actual gravity loading applied to successive deflected shapes, is presented. The results are identical to those given by the iterative method, while the analysis takes less than one‐third of the time. Factors that differentiate the methods include their accuracy, ease of use, whether they are for hand or computer use, and whether they are applicable to all types of structures or only to certain types.

AB - Analytical formulation of constitutive equations for a single crack is made, which relates the shear and normal stresses to the corresponding displacements. The modeling of four basic coefficients involved in the constitutive matrix is discussed, and their constants are identified making use of experimental data available from existing literatures. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed model can represent essential characteristics of a crack such as nonlinear shear transfer, aggregate interlock, crack dilatancy, and path‐dependence. It is found that off‐diagonal terms in the constitutive matrix characterized by dilatancy ratio and frictional coefficient play an important role in the shear transfer mechanism depending on constraint condition normal to the crack direction. This is regarded as cross‐effect. The proposed model can also satisfactorily predict experimentally obtained results concerning shear‐stress displacement relation andn accompanied compressive normal stress and crack opening.

AB - A test program is described investigating the compressive strength of channel section columns of slender cross section. The program consisted of different geometries of cross section, each fabricated by welding from high‐strength steel. Specimens were tested both concentrically and eccentrically between pinned ends, and for each section geometry, fixed‐ended stub column tests were also performed. Additional tests were performed to determine the local buckling load of the sections under uniform compression. The different behavior of the columns that were pinned or fixed at the ends is described, including the effect of the change in the position of the internal force after local buckling of the sections. Data on the test sections described in the paper include models of the measured residual stress distributions resulting from fabrication, the local geometric imperfection components measured in the plates after fabrication, and the measured imperfections in the shape of the overall flexural buckling mode. The test strengths are compared with predictions of the AISC Load and Resistance Factor Design Specification, the draft Limit State Australian Standard, the British Standard BS5950, Part I, and the Eurocode3 Specification for the design of steel structures. Conclusions regarding the accuracy of different specifications and standards are given in the paper.

AB - The response of shallow‐buried reinforced concrete arches under the effects of severe pressure‐time histories that are applied to the free surface is addressed, examined, and discussed. Results from, primarily, three test series are presented and evaluated in light of the known structural behavior and conclusions are drawn about the response of these structures. In the first part of the paper, the writers present the background for the problem and a general overview of past research activities in this area. In the second part of the paper, the emphasis is on four tests, which are presented and discussed in detail. The observed behavioral differences between different types of arches, the effects of two major sources of dynamic loads, and soil‐structure interaction are considered. The conclusions drawn herein are aimed at providing insight into the behavior of buried reinforced concrete arches under dynamic loads and some thoughts on future research in this important area.

AB - Posting and epoxy grouting to repair timber piles consists of cutting out the deteriorated section of the pile and replacing it with a new treated pile section. The butt ends of the old and new sections are epoxy‐grouted to produce a permanent bond. To evaluate the effectiveness of this repair procedure, a fouryear study is conducted. In addition to laboratory testing to evaluate strength characteristics of repaired piles, field repair is conducted at a U.S. Forest Service bridge in Louisiana. The bridge is monitored for four years to measure deformations and to track deterioration. During this period no significant deflections occur and there are no signs of decay or debonding. Based on this study, recommendations for the design of posted and epoxy‐grouted piles are given in terms of modified allowable stresses.

AB - The earthquake response of torsionally coupled buildings is presented for a wide range of system parameters. Based on these results, it is demonstrated that the building response depends significantly on the static eccentricity ratio e/r, the uncoupled torsional to lateral frequency ratio Ω, the beam‐to‐column stiffness ratio ρ, and the uncoupled, fundamental, lateral vibration period Ty1. It is concluded that the response contributions of the higher vibration modal pairs increase with increasing Ty1. and decreasing ρ. However, if Ty1. is in the accelerationor velocity‐controlled regions of the earthquake design spectrum, the first two vibration modal pairs are sufficient to estimate the response to a useful degree of accuracy; the fundamental vibration modal pair suffices if Ty1. is in the acceleration‐controlled region of the spectrum.

AB - Renaissance ogival domes of unreinforced stone masonry can be analyzed as structures of rigid material with no tensile strength. Solutions can be obtained for the static equilibrium of the structure; the results represent an extension or variant to membrane shell theory. A limiting shell thickness is found at which a kinematic collapse mechanism develops. The limit state analysis also identifies the role of hoop stress in permitting the construction of such a shell without centering. The analysis has its counterpart in a study published in 1742, that being the first modern structural analysis. The analysis procedure shows the clear relation between geometry (shell shape) and internal forces.

AB - A methodology is developed to perform nonlinear postbuckling analysis of steel space truss systems. Structural behavior is modeled at the element level through appropriate stress‐strain relationships. Nonlinearities due to member buckling or yielding are modeled using a tangent modulus in the evaluation of the element elastic stiffness matrix. First‐order geometric effects‐are included using a geometric stiffness matrix. Second‐order effects are included through a corotational coordinate transformation formulation. An incremental/iterative solution strategy utilizing modified Newton‐Raphson iterations with a constant arc‐length constraint is presented. Both pre‐ and postcritical regions of the structure load‐deflection path can be traced with the strategy. Results are obtained and compared for linear and nonlinear material behavior along with second‐order geometric nonlinearity. The generated results provide information on the failure mechanisms most critical to a particular truss system, and techniques which can be used to reduce the effects of the failure mechanisms are described.

AB - During the 1971 San Fernando earthquake the superstructure hinge seats of bridges pulled apart and collapses unsued at sites of strong ground shaking. The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) has since installed hinge diaphragm cable restrainers which inhibit the relative longitudinal displacements across the hinges. The strength, stiffness, and cyclic load‐deflection behavior of bridges which have been retrofit with longitudinal cable restrainers are determined. The properties were evaluated in a full‐scale structure experimental test program conducted at the University of California at Los Angeles. The test results show that the measured capacity or strength of the retrofitted system is slightly greater than the design yield load for the restrainers, and that failure occurs in the reinforced concrete hinge diaphragm due to deterioration resulting from combined bending and punching shear.

AB - A study of soil‐structure interaction for seismically excited simple structures is made considering both kinematic and inertial interaction effects. The information and concepts presented elucidate the nature and relative importance of the two effects and make it possible to assess readily the influences of the more important parameters. The response quantities examined are the ensemble means of the peak values of the lateral and torsional components of the foundation input motion and of the associated structural deformations. The results are evaluated over wide ranges of the parameters involved and are compared with those obtained for no soil‐structure interaction and for kinematic interaction only. Simple, physically motivated interpretations are given for the observed differences. For the important special case of vertically incident incoherent waves, simple closed‐form approximate expressions are presented for the transfer functions of circular massless foundations.

AB - The objective of this study is to develop a unified model for the postcracking behavior of a reinforced concrete element under tension‐compression. Such a model would consider the steel‐concrete interface interaction, the concrete compression‐tension failure interaction, and the constitutive properties of the materials. The model would unify the major concepts underlying the limit‐state design models, analysis models, and the phenomenological models developed to simulate test results. The present paper presents the first part of the study, a post‐cracking model that includes the tension‐stiffness effect by considering the steel‐concrete interface interaction. Reinforcing bars transfer tensile stresses to the concrete through bond stresses at the steel‐concrete interface. It is assumed that the bond stress‐slip relationship remains linear. The formulation leads to a strain‐stress relationship for the reinforced concrete element including the tension‐stiffness effect. Expressions in the relationship are quite complex, which are greatly simplified when the Poisson ratio is zero. The complete unified theory and its application are given in a companion paper.

AB - A recurring procedural flaw exists in many textbook treatments of approximate methods for the analysis of rectangular, rigid frames under uniform vertical loading. The majority of textbooks surveyed cite an inappropriate assumption regarding the approximate analysis of vertically loaded frames which leads to erroneous solutions. One of the prevalent assumptions, which leads to incorrect shear forces and bending moments in columns, is that a negligible axial force exists in each girder. A more appropriate first-pass substitute might be to assume that inflection points occur in each column at mid-height, or at hinged supports of column bases at ground level. Using a simple, uniformly loaded, symmetric, rectangular frame as an example (this frame appears frequently in textbook examples), a trial revised set of assumptions produces an improved approximate solution. Work is proceeding to develop a fully tested, revised method of approximate structural analysis for vertically loaded rectangular frames.
