AB - Seismic tests on a full‐scale six‐story steel building have been conducted as part of the U.S.‐Japan Joint Research Program. The first phase of this research includes extensive tests on a concentrically braced frame, and detailed results of these tests are described. The concentrically braced frame is tested for elastic, moderate, and final tests. The elastic test simulates a small, frequent earthquake, and the structure remains elastic throughout the test. The moderate test simulates an intermediate‐size earthquake. Limited yielding and brace buckling and an unusual three‐piece tear in the web of the beam at the second floor brace beam splice are noted. This unusual failure is analyzed and is compared to U.S. design practice. The final test simulates a major earthquake, and extensive brace buckling and yielding are noted. The distribution of energy dissipation within the structure is analyzed for both the moderate and final tests. The effect of brace buckling and composite action of the floor system on the seismic behavior is studied. The results of the experiments are correlated to U.S. design practice, and design recommendations are made.

AB - A full‐scale eccentrically braced dual frame building is tested under the U.S.‐Japan Cooperative Earthquake Research Program Utilizing Large‐Size Testing Facilities. The strength of the building is almost three times greater than the design capacity based on the 1979 and 1982 UBC provisions. The building possesses excellent ductility and energy absorbing capacity, although the energy absorption is concentrated mainly in the lower three stories. Although the excess strength possessed by the building contributes to its excellent behavior, it also leads to premature failure in several connections and large uplift forces in the columns of the braced bay. The performance of the full‐scale building is evaluated and implications that these results have for the design of eccentrically braced frames are presented.

AB - A six‐story concentrically chevron‐braced dual steel system is subjected to 20 earthquake ground motions with effective peak accelerations of up to 0.40 g on the earthquake simulator at the University of California at Berkeley. The design of the structure has been reviewed in accordance with the 1979 Uniform Building Code. The construction, dynamic characteristics, and experimental behavior of this test model are discussed. The structural strength is reached after severe buckling and ruptures of the concentric braces. The reduction of elastic strength demand due to developed ductility is on the order of 1.5. A substantial overstrength on the order of 2.4 with respect to the nominal yielding strength of the structure is observed and its importance is discussed in terms of the values of the response modification factor adopted by the Applied Technology Council (ATC). Based upon the test results, the role of the ductile moment‐resisting space frame in the dual system is discussed. Conclusions are drawn regarding the suitability of the response modification factors recommended by ATC. To prevent and/or to delay severe buckling and rupture of the braces, improvement in their proportioning for this type of system is suggested.

AB - The testing of a 0.305 scale model of a six‐story prototype steel building under a program of controlled cycle displacements is described. A “wiffle tree” system was used to produce a lateral load pattern closely resembling the pattern specified by the Uniform Building Code (UBC). The testing was carried out with three lateral load‐resisting schemes: (1) Dual systems with concentric braces; (2) dual systems with eccentric braces; and (3) moment‐resisting space frame. The overall performance of the three systems is discussed, and the test results are compared with theoretical predictions.

AB - The seismic test results on a full‐scale six‐story, 2 by 2 bay, steel building with concentric‐K braces forming a “dual system” are reported. The steel building was constructed at the Large Size Structure Laboratory of the Building Research Institute of the Japanese Ministry of Construction and the seismic tests were run as a six‐degree‐of‐freedom pseudo‐dynamic system (on‐line computer system) to ascertain the ultimate lateral load‐carrying capacity and deformability of the full‐scale structure. The test results illustrate not only the capacity of the pseudo‐dynamic testing technique but also the importance of the precise prediction of the interaction of the post‐buckling behavior of the bracing members including local failure of them and the elasto‐plastic behavior of the moment‐resisting frames. The test results also show that the three‐dimensional effects in the test building cannot be ignored if an accurate estimate of the elastic story stiffness of the test structure is to be achieved.

AB - This paper compares analytical predictions with a series of full‐scale seismic tests on a concentrically K‐braced six‐story steel structure. A computer program for the inelastic frame analysis is used to calculate the dynamic response of the test structure, in which the degrading hysteresis rule is applied to the postbuckling brace model. From a comparison of the analytical and experimental results, it is concluded that the overall and local behavior of the full‐scale test structure subjected to simulated earthquakes can be reasonably well represented by using the implemented model and analytical method. It should, however, be noted that the overall hysteresis behavior and the damage distribution of the K‐braced structure are very sensitive to the differences in the hysteresis characteristics of each bracing member. A simple analysis with a lumped mass shear‐type model is also conducted to compare the responses between this design‐level analysis and the experimental results.

AB - A full‐size, six‐story, two‐bay steel structure with eccentric bracing was tested by a pseudodynamic method at the Building Research Institute, Tsukuba, Japan, during January—March 1984. The S21W 1952 Taft accelerogram was used in the elastic and inelastic tests with peak accelerations scaled to 65 and 500 gal, respectively. The structure represents phase 2 of the steel program under the U.S.‐Japan Cooperative Earthquake Research Program. The paper presents results from the pretest and refined posttest analyses. Comparisons are made with the measured global response of the structure in the elastic and inelastic level tests. The agreement between results from the refined posttest analyses and those from the tests is excellent. The analytical modeling of the structural elements is presented. The influence of various parameters upon the response is also discussed.

AB - Bracing members in concentrically braced structures may be subjected to large cyclic deformations in post‐buckling range during a severe earthquake causing possible early fractures. This paper investigates the phenomenon and presents an empirical criterion to predict the fracture of rectangular tubular bracing members. The criterion includes two parts: normalizing axial deformation cycles into standard cycles, and predicting the fracture life of the bracing members in terms of the standard cycles. The criterion is incorporated into DRAIN‐2DM, a general purpose computer program for dynamic analysis of inelastic structures. The U.S.‐Japan Phase I test structure, a six‐story, two‐bay by two‐bay steel structure with concentric bracing, is analyzed using the criterion and analytical results are compared with the test results.

AB - Replica models of three beam‐column assemblies and a six‐story braced frame specimen were constructed at a scale of 1:12.5. These models were then tested using the same displacement histories as corresponding prototype tests. A comparison of the model and prototype test results indicates that small‐scale models can be used to predict global elastic and inelastic behavior of structures very well. Localized failure modes were simulated with less accuracy, with the model specimens generally exhibiting slower deterioration in strength and stiffness than the prototype. General conclusions about the behavior of dual steel structural systems with chevron braces are given. Conclusions are drawn on the feasibilities and limitations of small‐scale testing in earthquake engineering.

AB - This paper deals with the seismic behavior of an inverted‐V‐braced structure with braces of intermediate slenderness (L/r=70-120). These are often designed as earthquake‐resistant elements of low‐ and middle‐rise buildings. The post‐buckling behavior of the brace and the interaction between the brace and the braced bay beam mainly affect the total seismic behavior of the frame. These effects are discussed by using the experimental results on the half‐sealed three‐story models of the inverted‐V‐braced system which were carried out at the Building Research Institute, the Ministry of Construction, Japanese Government, as part of the U.S.‐Japan Cooperative Earthquake Research Program Utilizing Large‐Scale Testing Facilities. Based on these findings, a simple but reasonable hysteresis model for the inverted‐V‐braced systems is proposed to predict the hysteretic lateral shear force versus inter‐story drift relation of the structural system.

AB - The behavior of composite floor beams in eccentrically braced steel frames (EBFs) subjected to severe cyclic loading was experimentally investigated. The objectives of this study were to assess the cyclic strength and ductility of links in composite floor systems, and to determine the extent of the floor‐slab participation in the response of EBFs to earthquake loading. Six short links with a composite floor slab, and two short, bare steel links were tested using two‐thirds‐scale EBF subassemblies. The composite links, designed using current provisions for short, bare steel links, were found to yield and dissipate energy primarily in shear, and have a greater cyclic capacity compared to bare steel links. Web buckling in the composite links was adequately controlled using bare‐steel‐link design criteria to assure cyclic ductility. The extent of slab damage in the composite specimens was remarkably small and occurred primarily in the vicinity of the link. The test results indicate that the floor slab by itself does not provide adequate lateral bracing at the ends of the link.

AB - The influence of displacement rates on elastic‐plastic behaviors of structural members was investigated using dynamic tests and quasi‐static tests. Monotonic and cyclic reversed tests of steel beams and fully composite beams were conducted at three displacement rates: 0.15 cm/s, 15 cm/s and 30 cm/s. Significant differences in the maximum moment capacities of steel beams and composite beams were found between the quasi‐static and dynamic behavior under both monotonic and cyclic loadings. The elastic stiffness and the unloading stiffness in the plastic range were not influenced by the displacement rates. Although deformation capacities of steel beams tended to increase slightly with an increase in displacement rates, no substantial qualitative differences were observed under either monotonic or cyclic loadings. In this paper viscous damping of steel beams in the elastic range is also discussed in order to clarify the increase in the maximum moment capacities.

AB - The hysteretic loops of the embedded‐type column‐to‐footing connection, subjected to seismic loading, can be classified into three types, namely (1) Elastic‐plastic with sufficient deformability; (2) pinching type with large deformability; and (3) pinching type with poor deformability. Fracture modes of the types are: type A, where a plastic hinge is formed in the steel column at the top surface of the footing; type C, where punching shear failure of the footing concrete occurs, in which the side wall breaks out laterally at the girder‐free side of the footing, preceding the yielding of the column member; or type B, which is a combined mode of types A and C. The maximum strength of the connections of type C is analyzed theoretically based on the test results hitherto reported in Japan. And, to ensure avoiding failure in type C, a design guide for details of the connection is presented, together with a parametric study.

AB - This paper presents investigations into the capacity of the pseudodynamic (PSD) test to simulate the earthquake response of structures. First, algorithms developed for improving the displacement control in the PSD test are introduced. Second, the correlation between shake table and PSD tests is examined using a two story steel frame. It is found that the overall correlation is good, but that the restoring force is larger in the shake table test than in the PSD test. A supplemental test verified that the effect of loading rate is responsible for the difference in the restoring force. Third, experimental error behavior is examined based on an elastic PSD test applied to the full‐scale six story steel structure. The displacement error is found to be the major source that promotes higher mode vibration in the PSD response, and characteristics of the displacement error as well as its effects on the PSD response are investigated.

AB - A major concern in seismic performance testing is whether the loading conditions imposed on a test specimen are representative of those that might occur during an actual earthquake. An on‐line computer‐controlled experimental procedure has been recently developed that appears to combine the simplicity of quasistatic testing with the realism of shaking table tests. The basis of this so called pseudodynamic test method is summarized in this paper. Recent research results are examined to identify the method's capabilities and limitations. Efforts to extend the applicability of the method are highlighted.
