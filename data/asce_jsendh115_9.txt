AB - In this paper, nonhomogeneous Markov chains are proposed for modeling the cracking behavior of reinforced concrete beams subjected to monotonically increasing loads. The model facilitates prediction of the maximum crackwidth at a given load given the crackwidth at a lower load level, and thus leads to a better understanding of the cracking phenomenon. To illustrate the methodology developed, the results of three reinforced concrete beams tested in the laboratory are analyzed and presented.

AB - The placement of the concrete deck and the attachment of adjacent girders and diaphragms is generally not considered in the design of horizontally curved bridges unless the entire bare steel structure has been completely constructed and is an integral unit. The supporting of the individual girders prior to attachment of diaphragms is an important control within the construction phase in that shoring may be necessary for stability. Contained herein are general guidelines, that apply to various popular erection schemes, to prevent overstress during construction. The guidelines are determined via a parametric study that quantifies the effect that the top and bottom lateral bracing has upon the stress levels within the main girder elements. The study examines the response of a single‐span, twogirder, curved I‐girder system subjected to its own self‐weight. Multigirder bridges are also examined to determine the effect that the placement of a concrete deck slab has upon the response of the curved girder with the top and bottom lateral bracing system for a representative range of span lengths and radii. Two‐ and threespan, continuous, curved braced bridges are also examined to determine the effect of lateral bracing on the stress levels on main girder elements. The final results are in the form of equations that define the dead load distributions throughout the superstructure system. These equations can be used in conjunction with the results given by the two‐dimensional grid analysis method, which is often used to analyze and design curved bridges.

AB - Most existing structural seismic damage measures are based either implicitly or explicitly on some measure of the maximum ductility attained or desired, or on peak acceleration. In this paper, two completely new damage measures are described, one based on the concept of equivalent hysteretic cycles of deformation and the second on concepts derived from low‐cycle fatigue theory. When combined, these techniques permit one to evaluate damage based not only on ductility principles, but also on the repetitive cyclic nature of the deformation response. Examples of the applicability of the damage measures are presented herein through comparisons with published experimental data, in which the recorded responses include hysteretic behavior. Two other types of possible applications also are demonstrated; namely, construction of response spectra for representing nonlinear effects, and a tentative new approach to building code drift limits. Other applications are obvious, such as evaluating remaining margins of strength. It is believed that the simplicity of the approaches, when adapted to specific applications, will make them especially attractive in the future for applications in practice as well as for research purposes.

AB - In the eastern United States, reinforced concrete building structures, medium‐ to high‐rise construction, are usually designed for gravity loads only. A damage evaluation was done in this study for typical structures of medium height using inelastic dynamic analysis and artificially simulated earthquake motion. An empirical relation was developed to provide quick assessment for the expected damage in medium‐high, reinforced concrete structures. The paper presents the methodology used for this evaluation, including the simulation of artificial ground motion from eastern United States data, and describes the major factors influencing damageability.

AB - The seismic resistance of story‐height reinforced masonry shear walls has been evaluated experimentally to examine the influence of the applied axial stress and the amount of vertical and horizontal reinforcement on the lateral resistance, failure mechanism, ductility, and energy‐dissipation capability of a wall panel. The results obtained from 16 concrete masonry specimens are summarized in this paper. It has been shown that the flexural strength increases with the applied axial stress and the amount of the vertical reinforcement present. The shear strength dominated by diagonal cracking increases with the amount of vertical and horizontal steel, as well as with the tensile strength of masonry and the applied axial stress. However, the axial stress has a more significant influence on the flexural strength than on the shear strength. Furthermore, increasing the amount of vertical and horizontal reinforcement can substantially improve the postcracked ductility and energy‐dissipation capability of a shear‐dominated specimen.

AB - The behavior and analysis of bolted flange plate connections in rectangular hollow section tension members is considered, with the bolts along only two opposite sides of the rectangular hollow section. Sixteen tension tests on such connections are described, and it is shown that one can, by selecting specific connection parameters, fully develop the tensile resistance of the member by bolting along only two sides of the tube. The application of traditional prying models developed for T‐stubs is found to not correlate well with the test results, so analytical models based on plastic theory are consequently proposed, and these are found to predict the failure mode and the joint ultimate strength to within 6%.

AB - The tension leg platform (TLP) is a large, floating offshore platform for producing oil and gas in deep water. The TLP is moored to the ocean floor by vertical tethers. Loads in the tethers have several components that are timevariant and non‐Gaussian. Therefore, conventional methods of reliability analysis typically applied to fixed offshore platforms are not applicable to TLP tethers. This paper presents a method for probabilistic combination of time‐variant (Gaussian and non‐Gaussian) and time‐invariant tether load components. The procedure is applied to a Gulf of Mexico TLP design where the environmental hazard is due to hurricane events. Two modes of failure are considered for the TLP tethers: (1) The maximum lifetime tension exceeds the yield load; and (2) the minimum lifetime tension is less than zero, i.e., the tethers experience the loss of tension. The resulting TLP tether reliability is compared to the calculated reliability of conventional fixed offshore platforms, which form the basis of industry experience.

AB - Four half‐scale R.C. interior beam‐column joints were tested to assess the validity of current anchorage provisions for interior beam‐column joints. The specimens had beam bars with anchorage lengths of 16, 20, 24, and 28 bar diameters through the joint. The tests show that anchorage length is as important as shear stress in design, and that there is no experimental evidence to support lowering the current anchorage requirements of 20 bar diameters. Current design recommendations are adequate for moderate earthquakes, but would probably lead to significant stiffness and strength losses under a major earthquake. The data on bar slippage and anchorage indicate that 24 bar diameters is very close to the ideal anchorage length for interior beam‐column joints.

AB - This paper examines the horizontal bed joint shear failure mode and the shear load‐displacement behavior of unreinforced brick masonry during static and cyclic loading. Laboratory tests are conducted on masonry samples using a servo‐controlled direct shear apparatus. A total of 44 tests are conducted on old clay unit‐1:2:9 mortar specimens and 9 tests on new clay unit‐1:1.5:4.5 mortar specimens (laboratory specimens). In addition, three tests are conducted on field specimens collected from older brick walls damaged during the Whittier earthquake. In general, under cyclic shear loading, masonry bed joints show a peak strength for the first cycle followed by residual shear strength. Both peak and residual shear strengths are well represented by the Mohr Coulomb criterion, with friction coefficients ranging between 0.64 and 0.75 for the laboratory specimens. The field specimens show lower shear strength values. The pre‐peak response of masonry bed joints can best be represented by a hyperbolic curve and their shear stiffness depends on both the shear displacement and normal load level.

At this writing, on‐site wind and vibration measurements are continuing. The present paper examines the effectiveness of the post‐construction modifications for avoiding excessive aeroelastic response. The paper describes a finite element analysis of this rather complicated bridge and the inferences drawn therefrom. The study is a part of ongoing research into methods for both sharpening and corroborating the prediction of the wind response of flexible bridges. The present study confirms the efficacy of cable bracing added to the original bridge by its designer with the aim of defending it against wind‐induced oscillation.

At this writing, both on‐site wind and vibration measurements are continuing. The present paper makes use of some of the currently available data from this survey and incorporates it with results of finite element analyses of the bridge to define with some accuracy a number of its prominent modes. The study is a part of ongoing research into methods for both sharpening and corroborating the prediction of the wind response of flexible bridges. The present research project also incidentally confirms the efficacy of cable bracing added to the bridge by its designer with the aim of defending it against wind‐induced oscillation. The results reported herein indicate that the computed frequencies and mode shapes using finite element modeling are in reasonable agreement with the results of the field‐data analysis. In addition to providing a comparison of computed parameters versus those observed in the field, the paper serves the purpose of establishing some information needed in using the Deer Isle field data in wind‐buffeting research.

AB - In this paper, a rate‐independent constitutive model for plain concrete is proposed for application to the analysis of impulse‐loaded structural members. The model combines a continuum damage approach, using a scalar damage variable, with a pressure‐sensitive plasticity model. The plasticity model incorporates a nonassociated flow rule in regions of low compressive or tensile hydrostatic pressures and an associated flow rule elsewhere; the possibility of energy generation through use of a nonassociated flow rule is avoided through modification of the flow rule relations. Strain softening is also included and the deleterious side effects (i.e., mesh dependency and unreasonable energy dissipation) are avoided through use of a nonlocal definition of the damage parameter. The concrete model is combined with a uniaxial steel model and a layered, large‐strain, Timoshenko beam element to perform the analysis of impulse‐loaded, simply supported, reinforced‐concrete beams.

AB - The concept of prestressing steel structures has only recently been widely considered, despite a long and successful history of prestressing concrete members. Several analytical studies of prestressed composite beams were reported in the literature, but much of that work was not experimentally verified. In particular, no test results were found on prestressed composite beams subjected to negative bending moment. This paper examines experimentally the behavior of prestressed, composite steel‐concrete beams. Two beams were tested, one subjected to positive bending moment and the other to negative bending moment. The load was plotted against the deflection, and the strains in the concrete, steel beam, and prestressing bars. The values predicted with the equations of internal force equilibrium and compatibility between the deformations of the bars and the composite beam were found to correlate well with the measured data.

AB - This paper analyzes the behavior of steel beams prestressed with highstrength steel tendon and compositely connected to a concrete deck. In particular, the deflection and the strains in the steel beam, concrete deck, and tendons are calculated in the positive and negative bending moment regions, over the full range of loading to failure. Three types of composite beams are considered: (1) Conventional composite beam without prestressing tendon; (2) composite beam with tendons anchored at the ends, but not prestressed; and (3) composite beam with tendons prestressed. The load‐deflection and the load‐strain behavior of these beams are compared. The analysis shows that the ultimate and the yield loads can be increased substantially by adding high‐strength tendons to the composite beams and prestressing them.

AB - The longitudinal stiffness of the bridge abutments is a parameter extensively used for the dynamic analysis of bridges because it affects the longitudinal vibration of the bridge deck. In this paper, a simple method is presented for the evaluation of a force displacement diagram of bridge abutments. For the development of the method, it is assumed that the abutment can be represented as a uniform rigid plate and the soil deposits on the two sides of the abutment as Winkler foundation with elastic springs linearly varying with depth. For the evaluation of the yielding of the abutment springs, the Rankine Theory of Active Thrust and Passive Resistance is used. The application of the method is demonstrated with the evaluation of the force‐displacement diagram of the abutments of a bridge located in Riverside, California.

AB - Shape optimal design of an elastic double-curved arch dam is treated using a continuum shape design sensitivity analysis method. Derivatives of the stress at the surface of the dam with respect to shape design parameters are computed using the material derivative. The upstream and downstream surfaces of the arch dam are parameterized by Bezier surfaces. The total volume of the arch dam is minimized, subjecting to the constraints on thickness of the dam and maximum tensile and compressive stresses.
