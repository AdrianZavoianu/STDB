AB - The aeroelastic response of cable‐stayed bridges to wind is a complex interaction of aerodynamic loading and coupled structural motion. The present paper presents an empirically based analysis method for such structures, based on a flutter‐derivative formulation. The principal perceived advantage of the approach adopted herein is that the full three‐dimensional complexities of the system may be incorporated, while retaining insight into the physical mechanisms involved. Two examples, covering the erection and completed stages of a twin‐deck structure, are presented and discussed. Correlation of the method with three‐dimensional wind‐tunnel tests is presented. Finally, attention is given to the effects of turbulence in the incoming wind; the flutter‐derivative approach is successfully used to explain phenomena observed in full‐scale tests and in practice.

AB - The inelastic behavior of tee‐beam sections at exterior reinforced concrete beam‐column connections subjected to earthquake loading is investigated using a three‐dimensional truss analog. This model accounts for the spatial characteristics of the response of connections, including effects of flexible transverse beams. In the analysis, longitudinal and transverse beams are modeled by line elements, and the slab is modeled by a truss connecting the longitudinal and transverse beams. The analytical model indicates that the behavior of the longitudinal beam is strongly influenced by flexural and torsional deformations in the spandrel beams. Computed results are compared to experimental results.

AB - The paper presents a more accurate solution for the elastic, lateral‐torsional buckling of I‐beams under unequal end moments which incorporates accurately the effects of moment gradient, lateral end restraint, and beam slender‐ness. Since lateral‐torsional buckling involves warping and torsional modes of deformation, the proposed approach treats the problem as the superposition of two hypothetical cases of beam buckling corresponding to zero warping and zero torsional rigidity. The effects of moment gradient and lateral end restraints are considered independently on each mode and then superimposed to obtain the critical moment of the combined mode. The proposed analytical model is used to derive new parametric expressions for moment modification and effective length factors as design aids.

AB - The paper presents the analytical solution to the system of differential equations governing behavior of reinforcing‐bar anchorage under generalized excitations. The solution uses a bilinear model for steel and assumes a local bond‐stress‐slip relation expressed by exponential monomial functions (solution by series of functions) or by linear functions (closed‐form solution). On the basis of physical behavior, a thorough analysis is made of slip and steel‐strain functions. Explanation is also given for the pattern of the steel‐strain function in the portion of bar that has yielded during the previous cyclic strain history. A solution procedure is presented that uses the slip and steel‐strain functions and requires very small computational effort with respect to traditional procedures. The accuracy of the analytical solution is shown by means of a practical application to a reinforcing bar anchored in a beam‐column joint already examined in the literature.

AB - The behavior of damaged concrete beams strengthened by externally bonded steel plates is analytically investigated using linear elastic fracture mechanics and the finite element method. The study includes investigation of the failure by interface debonding of the steel plate and the adhesive layer due to interfacial shear stress which exists at the interface. The principles of the conservation law of elasticity are used to determine the critical strain energy release rate required to cause the interfacial crack to propagate. Simply supported beams under monotonically increasing symmetrical loads are considered exclusively. It is found that the failure by debonding is dependent on the stress near the interfacial crack tip and on the critical strain energy release rate required for crack propagation. For the beam size [4×4×96in. (101.6×101.6×2,438.4mm)] and the loading configuration [two symmetrical point loads spaced 24 in. (609.4 mm) apart] studied in this investigation, the results indicates that the most critical case occurs when five flexural cracks exist within a short region in the midspan of the beam. Furthermore, the results suggest that critical separation of debonding load is relatively insensitive to the thickness of the adhesive layer for the range of thickness [0.1&lt;0.25in. (2.59&lt;t&lt;6.35mm)] studied in this investigation.

AB - A methodology to develop analytically the deflection function characterizing the behavior of bridge decks in which the concrete slab rests on top of a network of steel beams is presented. The systems analyzed are categorized as ribbed plate systems, where the beams are parallel to the longitudinal span of the decking, and grid plate systems, where the slab is supported on a beam grid system. The plate systems are analyzed using an energy‐based approach, where polynomial functions are used to model deflections and moments in the slab. In the analysis only plates that are simply supported on two edges and that are subjected to particular types of uniformly distributed and concentrated load patterns are considered. Sufficient cases are analyzed, and prediction equations for maximum bending moments and deflections of the slab are developed using regression analysis procedure.

AB - The 1986 edition of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) specification adopted the unified approach for evaluating the postbuckling capacity of partially stiffened plate elements in cold‐formed sections. The criteria for design of sections with partially stiffened flanges, however, have been based mostly on research dealing with stiffeners located perpendicular to the flanges—a situation that is not representative of a large number of cross‐sections in use today. In the present paper, the AISI design criteria for cold‐formed sections with sloping edge stiffeners are reviewed and evaluated through comparison with experimental data obtained in a test program involving 46 Z‐sections loaded in direct compression. The Z‐sections varied in length from 18 in. (457 mm) to 96 in. (2,438 mm). An important parametric variation in these tests was the angle between the edge stiffeners and the flanges that varied from 0° to 80°. The results indicated good agreement between the ultimate capacity obtained through the current AISI specifications and the experimental results.

AB - Fatigue is an important design criterion for elastomeric bearings, but it is not well understood. This paper examines the design methods currently in use for controlling fatigue. Twenty‐six fatigue tests were performed to evaluate the design methods, and the results are described here. The bearings were tested in cyclic shear or compression. Fatigue cracks formed in the rubber near the steel reinforcement, and they sometimes grew to a significant depth. The important parameters affecting fatigue life are described. Rates of crack growth and location of cracking are presented, and they are correlated with load rate, mean loading, load range, and the material properties. A design method for improving fatigue behavior is then proposed.

AB - A dimensional analysis criterion is proposed to compute the minimum amount of reinforcement for high‐strength concrete members in flexure. Such an amount is assumed to be provided by the condition of simultaneous first cracking aand steel yielding. The fracture mechanics model utilized defines a brittleness number NP, which is revealed to be a measure of the experimental brittleness or ductility of the test. NP is a function of steel‐yield strength fy, concrete fracture toughness KIC, steel percentage AS/A, and beam depth. The brittleness of the structural member increases by increasing the size and/or decreasing the steel content. On the other hand, a physically similar behavior is revealed in the cases where the brittleness number NP is the same. The experimental investigation carried out by the writers shows that the failure mechanism changes completely when the beam depth is varied, the steel percentage being the same. Only when the steel percentage is inversely proportional to the square root of the beam depth is the mechanical behavior reproduced.

AB - This paper describes the frictional properties of sheet type Teflon‐steel interfaces in relation to their application in sliding bearings for base‐isolated building and bridge structures. A series of laboratory experiments has been conducted on Teflon‐steel interfaces to determine the effect of sliding velocity, sliding acceleration, bearing pressure, type of Teflon, and surface finish on the frictional chracteristics of sliding bearings. It is found that sliding acceleration has insignificant effects on the recorded values of frictional force. However, sliding velocity and bearing pressure have important effects. Friction increases with increasing velocity up to a certain value of velocity beyond which it remains constant. Furthermore, friction drops with increasing pressure with a rate of reduction that is strongly dependent on velocity. It stabilizes at a value of pressure between 5,000 and 6,500 psi (34.5and44.9N/mm2). Substantial differences between breakaway (or static) coefficient of friction and sliding (or kinetic) coefficient of friction are observed. In general, the breakaway value is two‐four times larger than the sliding value.

AB - A mathematical model of the factional behavior of Teflon sliding bearings for conditions of interest in base isolation is developed. The calibration of the model is based on extensive experimental data that were presented in an accompanying paper. The model is capable of accounting for: (1) Unidirectional and multidirectional motion at the Teflon‐steel interface; (2) velocity and pressure dependence of the coefficient of sliding friction; and (3) breakaway (or static) friction effects. The model is characterized by four parameters. These are the minimum and maximum values of the sliding coefficient of friction, the ratio of breakaway to sliding coefficient of friction at initiation of sliding and a parameter that describes the variation of the sliding coefficient of friction with velocity. Values of these parameters are presented for sixteen combinations of type of Teflon, bearing pressure and condition (surface roughness) of mating steel surface. Applications of the model in the analysis/design of a sliding isolation system are presented and the effects of bearing pressure and breakaway friction are evaluated. Furthermore, an assessment of the implications of using Coulomb's constant friction model rather than the developed model is presented.

AB - This paper deals with the static analysis of nonprismatic members of any arbitrary variation in its moment of inertia Ix and where their materia] is stressed beyond their elastic limit, thus causing the modulus of elasticity Ex to vary along their length. The stress and deflection characteristics of such members for both elastic and inelastic analysis will be determined by using the method of the equivalent systems (see Fertis 1956, 1964, 1973, 1984). This method permits the replacement of the original member of variable stiffness ExIx with one of uniform stiffness E1I1 whose elastic line is identical to that of the original variable stiffness member. An exact, as well as a very accurate approximate solution is obtained that drastically reduces the mathematical complexity of the problem. The member can be analyzed in both elastic and inelastic ranges to failure, thus permitting observation of progressive deterioration of the member's ability to resist load, stress, and deformation, and establishing useful, practical, critical limits regarding these quantities.

AB - A common cause of structural failure in flat roof systems is attributable to rainwater accumulating on the roofs as a result of the ponding phenomenon. This study investigates the structural reliability of timber roof beams that are subjected to ponding loads. An approximate ponding amplification factor is derived, and a simple design equation is proposed in the context of reliabilitybased design, which is suitable for implementation in a limit‐states design code. The reliability assessment of the bending strength limit state of sawn lumber and glued‐laminated roof beams is carred out using standard first‐order reliability methods. By adjusting the performance factor, which modifies the characteristic modulus of elasticity, the proposed design equation is calibrated for both types of timber beams. The objective of the calibration procedure is to ensure that a prescribed level of reliability is achieved with the proposed design equation.

AB - In the design of steel buildings, the allowable stress design (ASD) method has long been used for cold‐formed steel structural members in the United States. Recently, the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) criteria have been developed for steel buildings using hot‐rolled shapes and built‐up members fabricated from steel plates. In order to develop load and resistance factor design (LRFD) criteria for cold‐formed steel structural members, a joint research project is conducted at the University of Missouri‐Rolla, Washington University, and the University of Minnesota under the sponsorship of the American Iron and Steel Institute. Based on the 1986 edition of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) ASD specification, the LRFD specification for cold‐formed steel structural members with commentary is prepared for consideration of the American Iron and Steel Institute. The background information for developing the proposed design criteria for structural members is discussed in this paper.

AB - An assessment of the strength of an existing structural component or system is commonly made by determining the strength at selected sample points in the space of the structure. Samples may be obtained as cores or nondestructive test measurements. The number of sample points and their layout affect both the cost and the accuracy of testing. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the use of semivariogram analysis and kriging estimation in evaluating the strength of structural components. These methods provide the basis for establishing guidelines for developing a sampling program that balances the cost of data collection and accuracy requirements. Examples on the strength evaluation of columns and slabs are presented. The calculation of the relative error variances of both point and mean value estimates for the strength of columns and slabs is demonstrated. Guidelines for establishing testing programs are presented.

AB - The formula is derived for the depth of prestressed concrete beam as a function of live load moment, efficiency of prestressing, and allowable stresses in bottom fiber. Since the live load moment depends on beam span and load, the depth of beam becomes a function of span and load. Usually the bottom fiber stresses govern design, but in cases when stresses in top fiber are critical, the substitution of allowable stresses in the top fiber in place of allowable stresses in the bottom fiber makes presented formula valid in this case. The influence of other parameters, such as dead load moment, specific gravity of beam's material, section effectiveness, position of centroidal axis, span-to-depth ratio, and stockiness of the section is contained in factor J, which has the average value 2.85 and varies in the range of 2.40-3.30. The formula is applicable to beams fully prestressed and can be extended on partially prestressed beams, when limiting crack width or proper tensile stresses in bottom fiber are established. The cross sections of I or T beams as well as rectangular beams are covered by the derived formula.
