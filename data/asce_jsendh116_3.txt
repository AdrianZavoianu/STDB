AB - An analytical and experimental investigation of mode I (tensile) and mixed mode (combined tensile and shear) fracture of concrete subjected to impact loading was conducted. The rate of loading ranged from a slow strain rate of 10-6/s to an impact strain rate of 0.5/s. Mixed‐mode tests were conducted using beams with notches at different locations along the span of the beam. A new clip gage was developed to measure crack‐opening displacement at slow and impact rates of loading. A nonlinear fracture‐mechanics model was developed to predict the rate sensitivity of mode I and mixed‐mode fracture of concrete. This approach was based on the observation that the prepeak nonlinearity may be attributed to prepeak stable crack growth and that this prepeak crack growth decreased with an increase in the rate of loading. The mixed‐mode‐fracture‐mechanics study used finite element analysis with singular quarter‐point elements at the crack tip. Mixed‐mode experimental and analytical results indicate that impact loading could result in brittle diagonal tension‐shear failure of concrete structures as opposed to ductile flex‐ural failure at a slow rate of loading.

AB - It is customary in North America to evaluate a short‐span bridge on a busy highway exactly the same way as a bridge on a lightly travelled road. This paper proposes that multipresence reduction factors can be used as the means for taking account of volume of traffic. These factors, strictly speaking, are applicable only to bridges that carry a high volume of traffic; however, in bridge‐design codes such as AASHTO and OHBDC, they are used for all bridges irrespective of the volume of traffic. New multipresence‐reduction factors, to be used in conjunction with AASHTO, Ontario, and CSA codes, are proposed for different classes of highways. In addition, the paper presents simplified methods of transverse load distribution that incorporate the proposed reduction factors in such a way that the designer or evaluator can see immediately the effect of volume of traffic on live load responses without having to perform extra calculations.

AB - Flexural and shear strengths of reinforced masonry shear walls are examined, based on experimental results obtained from 22 6‐ft by 6‐ft masonry wall specimens. These results are summarized and current design formulas examined. It is found that the simple flexure theory based on the plane‐section assumption can be applied to square wall panels with good accuracy. Moreover, it appears to be consistently conservative. The 1988 Uniform Building Code specifications for the shear strength tend to be very conservative for the square wall panels studied and less conservative for walls with lower aspect ratios. Furthermore, the code specifications tend to overestimate the shear strength contributed by the horizontal reinforcement and neglect the influence of axial stress. Hence, a new shear formula that takes into account the influence of axial stress and flexural reinforcement is proposed. The formula appears to have good correlation with experimental results obtained in this study as well as those of others.

AB - The evaluation of structural loads due to drifted snow on a multilevel roof is considered. A detailed case history is presented that highlights the two types of drifts that form on multilevel roofs. The two types of snowdrift are triangular drifts, which typically form at backward‐facing steps, and quadrilateral drifts, which typically form at forward‐facing steps. Thirty‐five case histories of large triangular drifts on multilevel roofs are used in developing an empirical relation for predicting drift size. The empirical relationship is the result of multiple‐regression analysis involving pertinent roof‐geometry parameters as well as environmental factors. The environmental factors considered are snowfall, wind speed and wind direction. The combination of wind and snowfall is an attempt to characterize blizzard intensity. The writers feel that the empirical relationship presented herein is an improvement over previous relationships in that wind in general and blizzard intensity in particular are included in the model.

AB - An experimental and analytical investigation is conducted regarding the behavior of Ontario‐type reinforced concrete bridge decks. A full‐scale bridge deck (both cast‐in‐place and precast), detailed in accordance with the Texas State Department of Highways provisions for Ontario‐type decks, and having about 60% of the reinforcement required by the current AASHTO code, performs well under current AASHTO design load levels. Under service and overload conditions (about three times the current AASHTO design wheel load), the behavior of the deck slab is essentially linear. Membrane forces do not noticeably affect the performance of the bridge prior to deck cracking. After cracking, significant compressive membrane forces are present in the deck, and could significantly increase its flexural capacity. Detailed finite element models of the specimen are developed for both the cast‐in‐place and precast panel deck cases. Cracking of the deck is followed using sequential linear analyses with a smeared cracking model. Analytical predictions agree well with experimental results.

AB - Based on the limitations of present building code formulas for earthquake forces identified in an earlier paper, an improved procedure to estimate the earthquake forces for the initial, preliminary design of buildings is presented. Starting with the earthquake design spectrum for elastic or inelastic design and only the overall, general description of the proposed building, this procedure provides an indirect approach to estimate the response in the first two vibration modes of the building. The procedure recognizes the important influence of those building properties and parameters that significantly influence its earthquake response without requiring all the computations inherent in standard dynamic analysis by the response spectrum method. The procedure represents a major improvement over present building codes with little increase in computational effort.

AB - Tests are carried out on 32 reinforced concrete corbels subjected to vertical loading. Steel fibers are used as shear reinforcement in 26 corbels. The main parameters varied are the volumes of main bars and fibrous reinforcements, and the shear‐span‐to‐depth ratio. The results indicated considerable improvement in ductility and strength of corbels as the fiber content was increased. In some instances, it was possible to change the mode of failure from being diagonal splitting or shear to flexure. An empirical equation is presented for estimating the shear strength of corbels based on results reported in this paper and elsewhere. Comparison between the experimental and calculated shear strengths of all corbels tested shows that the two values obtained in each case are in satisfactory agreement.

AB - An exact general closed‐form approach to estimation of fatigue reliability of parallel systems, which represent a set of failure paths of structural systems, is presented. The parallel system considered here is completely general and comprises components that are of different strength and share unequal loads. The system failure is regarded as the sequential failure of its members. A general expression for the notional probability of fatigue failure of this system is developed using Wirsching's model of fatigue failure of the system nodes and by relating the compressed times to failure of nonfailed nodes following failure of some of the nodes in the system to their nominal times to failure corresponding to the state when all system members are intact. The general expression is first validated by comparison to a known parallel system in which system members are of equal strength and share equal loads, and then employed to estimate the failure probability of another system in which the system components are of unequal strength.

AB - Finite‐element formulations are presented for the analysis of reinforced concrete membrane structures. Cracked reinforced concrete is treated as an orthotropic material based on a smeared, rotating crack model. Secant‐stiffness moduli are defined for concrete and reinforcement, and these are used in the development of linear displacement rectangular and triangular membrane finite elements. Procedures are discussed by which these elements can then be incorporated into a nonlinear analysis algorithm. Extensions to the formulations are also described that permit the consideration of prestrain effects in the component materials such as prestressing of the reinforcement, shrinkage of the concrete, or thermal expansion. The constitutive relations currently utilized are those of the modified compression field theory, although the element formulations are sufficiently generic to easily accommodate other constitutive models. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the simplicity of the calculation procedure and the good convergence characteristics and numerical stability of the formulations. Corroboration with experimental data is also discussed. Finally, the capabilities and application potential of the analysis procedure are demonstrated in sample analyses.

AB - Results of tests on a large number of beam‐column subassemblies performed by the writers and others are examined. After reviewing the existing techniques, an index is proposed that can quantify the energy absorption and dissipation characteristics of a reinforced concrete frame. Based on this index, a simple design chart is presented for selection of the required area of confining steel for the joint region of R.C. frames so that ductile behavior can be achieved. The confining steel is a function of the joint shear stress and the ratio of the flexural capacities of the columns to that of the beam at the joint. The numerical examples included demonstrate that for the extreme case, the required area of steel obtained from the design chart is comparable to the current ACI‐ASCE Committee 352 recommendations. However, for many other cases, the design chart permits a relaxation of the area of confining steel required. This results in greater ease and economy of construction.

AB - An analytical formulation for modeling the tension‐stiffness phenomenon in cracked reinforced concrete bars is presented. It is assumed that the bond stress‐slip relationship is bilinear, and remains linear throughout the bar in the initial stages of the cracking. At the later stages, the bond stress becomes constant. Unlike in the reinforced concrete models currently in use, it is shown that the tension‐stiffness phenomenon is a function of the parameters of the problem, viz., the area parameter, the bond parameter, and the strength parameter. A simplified model is also presented in which the bond parameter is eliminated. Results from the present model are compared with those from some test results. Various implications related to the assumptions and the conclusions are reviewed. The experimental results show a marked reduction in the tensile capacity of concrete at higher deformations that cannot be explained by the proposed relationships. A possible solution is to use a variable concrete tensile strength that diminishes exponentially as a function of the average tensile strain and a damage parameter. Future investigations may show that this parameter is related to the property of the materials, geometry of the structural member, the loading level, and so on. The present formulation represents a significant improvement over the models currently in use.

AB - This study deals with the mathematical and experimental determination of contact pressure distribution between bridge decks and truck tires. The variables associated with this study are tire inflation pressure, axle loads, treaded or bald tire, and main bar spacing and its orientation with traffic flow. A classical structural mechanics approach for contact pressure distribution has been developed by idealizing the open steel grid deck and the tire as two different springs in series. In addition, an approximate, but simplified, distribution procedure has been developed. Synthesis of our test data reveals the following trends: (1) Increase in inflation pressure increases the peak values of the contact pressure distribution profile; (2) maximum contact pressure is found to be about 2.5 times the average pressure computed from the current AASHTO specifications for highway bridges; (3)rate of increase in contact pressure is not as rapid as the increase in axle loads; (4)fully treaded tires are found to result in higher contact pressures than the bald tires; and (5) load carried by main bars is higher when they are placed perpendicular to, rather than parallel to the traffic flow.

AB - An analysis is described that models the behavior of planar prestressed concrete cable‐stayed bridges up to failure taking into account geometric and material nonlinearities. The geometric nonlinearities arise from cable sag, large deformations of the system, and from the shift of the centroid of the deck section caused by the material or by cracking of the concrete. The effect of the axial forces on the stiffness of the members is also considered. Material nonlinearities are encountered when one or more of the structure components, namely the stay cables, prestressing tendons, the reinforcement, or the concrete, exceed their elastic limits. Parametric studies are made on cable‐stayed bridges with the following cable arrangements: fan, semifan and harp‐type cable arrangement. To demonstrate the influence of the different types of nonlinearity on the internal forces and reactions three analyses were performed—namely elastic, geometric nonlinear, and geometric and material nonlinear analyses—and the results are compared.

AB - This paper extends Keller's classic solution for the optimal design of columns to the case of plates. After the introduction of nondimensional variables, a calculus of variations technique is used to derive an optimality condition, which states that “the strain‐energy density is proportional to the thickness of an optimal plate design.” The case of a simply supported plate is then discussed, using a truncated Fourier series solution. For a square, isotropic plate, the buckling load of the optimal design is larger than that of the uniform plate by a factor of 1.71+1.37ν (ν is Poisson's ratio). An appendix is included which discusses Keller's original solution and shows how it can be applied when a fourth‐order differential equation is used rather than the second‐order one used by Keller. This appendix also discusses the use of a truncated Fourier series and Rayleigh's method as an approximation of Keller's result, thus laying the groundwork for the use of Fourier series in the plate problem.

AB - A computer program is developed for ultimate strength design of concrete box sections subjected to biaxial bending and axial load. The distribution of steel reinforcement is assumed to be symmetric in the section. In the analysis the equilibrium equations are expressed in terms of the three unknowns describing the location of the modified axis and the total reinforcement area within the cross section, which leads to three simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations that are solved by a procedure based on the Newton-Raphson method. It is observed that the iterative algorithm used in the program converges rapidly for many different problem tested, and execution time of the program is small; hence the program can be run many times with different reinforcement arrangements and the most suitable reinforcement pattern among them can be chosen.
