AB - This paper describes further field measurements of the impact fraction, I, for Six Mile Creek Bridge, an 11.28‐m‐span composite steel and concrete grider bridge. It reports values between -0.19and1.25, consistent with those found previously. It also uses bridge strains to determine records of dynamic axle loads versus time for a standard truck and 123 service vehicles, and subjects them to Fourier analysis. Although there is a relationship between impact and the magnitude of the dynamic load components, this relationship is complex. There is no simple method to identify impactive vehicles. The field data has also been used to calibrate a simple vehicle model proposed in a companion paper, in which each axle load includes a dynamic load component that varies sinusoidally at the natural frequency of the bridge. This model has been used to predict upper bound values of I for bridges of varying span, with this dynamic component set at 4, 6, and 10%. The resulting values are larger than those that have been commonly used, particularly for shorter spans.

AB - This paper suggests a simple vehicle model that may be used to estimate impact in highway bridges. In this model each axle load consists of a constant load together with a sinusoidally varying dynamic component with a frequency equal to the natural frequency of the bridge. For maximum impact the dynamic load components must be in phase with respect to time. Maximum bending moments in a simple girder are determined by the span, the static axle loads, the relative magnitude of the dynamic load component, and a bridge factor defined as the number of dynamic load maxima applied by an axle during its passage over the bridge. It is shown that for many bridges, the first natural frequency is simply related to the span and that the bridge factor is about 6. Impact values are predicted for a range of spans with a dynamic load component equal to 10% of the static load. A companion paper uses field studies to review this percentage.

AB - The aim of the work described in this paper is to provide an improved interaction equation for the design of braced‐steel, cylindrical tubular beam columns. It is found that the current American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) linear interaction equations generally give a very conservative result for cylindrical tubular members, especially for shorter members and members bent in double curvature, because these equations were developed and refined on the basis of the test results and the exact analyses of wide‐flange members. In this paper, a unified design interaction equation for wide‐flange members under uniaxial bending recently proposed by the writers is extended to the design of cylindrical tubular beam columns. The effects of local buckling and external hydrostatic pressure on the strength of these members are also considered. Extensive evaluations of the proposed equation have been made by comparing with the results of exact inelastic solutions and more than 100 full‐scale tubular column tests, providing final confirmation of the validity of the proposed equation.

AB - The moment‐rotation relationships of semirigid steel beam‐to‐column connections including single and double web‐angle connections and top‐ and seat‐angle connections with or without double web angle, are developed. The initial elastic stiffness and ultimate moment capacity of the connections are determined by a simple analytical procedure. The shape parameter is then determined by a least‐square curve fitting with experimental tests in Purdue University's data bank. Using the initial connection stiffness, ultimate moment capacity, and shape parameter so obtained, a three‐parameter power model adequate for representing the moment‐rotation relationships of these connections. The power model is simple to use and provides a realistical representation of the actual moment‐rotation behavior of each connection type with angles, and can be easily implemented in a second‐order frame analysis.

AB - The effect of nonproportionally fluctuating axial load on the inelastic cyclic behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) columns is investigated. For this purpose, a uniaxial flexural model is developed where columns are represented with an assemblage of plane‐stress and bar elements to model the concrete and the reinforcing steel, respectively. The results indicate that under uncoupled variations in axial and lateral forces, the hysteresis curve is not of the Masing type. Furthermore, the shear force versus lateral displacement relationships demonstrate “negative energy” regions. The cause of such a phenomenon is explained in light of axial deformations. It is also shown that the phasing of the axial force has a significant effect on the response. Those properties of RC columns that are affected by this type of loading are important factors in the seismic design of RC structures. The importance of varying vertical loads on the response of bridges is demonstrated through two practical examples.

AB - For the first time the generalized boundary conditions are formulated and recommended for the large‐deflected and sagging axisymmetric membranes supported by circular linearly elastic rings at the contours. The similitude theory is used to define the optimal structure for nondimensional variables and parameters of membranes. As a result, the new nondimensional differential equations and boundary conditions are derived and recommended for nonlinear analyses of flat and sagging membranes. These equations allow the reduction of numerical analyses to just a single load case for the spectrum of possible loadings. The “shooting” method is successfully used for analyses of flat and sagging axisymmetric membranes. The new interpolation procedure recommended for the shooting procedure is the square parabola method of interpolation, which much more effective than existing methods. The “shooting” method is compared to exact solutions for flat and sagging membranes. For practical purposes, flat axisymmetric membranes with rigid central circular plates of different radii r0 are analyzed for different loadings. The results are presented and can be used for design.

AB - This paper investigates the elastic flexural‐torsional buckling of I‐beams supported (suspended) symmetrically by cables or chains, as might be encountered in practice in a lifting operation. The governing differential equations of minor axis flexure and torsion are derived for suspended I‐beams subject to symmetrical concentrated loads and/or uniformly distributed load. The boundary conditions corresonding to symmetrical and antisymmetrical buckling mode shapes are fully examined. Parameters influencing the buckling behavior of suspended I‐beams are identified. The solution procedure using the finite integral method is briefly described. Theoretical predictions of elastic buckling loads compare very well to results from a series of small‐scale aluminium I‐beam experiments. A theoretical study to illustrate the influence of some of the many variables affecting the buckling behavior of suspended beams is presented.

AB - Based on the energy principle, the tapered elements for beam‐columns are derived and incorporated into a user‐friendly nonlinear frame analysis computer program. When compared to the methods using the conventional uniform elements or the numerical integration technique, the present approach is more accurate and/or efficient for the nonlinear analysis of tapering structures. Numerical examples demonstrating the performance of the derived tapered elements and the uses of the elements in the large deflection and snap‐through analysis of structures comprising tapered members are given. It was found that, although a tapered member may have a higher member buckling load than its uniform counterpart of same weight of material, its uses in the construction of space frames may reduce considerably the global snap‐through load of the structure, leading to a potential danger of earlier structural collapse.

AB - Elevated light‐gauge silos usually have a conical discharge hopper at the bottom. Although this hopper often carries much of the total weight of the stored solids within the silo, it can often be cold‐formed from thin steel sheet because the structural form is very efficient. However, guidance on the design of light‐gauge hopper structures is rare. The term light‐gauge is used here to describe the class of cold‐formed silo structure that is not restricted by a nominal minimum plate thickness requirement (e.g., 1/4 in. or 6 mm). This paper addresses several aspects of the design of light‐gauge hoppers. Current proposals concerning hopper loads are discussed first, and recommendations are made. Appropriate structural analysis is then presented. The potential failure modes of the hopper are identified, and corresponding strength checks described.

AB - Prestressed lattice structures are structures in which certain components are pretensioned in order to improve the performance of the structure. Prestressing the diagonals of lattice frames can increase the lateral stiffness and load‐carrying capacity by increasing the rotational restraint at the joints. Thus, the objective of this research was to determine the effect of prestressing the diagonals on the buckling load of lattice frames with intersecting and offset diagonals. A total of seven tests were conducted on two‐dimensional, single‐bay, three‐story frames with nonprestressed and prestressed diagonals and with intersecting and offset diagonals. A theoretical study of the frames was also conducted. It was found that prestressing the diagonals in frames with intersecting diagonals did not increase the load‐carrying capacity. Offsetting the diagonals on the crossarm or on the verticals increased the load‐carrying capacity over that obtained for similar frames that were not prestressed.

AB - Previous research on the prestressing of lattice frames dealt with relatively short two‐ and three‐dimensional frames. It was found that prestressing the diagonals in frames with intersecting diagonals did not increase the load‐carrying capacity. Offsetting the diagonals on the crossarm or on the verticals, and prestressing these offset diagonals, increased the load‐carrying capacity. It was felt that in a slender structure the effects of prestressing would be even more pronounced. As a result, it was decided to undertake a study of a slender prestressed lattice frame. The failure mode of this frame, one of Euler‐type buckling, is different from that observed in the short frames, which is essentially one of buckling of the verticals between the panel points. A 23‐story slender lattice frame, prestressed and nonprestressed, with axial load and then with axial and lateral load, was studied experimentally and theoretically. It was found that prestressing the diagonals is beneficial in increasing the load‐carrying capacity and reducing lateral deflection.

AB - Cylindrical bins, silos, and tanks are thin shell structures subject to internal pressure from stored materials together with axial compression from the frictional drag of stored materials on the walls and roof loads. The governing failure mode is frequently buckling under axial compression. The internal pressure can significantly enhance the buckling strength, but high internal pressures lead to severe local bending near the base. Local yielding then precipitates a buckling failure. This failure mode, often known as “elephant's foot” buckling, has received very little attention to date and is commonly ignored in tank and silo design. This paper describes the results of a study of the elastic‐plastic instability and collapse of axially loaded internally pressurized perfect thin cylindrical shells adjacent to the support. The results are compared with previous design recommendations and a new simple equation is proposed for use in design.

AB - Load‐displacement characteristics and failure modes of metal‐plate‐connected wood truss joints are presented. Tension splice, heel, and web at the bottom chord joints are fabricated using southern pine (SP) no. 2 lumber and 20‐gage punched metal plates. These joints are tested with a newly developed testing appratus that allows the testing of all three joints without major modifications. In‐plane loads are applied to simulate the loads carried by truss members. The computerized testing apparatus and methods show potential as an efficient testing procedure to assess joint behavior. The average strength of tension splice, heel, and web at the lower chord joints is 27.0 kN, 22.7 kN, and 16.7 kN, respectively. The failure of the heel joint is characterized as ductile, and that of the tension splice and web at the bottom chord joints as brittle. The failure of the joints is a combination of wood and teeth failure. The results are useful for semirigid joint analysis and design of metal‐plate‐connected wood trusses.

AB - Although bell‐and‐spigot joints have been used successfully for many years in the construction of large‐diameter water‐pipe mains, questions sometimes arise concerning the efficiency of the joints under axial (longitudinal) forces. In this paper, a simple general‐yielding approach is used to develop an equation that can be used to directly determine the strength of such joints. The calculated joint efficiency, which depends on the ratio of the joint eccentricity to the pipe‐wall thickness, ranges from 0.41 for a zero gap to 0.24 for a gap equal to the pipe thickness. The equation is reasonable and conservative when compared to finite‐element results, to the ASME code, and to test results. Also, tests show that a single full‐thickness fillet weld can provide adequate strength. Such joints should be used wherever possible because they are much more economical than butt joints.

AB - This paper presents a probabilistic damage analysis method to generate seismic fragility curves of structures. Uncertainties in earthquake and structure are quantified by evaluating uncertainties in parameters that define the earthquake‐structure system. The uncertainty in each parameter is characterized by several representative values that are selected considering the uncertainty range of the parameter and its use in engineering practices. Samples of structures and earthquake motions are constructed from the combination of these representative values, then the Latin hypercube sampling technique is used to construct the samples of earthquake‐structure system. For each sample, the nonlinear seismic analysis is performed to produce response data, which are then statistically analyzed. On the other hand, five limit states representing various degrees of structural damage are defined and the statistics of the structural capacity corresponding to each limit state can be established. The fragility curve is generated by evaluating the limit state probabilities at different levels of peak ground acceleration. For illustration, the fragility curves of a five‐story shear wall building are constructed.

AB - Modal stiffness and damping are determined from experimental test data for a single‐span laboratory bridge model and a full‐scale three‐span highway bridge. Steady‐state vibration tests are conducted on both structures using an electro‐hydraulic actuator. Accelerations are recorded at selected locations on the structures. For the laboratory model, the modal properties are calculated from experimental data for the as‐built model and after one flange is cut. Modal properties for the highway bridge are determined during a 40,000‐cycle fatigue test of the in situ structure. Changes in stiffness and mode shapes are related to the observed deterioration of the structures. Mode shapes are the best indicators of the deterioration.

AB - A method based on a multi‐layered ring model of prestressed concrete pipe is presented for analysis of such pipe under the combined effects of internal fluid pressure, external load, and pipe and fluid weights. This method considers the nonlinear properties of the concrete core, mortar coating, prestressing steel wire, and steel cylinder. In particular, it accounts for tensile strain softening and cracking of core concrete and coating mortar, and the redistribution of moment that results from the changes of stiffness around the pipe. The combined loads corresponding to certain serviceability, elastic, and strength limit states are calculated. The calculated combined loads at the onset of visible core and coating cracks are compared to the results of tests conducted on six embedded‐ and lined‐cylinder pipes. The comparison shows good agreement. Significant moment redistribution from invert and crown to springline is shown to occur at combined loads that result in softening of core concrete at the invert and crown of the pipe.

AB - A modified form of the equation developed by Basler to predict the shear strength of plate girders is derived for the case of a plate girder panel with a concentric, unreinforced rectangular web opening. For the beam action contribution a modified form of the classical plate buckling equation is adopted to account for the web opening, and the Basler approach is used for the inelastic range. The Basler approach is also adopted for the tension field action contribution in that the contribution of the flanges is neglected, and the tension field is assumed to intersect the corners of the panel that lie on the tension diagonal. Although Basler's theory is the basis for current U.S. plate girder specifications, the modified theory developed in this paper grossly underestimates the strength of model test girders; therefore an alternate theory developed by Narayanan and Der-Avanessian is recommended for the design of plate girders with web openings.

AB - The Lanczos algorithm is applied to the eigenvalue problems of elastic stability, wherein the geometric stiffness matrix is used to describe the effect of the stress resultants. This matrix need not be positive or positive definite for a general structural system. Despite this fact, it is found that a simple algorithm, without the use of sophisticated convergence criteria and its concomitant programming, can be employed in stability computations. Even though the procedure exhibits an unusual convergence pattern, it can solve for the important buckling loads without the use of any a priori assumptions concerning the eigenvalues or eigenvectors. The simple algorithm can also be applied to dynamic eigenvalue problems but, as the example considered herein demonstrates, it may not be efficient in computing all required eigenvalues for a given frequency range.

AB - A method for predicting the punching strength of symmetric slab-column connections in flat slab structures is presented. The rational simplified model used was derived from a more complete one previously proposed by the author. This model leads to a single equation, which is mostly required for design, agrees with the observed slab behavior, and correlates well with test results.
