AB - This paper clarifies experimentally the lateral buckling behavior of I beams stiffened with web stiffeners or batten plates. The beams are simply supported and subjected to uniform bending. The lateral displacements of I beams stiffened with web stiffeners and batten plates decrease from before lateral buckling and do not increase suddenly in the neighborhood of lateral buckling. A new method based on the fourth power of lateral displacements is proposed in order to reflect sufficiently the slow variation of lateral displacements occurring in the neighborhood of lateral buckling for such a stiffened beam. The critical moments determined from experimental data by using the proposed method are compared with the critical moments obtained by using Southwell plots, Massey plot, modified plots by Trahair, and the Meck method. Last, to improve the writer's previous theory for I beams stiffened with web stiffeners and/or batten plates, the effective length coefficient is presented by comparing the theoretical results with experimental results.

AB - Loads due to extraordinary events are investigated using data from the Sydney live‐load survey. A total of 1,989 extraordinary events of normal crowding, emergency crowding, and furniture stacking are studied. Parameters for a multiple extraordinary load model are obtained from the actual survey data. It is observed that not just the number of extraordinary load cells but all other parameters are area dependent. The mean and standard deviation of the number of people in a crowd for both normal crowding and emergency crowding decrease with decreasing floor area. Load due to furniture stacking shows a similar trend of variation. The numbers of load cells for the three types of extraordinary events are also observed to be different. Data from the present survey are compared with those from previous surveys. Present parameters are compared with values assumed by previous investigators. Extraordinary loads are predicted by using the extraordinary load model with the present parameters. They are observed to be, in general, 30% larger than values obtained using parameters assumed by previous workers.

AB - A method of constructing a planar model for the analysis of relatively complex three‐dimensional tall‐building structural systems is proposed. The buildings may be asymmetric in plan, and composed of orthogonal intersecting bents of any type. Bent properties and configurations may vary throughout the height. No transformations of bent properties or analysis results are required. The model consists of all the bents, from both orthogonal directions, assembled in a single plane and joined by a mechanism in the plane. The mechanism causes the response of the bents in the single plane to duplicate their relative response in the three‐dimensional structure.

AB - An effective method of computerized analysis of linear elastic cylindrical storage tanks under various axisymmetric support and statical loading conditions is outlined. It applies to tanks resting on unyielding circular line supports and/or elastic media represented by either Winkler springs or an elastic half‐space; linear elastic vertical constraints also being admissible. For tanks buried in soil, the Winkler‐type soil structure interaction is employed. Both open‐topped tanks and structures covered with monolithically joined disc or ring plates are dealt with. The method of analysis applied is a force‐type approach in which each of the main elements, i.e., the base plate, wall, and cover plate (if present) is at first considered separately and then the global solution is obtained by making use of the displacement compatability conditions at the plate‐wall junctions. As demonstrated by the examples, the main features of the method are: (1) High accuracy of the results; (2) very low computational cost; (3) large applicability range; and (4) easy use in the design work.

AB - The reliability of a short reinforced concrete (RC) column subject to various loads is assessed. The loads yield a two‐dimensional stress, axial force N and bending moment M. Methods for solving such kind of problems are reviewed: Monte Carlo simulation is proved to be suitable. With reference to the lower‐end section of the column, the point NS, MS in the plane N, M represents the stress: the minimum distance of this point from the boundary of the resisting domain of the section is assumed as a reliability measure. Using Monte Carlo simulation, large samples are constructed for the minimum distance. The resisting domain and the point NS, MS are random quantities; the latter depends on the applied loads, that are dead, snow, and wind load. Snow and wind loads are stochastic processes and are schematized as filtered Poisson processes. Examining the samples, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the distance is found by statistical methods. The value of the CDF in zero gives the probability of failure (Pf). Pf is about 10-6.

AB - This paper has studied the applicability of base isolation to structures. The Navy is evaluating the potential use of base isolation for essential structures that must remain functional in a postearthquake environment. The paper reviews preliminary building‐selection criteria and structural design criteria. For low‐rise regular‐frame construction situated on a rock or stiff site and housing‐sensitive equipment, base isolation of the columns offers the potential for significant damage reduction. The paper presents a comparison of analysis techniques treating the isolator as a nonlinear hysteretic element and as linear elements with and without nodal damping. The results indicate that for the case studied, significant differences in displacement and drift result while moments vary by about 10%. Vertical acceleration effects were found to cause an increase in maximum moment by about 15%.

AB - Results of an experimental study are presented that help illustrate the effectiveness of using base isolators for reducing the lateral‐force demand for engineered masonry building structures in areas of high seismicity. Two structures of identical configuration were each subjected to a similar series of three base motions that increased progressively in intensity. One structure was fixed to the platform of an earthquake simulator while the other was mounted on a set of four isolator pads that were attached to the simulator platform. Test structures were constructed at one‐quarter scale using model concrete blocks and annealed wire for reinforcement. Measured accelerations of the isolated structure were notably less than that of the fixed‐base structure for the same input motion. By isolating the structure, essentially no cracking occurred even for a base motion that caused significant cracking and yielding of reinforcement for the fixed‐base structure. Measured response correlated well with estimates computed on the bases of newly proposed Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC) design requirements for base isolated structures.

The principal modes of initial imperfections are taken into account in analysis. Comparison between the results of the prevailing specifications and the theory of this paper is presented. Errors of the specifications are checked. Equations for calculating the ultimate strength of centrically loaded and bending stiffened plates and thin‐walled square box sections are proposed based on the theoretical results. A simple interaction equation is presented for calculating the ultimate strength of eccentrically loaded sections. And, finally, effective design methods for axially and eccentrically loaded columns are suggested. The results of the suggested methods are in good agreement with those of the finite‐element method.

AB - The Deer Islc‐Sedgwick Suspension Bridge in Maine, constructed around the same time as the old Tacoma Narrows Bridge, has a history of objectionable wind‐induced response. This bridge has been the subject of an extensive field survey by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration for the last several years. The Deer Isle bridge, by virtue of this availability of field data, was a field experiment in a comprehensive study aimed at corroborating and sharpening the wind response computation of these flexible long‐span bridges. The study helped recognize the “signature” or “self‐induced” turbulence as one of the important, if not the primary, mechanisms behind buffeting‐type response. The present paper discusses the types of field wind‐driven motions observed, and, both experimental and analytical investigations centered around the wind response prediction of long‐span bridges accounting for the effects of this signature turbulence.

AB - A data base is developed for examining the behavior of steel beam columns. This data base, made in the format of a relational data base, contains the results of 237 tests carried out previously in Japan. By using the data base, the strength characteristics of steel beam columns are investigated statistically, and the following observations are made. The experimental strength is 16% larger on the average than the strength predicted by the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) specification with the coefficient of variation as 0.10. Variation in the yield stress, with respect to the nominal yield stress, makes the experimental strength larger than the predicted strength by 7% but does not change the coefficient of variation. The experimental strength is 40% larger on the average than the design strength stipulated in the LRFD specification. The experimental strength is larger by 10–15% for beam columns with steep moment gradient than for those with uniform moment, and also for beam columns whose yield ratio is below 0.7 than for those with a larger yield ratio. The aforementioned observation demonstrates that the effect of strain hardening on the strength of beam columns is conspicuous.

AB - Because of their complex behavior under wind, earthquake, and moving loads, the dynamic response of cable‐stayed bridges requires special studies. Use of experimental procedures to confirm design assumptions and predict their structural performance is well known. A monitoring program was initiated in order to determine the present dynamic properties of the Tampico bridge as well as changes in structural characteristics during its lifetime of service. Results from ambient vibration and pull‐back tests are presented. The structure and the experimental setup is described. The data recorded during the testing program are analyzed in detail in order to determine the structural dynamic properties of the structure. Fundamental periods and mode shapes were calculated. Damping characteristics were obtained with different approaches developed by other authors and compared to those obtained for a similar structure. The results are useful for the dynamic analysis of new cable‐stayed bridges and to detect design failures in existing structures of this type.

AB - The static strength of reinforced concrete beams strengthened by gluing glass‐fiber‐reinforced‐plastic (GFRP) plates to their tension flanges is experimentally investigated. Five rectangular beams and one T‐beam were tested to failure under four‐point bending. The measured load versus strain in GFRP plate, steel rebar, extreme compression fiber of concrete, and the load versus deflection for the section at midspan of the beams are plotted and compared to the predicted values. The results indicate that the flexural strength of RC beams can be significantly increased by gluing GFRP plates to the tension face. In addition, the epoxy bonded plates improved the cracking behavior of the beams by delaying the formation of visible cracks and reducing crack widths at higher load levels.

AB - Analytical models based on the compatibility of deformations and equilibrium of forces are presented to predict the stresses and deformations in concrete beams strengthened with fiber composite plates epoxy‐bonded to the tension face of the beams. The models are given for beams having rectangular and T cross sections. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of design variables such as plate area, plate stiffness and strength, concrete compressive strength, and steel reinforcement ratio. The moment versus curvature diagrams for various combinations of these variables are plotted and compared. The results indicate that bonding composite plate to a concrete beam can increase the stiffness, yield moment, and flexural strength of the beam. The method is particularly effective for beams with a relatively low steel reinforcement ratio.

AB - The dynamic behavior of three‐dimensional (3‐D) long‐span cable‐stayed bridges under seismic loadings is studied. The cases of synchronous and nonsynchronous support motions due to seismic excitations of these flexible structures are considered; furthermore, effects of the nondispersive traveling seismic wave on the bridge response are studied. Different sources of nonlinearity for such bridges are included in the analysis. Nonlinearities can be due to: (1) Changes of geometry of the whole bridge due to its large deformations, including changes in the geometry of the cables due to tension changes (known as the sag effect); and (2) axial force and bending moment interaction in the bridge tower as well as the girder elements. A tangent stiffness iterative procedure is used in the analysis to capture the nonlinear seismic response. Numerical examples are presented in which a comparison is made between a linear earthquake‐response analysis (based on the utilization of the tangent stiffness matrix of the bridge at the dead‐load deformed state) and a nonlinear earthquake‐response analysis using the step‐by‐step integration procedure. In these examples, two models having center (or effective) spans of 1,100 ft (335.5 m) and of 2,200 ft (671 m) are studied; this range covers both present and future designs. The study sheds some light on the salient features of the seismic analysis and design of these long contemporary bridges.

AB - A compact design equation is presented for the design of multiple fastener connections of wood members. It was obtained by algebraic simplification of the Lantos analysis of the unequal load sharing among fasteners in series. This equation can replace the double‐entry tables now used in wood design codes. Those tables are constructed using the Lantos analysis and for simplicity have to ignore certain effects and cover only a limited range of design parameters. In addition to the specification equation, two design aids are derived: (1) A simple expression for the maximum possible capacity of a serial row of fasteners; and (2) an expression for the number of fasteners required to achieve a given row capacity.

AB - Results of an experimental investigation of the lateral load behavior of antifriction slide bearings used in bridge foundations are presented. The tests are performed under quasi‐static lateral loads, and are intended to provide estimates for the average coefficient of friction of the bearings when they are subjected to slow rates of lateral movement, such as those occurring in bridge foundations due to support settlement, thermal expansion, and creep effects. During the experiments, the bearings are subjected to a constant vertical load simulating the weight of the assumed superstructure, while the lateral load is increased at a constant rate. The lateral load resistance of the bearings is found to be in excess of 5% of the applied confining pressure. Furthermore, the resistance increased with the rate of applied loads, but it was drastically reduced with increasing accumulated damage of the bearings (velocity and history‐dependent friction mechanism).

AB - A nonlinear curved‐beam finite element is developed for three‐dimensional space systems by using the principle of potential energy and polynomial functions. It is limited to elastic material with linear stress‐strain relation. Warping is not considered. A major improvement in the accuracy of the element is obtained by averaging the nonlinear part of the axial strain. The method of solution used is that of the fixed Lagrange coordinates and the Newton‐Raphson procedure. Comparisons of numerical results with those of various other methods indicate that, in terms of the number of elements or degrees of freedom needed for convergence, the method seems significantly more effective than most. None of the others was seen to be more effective. The problems considered included shallow and deep arches, extremely thin arches, and arches of various profiles. An application to an arch structure subjected to dynamic or cyclic (earthquake) loading is also illustrated.

AB - An active bracing system has been designed and fabricated for implementation to a full‐scale dedicated test structure for structural response control under seismic loads. Presented in this paper, the first part of a two‐part series, are the design of the active system, control algorithm development, and simulated control results under design earthquakes. Detailed design and analysis of the active system are carried out with respect to hardware development, control force constraints, and power and energy requirements. It is shown that a full‐scale efficient active structural control system can be developed within limits of current technology. Simulation results provide information on performance bounds that can be expected of active systems in structural control under seismic loads and under constraints imposed by practical considerations. The installation and observed performance of the system under actual ground motions will be the subject of the second paper in this series.

AB - This paper gives one simple set of equations for the determination of the equivalent loads of prestressing, which not only apply to all possible cases but are also easier to use than existing formulas. They can be used for interior spans, exterior spans, simple spans, and cantilever spans, as well as many other cases. These equations allow for the direct analysis of the effects of prestressing in a plane frame computer program. Since virtually all practicing structural engineers have access to a plane frame program and only need some general way of applying prestressing into the program, they will find these equations extremely useful. An example problem is included. These equations also facilitate the determination of both the vertical component of prestress used in shear calculations and friction losses due to the curvature of the tendon.

AB - The problem of negative shear lag in a cantilever beam subjected to a uniform load is explained in nonmathematical terms. In essence, the problem is one of two components (uniform-load component and concentrated reaction component), each of which is subjected to positive shear lag, being combined such that negative shear lag is produced. The key ingredient for negative shear lag is that the predominant component dampen faster than the less predominant component. This explanation is confirmed by using the folded-plate method to study an example problem.
