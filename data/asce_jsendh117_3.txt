AB - The limit analysis of circular cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure is formulated as a mathematical programming problem using the static theorem of plasticity. The governing differential equilibrium equations and force boundary conditions are linearized through a finite difference scheme. This discretization is combined with a piecewise linearization of the nonlinear yield curve to convert the formulation into a conventional linear programming exercise. This approach is shown to be superior to the more commonly used analytical techniques. In particular, it is general, systematic, and does not require prior knowledge of the stress field or collapse mechanism. In spite of the fact that a lower‐bound solution is not guaranteed due to possible yield violation at unchecked points in the structure, very accurate solutions can be obtained by suitably refining the finite difference mesh and, if necessary, the yield polygon. Examples of reported cases are solved to illustrate ease of application of the method, its flexibility, and accuracy.

AB - A practical method for the analysis and design of reinforced‐concrete columns under uniaxial/biaxial loads is presented. In this iterative method, the section strength is evaluated based on a known neutral axis and/or assumed steel ratio. Variation of the neutral axis parameters and steel ratio, as well as central difference method, made it possible for the calculation of the partial derivatives required in the multivariable nonlinear Newton's method. The solution scheme is suitable for computer application. Several examples, including analysis and design of columns under uniaxial tendings, biaxial tendings, or sections of unusual shapes, are also presented in this paper. In all the cases, starting from an arbitrarily given neutral axis position and steel ratio, convergence is attained in only severe iterations.

AB - The structural behavior of reinforced concrete coupled shear wall structures is greatly influenced by the behavior of their coupling beams. Flexure and shear are the two main modes of failure of reinforced concrete coupling beams. The behavior of coupling beams in the shear mode of failure, known as diagonal splitting, is represented by a mathematical model, and a method for the ultimate strength analysis is presented. The proposed method of analysis for RC coupling beams is used to verify the results of nine beams tested by a previous investigator.

A method is proposed to predict the mode of failure and the ultimate strength of coupled shear wall structures. The method is based on the evaluation of the strengths of the coupling beams and the walls at failure. Two lateral load cases have been considered: a point load at the top and a four‐point equivalent triangular distribution. The proposed analysis and the test results are compared.

AB - Tests on 135 battened composite specimens are performed to investigate the bond between concrete and steel in battened composite columns. Several factors believed to affect the bond between the two materials are investigated, including age and size of specimen, curing, and temperature. The test results of this investigation show that the battened composite section offered less bond strength than the concrete‐filled tubes tested elsewhere. Experimental evidence also shows that age of concrete is a major factor of bond reduction. The strength of bond at the age of one year is about 30% of that at the age of three weeks. The size of the specimen, which affects the shrinkage and the confinement of the concrete, proves to be a significant factor of bond reduction. Curing of concrete also proves to be a contributing factor to the strength of bond. Increase in temperature reduces the strength of bond. The reduction is significantly higher for high temperatures. At 600° C the bond strength is less than 20% of that at room temperature.

AB - It is known that the consideration of tension stiffening effect resulting from bond slip between reinforcement and surrounding concrete is very effective for the deformation analysis of reinforced concrete members. In the paper, the crack strain is defined as the derivative of the bond slip. Bond characteristics between the concrete and the steel are directly related to the crack spacing and crack width. The tension stiffening effect is derived to be evaluated by the factor λ. Furthermore, constitutive equations of composite materials of concrete and reinforcement in a two‐dimensional stress field with multiple‐crack orientation are developed, using stress reduction and reinforcement tensors. The proposed model can successfully represent the nonlinear behavior of multiple‐cracked reinforced concrete resulting from damage by cracking, etc., and is formulated so that the material tensors are directly applicable to nonlinear finite element analysis through the use of the concept of the smeared crack model. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical calculations. Reasonable agreement is obtained.

AB - The effect of base uplift on the maximum response of single‐degree‐of‐freedom (SDOF) structures is examined in this paper. A parametric investigation performed for the case of a rigid foundation and a harmonic excitation shows that the maximum deformation is greatly affected by the ratio of the period of the structure to the period of the excitation, while the effects of the amplitude of the excitation, the slenderness of the structure, and its damping are much less. Based on these results an empirical formula for the estimation of the peak response is established. Using this formula and the classical response spectrum, derived for the fixed‐base system, an approximate method is proposed for the estimation of the maximum earthquake deformation with base uplift. The simplified method can also be applied to the case of a flexible foundation, under certain substitutions, based on the classical theory of soil‐structure interaction. Using modal decomposition, the response of multi‐degree‐of‐freedom systems can also be predicted. The results show that uplift is beneficial to the structure for a wide range of natural periods but leads to a larger response for short periods.

AB - A number of two‐dimensional finite element analyses of timber finger joints have appeared in the literature in the past. In most instances, these involve the use of high aspect ratio elements to model the glue line. The use of such elements is usually regarded as inappropriate because of the numerical difficulties associated with the high ratio of stiffnesses parallel and normal to the glue line. The mathematical basis of special bond‐line elements is examined, and these elements are then applied to the analysis of finger‐joint profiles of varying geometry. It is recommended, on the basis of these analyses, that manufacturers should favor short, low‐pitch, fine‐tipped finger geometries.

AB - A simplified procedure is presented to determine the maximum earthquake forces in intake‐outlet towers directly from the design earthquake spectrum without the need for a response‐history analysis. All the significant effects of tower‐water interaction and tower‐foundation‐soil interaction are included in the analysis. The hydrodynamic effects of outside and inside water are approximated by added mass functions, which can be determined to a useful degree of accuracy without requiring rigorous three‐dimensional analysis of the two fluid domains. The simplified response spectrum analysis (SRSA) procedure utilizes convenient methods for computing: (1) The first two natural frequencies and modes of vibration of the tower; and (2) the modifications to the vibration period and the damping ratio of the fundamental vibration mode due to tower‐foundation‐soil interaction. The procedure is demonstrated to be accurate enough for preliminary design and safety evaluation of towers.

AB - A general strategy for estimating the failure probability of the class of structural systems for which each deterministic structural analysis is expensive is proposed. The strategy is interactive, sequential, and iterative. It relies upon the user to interpret and generate information about the system through the use of appropriate techniques such as directed experimental design, sampling techniques, response surface, and first‐ and second‐order reliability methods. In the strategy, one tries to obtain increasingly accurate representations of the more important failure regions and use these representations to arrive at an estimate of the system failure probability. The goal is to obtain an estimate with the minimum number of structural analyses. There are no concrete steps in the strategy. The steps taken for each problem are decided by the user. The strategy was applied to two examples. The purpose of the first example, which is a simple truss structure with brittle components subjected to a static load, is to demonstrate the strategy in greater detail. In the second example, a first estimate of the probability of failure of an offshore structure was obtained using the strategy.

AB - This paper reports the dynamic responses of a one‐fifth‐scale gable‐frame structure composed of tapered members subjected to El Centro earthquake ground motions, using a shaking table. The test structure was designed according to the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) working stress design method. The width‐thickness ratio of the flange and the depth‐thickness ratio of the web of the members satisfy the requirements of a compact section. The unbraced length also meets the criteria for a compact section based on the dimensions of the shallow‐end cross section. Failure of the test structure is due to lateral buckling of rafters. No local buckling prior to the lateral buckling is observed. The experimentally determined ultimate strength of the test structure is compared with those predicted by the codes AISC load and resistance factor design (LRFD), AS 1250, and BS 5950. The experimental results are also compared with those of a similarly designed gable frame composed of prismatic members, tested under similar conditions.

AB - An experimental study is conducted to investigate the effects of steel fiber reinforcement on the cyclic behavior of dowel bars in the conditions of beam‐column interfaces. The steel fibers used in this investigation were hooked‐end with an aspect (length‐to‐diameter) ratio of 60. Four different fiber volume fractions (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) were considered. The dowel bars were grade 60 with a diameter of 1 in. (25.4 mm), and the concrete had an average compressive strength of 5.0 ksi (34.5 MPa). The cylic dowel test results indicated that dowel strength tends to increase with increase in the volume fraction of steel fibers. Steel fiber reinforcement also improved the hysteretic energy absorption capacity of the dowel mechanism, and reduced the deterioration of the mechanism under repeated cyclic deformations with relativelyl large deformations in the nonlinear range of behavior. These deformations are particularly beneficial under the effect of severe earthquake excitations.

AB - The experimental results from reversed cyclic loading tests on 12 corner‐reinforced concrete beam‐column subassemblies are presented. The primary variables were the concrete compressive strength, ranging between 8.1 and 13.6 ksi (55.8 and 93.8 MPa); the joint shear stress, which was either 1,100 or 1,400 psi (7.6 or 9.7 MPa); and the joint transverse reinforcement, which consisted of either four or six sets of hoops and ties placed within the depth of the joint. The provided joint reinforcement was lower than that obtained by inserting the higher concrete‐compressive‐strength values into the current recommendations. A small axial load was applied to the column portion of the subassembly and held constant during the test. The free end of the beam was subjected to cyclic displacements representing a wide range from elastic to severe inelastic loading. It is concluded that in spite of the brittle nature of plain high‐strength concrete, properly detailed frames constructed with high‐strength concrete exhibit ductile hysteretic response similar to those for ordinary‐strength connections.

The model includes the nonlinear behavior of the connectors between the sheathing and framing, bearing effects between adjacent sheathing panels, and the effects of out‐of‐plane bending of the sheathing elements. The ability of the numerical model to accurately predict the nonlinear behavior of timber shear walls is examined in detail. Comparisons with an experimental investigation, consisting of seven static shear wall tests, are made to show that both the stiffness and ultimate load capacity of the shear walls are modeled accurately. Corrections, based on recent test results, have been made to the test data used to verify the numerical accuracy of the model.

AB - This paper deals with the application of continuum damage mechanics to the description of the response of reinforced concrete members. Two simplifying assumptions are made: (1) The constitutive law of concrete is the isotropic damage law; and (2) there are no displacement discontinuities at the interface between steel and concrete (this last statement is probably true only if ribbed reinforcing bars are considered). Numerical implementations face the same pathological difficulties related to strain softening and damage localization in shear bands near the steel bars. This problem and its consequence, mesh‐dependency, were solved by using the “nonlocal continuum with local strain” approach. Predictions of pull‐out tests are in very good agreement with test data, including size effect data. The study shows that it is possible to extend the nonlocal damage approach easily to the prediction of the response of reinforced concrete structures.

AB - Considerable use of blocks has made it necessary to draft a Sri Lankan standard on cement blocks. For the determination of compressive strength of blocks, several internationally used methods are available. Because the blocks used are of low strength, usefulness of these methods was uncertain. This led to the formulation of a suitable test method and comparison of its performance with that of methods used widely in other countries, and some variations based on them. The study considered four test methods and the influence of the variables, height‐breadth ratio, and mix proportions on the compressive strength values given by those test methods. The tests were designed to determine the reproducibility and repeatability of each test method, as well as to facilitate statistical analysis. The test method recommended the adoption of one part cement to one part sand capping with plywood packings.

AB - This paper suggests an optimization‐based design methodology for improving the strength and overall stability of framed structures, the capacities of which are governed by inelastic limit‐load behavior. The optimization objective function, comprising the dominant linearized buckling eigenvalue of the structure weighted by a frequency‐dependent penalty function, is motivated by a simple model of nonlinear frame behavior. Designs are constrained to have constant weight. The method requires only the linearized buckling eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the structure, avoiding computationally intensive nonlinear structural analyses in the design cycle. An iterative optimality‐criteria method is used to solve the optimization problem. Several examples are given to examine the performance of the procedure, both in terms of robustness of the numerical algorithm and the quality of the designs it produces. By way of example, it is shown that by improving the overall stability characteristics of a structure under static loading, the dynamic performance of the structure is often improved.

AB - This paper suggests an optimization‐based design methodology for improving the strength and the overall stability characteristics of framed structures whose capacities are governed by limit‐load behavior. Attention is focused on space‐framed structures under static loads, and represents a natural extension of the basic ideas presented in the companion paper. The optimization objective function is taken here to be a linear combination of the critical buckling eigenvalues of the structure. A constant volume constraint with bounds on the design variables is used in conjunction with an optimality‐criterion approach for search. The present approach avoids the need to know the eigenvector that dominates the response as the structure passes a limit load. A novel approach to solving problems with multiple loading conditions is introduced wherein each eigenvalue in the objective is weighted in accordance with the participation of that mode in the loading. Several examples are given to demonstrate aspects of the behavior of the proposed design procedure.

AB - Monte Carlo simulation is used to investigate the relationship between the fatigue lives of short‐prestressing strand test specimens and strand stay cables. Cable lives are calculated using statistics determined from the results of fatigue tests of prestressing strand specimens. The cable modeling accounts for the effects of cable length and the number of cable strands on the fatigue life. Three different probability distributions are used to characterize the scatter in the fatigue lives of strand test specimens. Comparisons are made between cable lives calculated using each of the distributions. The predicted cable life is found to be sensitive to the distribution that is used. The distributions produce similar conclusions concerning the relationship between cable length, number of strands, and cable‐fatigue life with the short test specimen behavior.

AB - The paper presents a rational method for predicting the load‐carrying capacity of a short, thin‐walled cylinder under combined loading. The elastic critical stresses for the perfect cylinder are found from the codes and multiplied by the knock‐down factors to account for the buckle imperfection. The factors are derived from the classical theory and correspond to the actual imperfection amplitude. The axial and hydrostatic pressure causes membrane stresses and bending moments due to the oval imperfection of the cross section. These moments are calculated by a plate theory, where the stiffness is reduced due to the limited value of the elastic critical stresses of the imperfect cylinder. The capacity is determined by inserting these moments and membrane stresses into von Mise's yield equation. The theory provides a good and slightly conservative estimate of the experimental results and explains the significant variation from code to code of the interaction curves. The results are easily applied to the practical design of offshore structures.

AB - The dynamic behavior of skewed reinforced concrete (RC) box girder bridges under the effect of earthquake excitation is studied using finite element models of the Foothill Boulevard Undercrossing, S. E. Bridge, in the San Fernando Valley, Calif., which suffered a great damage during the 1971 earthquake. Linear as well as nonlinear models were considered in this study for the time‐history analysis of the bridge. The time‐history analyses showed that rigid‐body modes dominated the earthquake response of the bridge, which led to the writers' conclusion that under dynamic loads, short stiff skewed bridges behave essentially as rigid bodies if the deck is not rigidly fixed to the abutments. This paper gives an explanation of the seismic failure of rigid skewed RC bridges that agrees with the field observation made soon after the failure of the Foothill Boulevard Under‐crossing.

AB - The load and resistance factor design (LRFD) specification introduces two parameters, denoted X1, and X2, which are a confusing conglomeration of material and section properties. These two parameters can be approximated by a simple function of flange thickness and section depth, which allows for a clearer interpretation of these two terms. It is shown that these two yerms describe the relative bending efficiency of a W-shape; as X1 decreases and X2 increases, bending efficiency increases. The approximations for X1 and X2 lead to a simplifying approximation for the rather complicated LRFD equation for the elastic lateral-torsional buckling moment of a standard W-shape. A family of curves based on approximate equations for nominal bending stress as a function of Lb/ry is plotted. These curves can be used to compute an approximation for nominal bending moment for a given W-shape.
