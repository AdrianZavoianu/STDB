AB - An application of the transfer‐matrix technique to the nonlinear dynamic analysis of coupled shear walls is presented. Through the proposed method, the problem is reduced to a tractable size without the imposition of severe uniformity conditions on the structure. The dynamic response is determined by a step‐by‐step numerical approach in which the properties of the structural elements are updated according to the current state of deformation and yield. The transfer‐matrix formulation adopts established models of material behavior in dealing with inelastic beam deformation and load reversals. The dynamic solution assumes constant properties within short time increments, and relies on the kinematic relationships of the Wilson‐θ method. Damping has also been taken into account through a simple viscous model. The effectiveness and accuracy of the method, as well as its potential for further development, are assessed by comparing its predictions with measured displacements of model structures subjected to various base motions.

AB - The first step of the nonlinear procedure consists in finding the solution of the elasticity problem for a doubly reinforced concrete slab. Ten different cracking patterns are assumed in this formulation. Use of each pattern implies the division of slab thickness into several layers (maximum three layers of concrete). This enables the replacing of the summation of constituent stiffnesses over the layers, as is the case in the layered method, by the appropriate analytical or simple numerical integration through the total thickness. This method allows for the nonlinear analysis of relatively low numerical effort in comparison with layered analysis, although the tips of the considered cracks need not lie on the interfaces of the layers. Results obtained in the proposed approach are compared with experimental evidence from tests performed on deep beams and slabs published by other researchers.

AB - The effect of dead loads on the natural frequencies of uniform elastic beams is examined by means of a governing equation that takes into account the effect of dead loads. First, a governing equation including the effect of dead loads is presented briefly. Second, the effect of dead loads on natural frequencies is confirmed by the results of numerical computations using the Galerkin method for simply supported and fixed beams. It is shown that the natural frequencies are raised when the effect of dead loads is included. Third, the natural frequencies for simply supported beams, including the effect of dead loads, are presented in a closed‐form solution by means of suitable assumptions. The solution shows good agreement with the results obtained from the Galerkin method. The key physical factors governing the effect of dead loads in simply supported beams are extracted from the proposed solution.

AB - Conventional element assembly process based on the initial configuration of structures does not necessarily imply the satisfaction of compatibility conditions in the deformed state. This may result in a violation to the rule that all physical relations should be specified for deformed structures in a buckling analysis. Based on an exact consideration of the interelement compatibility for structural members, one can derive a joint matrix for internally generated moments and a moment matrix for externally applied moments, in addition to the elastic and geometric stiffness matrices commonly used in nonlinear analysis. To highlight the linking between the fundamental mechanics equations and their finite element counterparts, the present derivation will be made only for planar frames that are allowed to buckle both in and out of plane. The validity of the present procedure is confirmed in the numerical examples.

It is demonstrated that the use of the hybrid‐stress model removes the necessity for a finite element shear‐correction factor, which can be determined through a deflection‐matching analysis at the formulation stage of two‐node anisoparametric displacement model elements. The element is assessed by static, dynamic, and stability test problems.

AB - Component subsystems in light‐frame wood buildings are tested to provide information useful in analyzing and designing for seismic and dynamic wind effects. Static cyclic tests on shear‐wall panels show that damping ratio increases with panel displacement, whereas static cyclic tests on bending panels show that damping ratio initially increases with panel displacement, but begins to decrease when displacements reach a certain level. Connection subsystems between floors, foundation, and walls—tested on a shaking table under steady‐state vibration (perpendicular or parallel to the foundation length) at prescribed constant panel‐displacement amplitudes—display structural degradation under repeated frequency scans as displacement amplitudes increase. In flexible connection panels (those with walls), dynamic stiffness decreases with increasing displacement amplitude; damping rapidly increases at small displacement amplitudes, then gradually decreases at larger amplitudes. Rigid connection panels (those without walls) are characterized by damping that increases, and stiffness that decreases, at an almost linear rate, as displacement amplitudes grow larger. The testing procedure for connection panels gives consistent, reliable results and should be valuable for modeling degrade in such subsystems.

AB - The wood industry is developing a load and resistance factor design (LRFD) specification for wood construction. Specification provisions are intended to apply to light‐frame as well as heavy, engineered timber construction. The current national design specification contains a repetitive use factor, which permits allowable stresses in light‐frame construction to be increased by 15% under certain conditions (no less than three members, spaced no more than 24 in. on center, joined by a floor, roof, or other load‐distributing element). This factor accounts for load sharing and partially composite action in a simple way. A factor that serves a similar purpose in LRFD can be determined on the basis of a system reliability analysis of a simple model representing a light‐frame floor system. This analysis accounts for duration‐of‐load (DOL) effects, which are known to be significant in wood construction. The analysis shows that the load sharing and DOL effects are interrelated, and that failure to include the DOL effect in system reliability analysis leads to an overly optimistic appraisal of the system effect.

AB - A retrofit strengthening technique for improving the seismic behavior of a nonductile reinforced concrete (RC) frame was investigated experimentally. The original frame contained deep, stiff spandrel beams and short, flexible columns that were susceptible to shear failure under lateral loads. The strengthening technique used a steel X‐bracing system attached to the exterior of the frame using epoxy‐grouted dowels. A two‐thirds‐scale frame model consisting of two bays and three levels was subjected to statically applied cyclic lateral load. Test results indicated substantial increases in both lateral stiffness and strength. The lateral capacity of the strengthened frame was governed by brace buckling and eventual connection failures and column shear failures. Measured brace buckling loads agreed well with predicted capacities assuming fixed (K=0.5) connections, and dowel performance was excellent. Bracing‐system elements attached to the side faces of the concrete columns also substantially increased column shear capacities.

AB - Prestressing tendons can be affected by corrosion or mechanical damage. The paper deals with prestressed structural systems consisting of a prestressed precast concrete beam and a cast‐in‐place slab. Noncomposite and composite beams with bonded tendons are considered. Procedures are developed for the analysis of uncracked and cracked sections. The moment‐curvature relationship is obtained using the developed algorithms and formulas. The formulas are derived for the curvature corresponding to cracking stress, decompression, and ultimate moment. Three algorithms are formulated for iterative procedures. The objective of algorithm one is to determine the moment and rotation axis location corresponding to a given curvature. Algorithm two can be used to determine the curvature and rotation axis location for a given moment. The third algorithm is used to determine the axial strain when the beam is subjected to dead‐load moment. The analysis is based on stress‐strain curves for materials (steel and concrete) and other parameters. For linear elastic materials a closed‐form solution is derived. Even though the moment‐curvature relationship for a typical prestressed concrete beam is nonlinear, its lower part, within the design load range, is very close to linear. The procedures are demonstrated on a typical prestressed concrete bridge girder. Moment‐curvature relationships are obtained for various degrees of tendon‐area loss.

The critical weights of various typical vehicle configurations are calculated for several representative two‐ and three‐span bridge designs, including examples of both service‐load design and load‐factor design bridges.

The proposed formula allows removal or raising of the existing arbitrary 80,000 lb gross vehicle weight limit associated with the current formula while protecting bridges from excessive levels of stress.

AB - Roof systems constructed using cold‐formed steel components, i.e., Z‐shaped purlins and interconnected roof panels, have become a very popular form of construction. This roof system is used extensively for single‐story commercial and industrial buildings in the United States. The popularity of cold‐formed steel members is due in part to their superior gravity load strength‐to‐weight ratio; however, because of their relatively light weight, a cold‐formed member is very susceptible to wind uplift loading. The design specification in the United States for cold‐formed steel construction does not provide a comprehensive analytical solution to the problem of wind uplift strength of a cold‐formed steel purlin. A general analytical approach, based on the concept of biaxial bending, is presented for evaluating the load capacity of a cold‐formed steel roof system having a Z‐shaped purlin. The analytical approach is applicable only for a through‐fastened roof system, i.e., a roof system for which the roof panel is attached to the purlin by a self‐drilling or self‐tapping screw.

AB - The experimental response of a single‐story, indeterminate reinforced concrete (RC) frame with floor slabs is investigated in this paper. The frame was quarter‐scale and tested under static lateral‐load reversals simulating earthquake load. The internal force redistribution occurring within the inelastic range of response and the beam flexural overstrength resulting from slab contribution are evaluated. It is shown that the pattern of lateral‐load distribution in indeterminate structures is severely affected by the partial restraint that continuity imposes on the inelastic member expansion, particularly at large levels of lateral displacement. Specimen behavior is characterized in terms of strength, stiffness, lateral drift ratio, and plastic hinge‐formation. The mechanism by which shear is introduced to beam‐column joints of connections with floor slabs is examined. The performance of the current code recommendations for design of beam‐column joints is investigated in view of the combined effects of continuity and contribution of floor‐slabs to the flexural resistance of the beams.

AB - If a wire within a suspension bridge cable should break, it is of interest to know over what length from the break the wire will carry its full share of the cable force. This length is called the development length. It is shown theoretically that this length depends on the tightness of the cable wrapping or clamping bands, but that this dependence is not very strong. As long as there is some tightness in the cable the development length is quite small. Very high contact stresses will develop between the broken wire and its neighbors due to Poisson's ratio. Whether the high contact stresses affect the strength of these wires is not investigated.

AB - A shake‐table study of the friction‐pendulum isolation system, installed in a six‐story, quarter‐scale, 52‐kip model structure, is presented. Two bearing materials are studied, one with a peak friction coefficient of 0.075 and another of 0.095. In both cases, the isolation system has a rigid‐body mode period of 1 sec. The isolated structure is found to be capable of withstanding strong earthquake forces of different frequency content. In tests with the El Centra motion, the isolated structure sustains, without any damage, a peak ground acceleration six times greater than what it could under fixed‐based conditions. It is found that the bearing displacements are low and that the permanent bearing displacements at the end of free vibration are very small, in general, not exceeding 6% of the bearing design displacement. The system is shown to have quantifiable properties, and analytical techniques are presented that provide accurate prediction of the response.

AB - The in‐plane flexibility of floor‐slab systems has been observed to influence the seismic response of many types of reinforced concrete buildings. The assumption of rigid floor diaphragms is often used to simplify engineering analyses without significant loss in the accuracy of seismic response prediction for most buildings. However, for certain classes of structures, such as long and narrow buildings (especially with dual‐braced lateral load‐resisting systems), and buildings with horizontal (T‐ or L‐shaped) or vertical (setbacks or cross‐walls) offsets, the effect of diaphragm flexibility cannot be disregarded. Moreover, if the floor slab panels experience cracking or yielding due to pronounced in‐plane distortions, the seismic response of the entire building system may be significantly altered. This paper presents an simplified macromodeling scheme to incorporate the effect of inelastic floor flexibility in the seismic response analysis of RC buildings. The slab model includes effects of both in‐plane flexure and shear. The inelastic behavior of diaphragms is emphasized through a study of narrow rectangular buildings with end walls. The study shows that the in‐plane deflections of floor slabs impose a larger demand on strength and ductility of flexible frames than predicted values using the assumption of rigid or elastic slabs. These demands may in turn lead to a failure of the gravity‐load supporting system. A quantitative estimate of this effect is presented in terms of the floor aspect ratios.

AB - A discrete field analysis approach was used to develop a solution procedure for the analysis of guyed towers. Three truss tower configurations were considered in which the three tower legs formed the apexes of an equilateral triangle and the truss configuration on the faces of the tower were either: (1) X‐braced; (2) Warren; or (3) Vierendeel. The modeling of the tower was exact in the sense that only the usual assumptions of linear elastic behavior were used. Thus, all forces and moments in each member can be computed. The tower modeling was combined with an algorithm for including the effects of the nonlinear cable/tower interaction. The results were programmed for use on a personal computer with a problem‐oriented language enabling the user to interact as part of the design process. To illustrate the utility of the program, a 700‐ft (214‐m) tower was comparatively analyzed with an X‐braced, Warren, and Vierendeel configuration. It was found that the Warren configuration was superior to the X‐braced in terms of material required, while direct comparisons with the Vierendeel could not be made without completing the design for each.

AB - A sliding isolation system consisting of Teflon disc bearings and helical steel springs is described. The springs carry no vertical load and provide bilinear restoring force without hysteresis when deformed in shear. The Teflon disc bearings carry the entire weight of the structure. The isolation system is designed so that the mobilized peak frictional force is larger, by at least a factor of two, than the peak restoring force. Under these conditions the system has a low sensitivity to the frequency content of the input. The system has been evaluated in shake‐table tests of a six‐story, quarter‐scale, 52‐kip (230‐kN) model structure, and is capable of withstanding strong earthquake forces of significant differences in frequency content. Furthermore, the springs are effective in controlling bearing displacements. Also, tests have been carried out without restoring force. In this case excessive permanent displacements are recorded as a result of a small accidental inclination of the sliding bearings. Finally, analytical techniques are presented that provide good prediction of the observed behavior.

AB - Cold‐formed steel channel struts are structural elements often used in the fabrication of double‐layer grid‐space frames. Fabrication and assembly considerations sometimes require joint configurations that cause members to be eccentrically loaded. This paper reports a study of the behavior of eccentrically loaded, cold‐formed steel, lipped‐channel compression members of a space frame system. The behavior is separated into three regimes of prebuckling, buckling, and postbuckling responses. Beam‐column behavior and torsional‐flexural buckling are included. The primary response considered is the relationship between the axial force and shortening. The peak loads are given by the secant formula for negative eccentricities between the shear center and close to the centroid. For small negative eccentricities close to the centroid and for positive eccentricities, the torsional‐flexural buckling load controls. However, because of restraint of warping mechanisms at the supports, the capacity was greater than predicted. For larger positive eccentricities, the secant formula again controls. Three different postbuckling models for axial load versus shortening are investigated and show good agreement with the tests.

AB - An attempt is made to determine the fatigue strength of some metal ties. The ties are subjected to various displacements at their ends in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the ties, using a double-acting jack. For 25-mm displacement or less at the ends of the ties, the ties showed very little signs of distress after 20,000 cycles. However, for displacements of as much as 75 mm, some ties failed at or near the point of nailing after about 700 cycles. Owing to the great flexibility of the ties, failure occurs about the point of rotation of the ties, usually in the form of bends and presses. It was also observed that after visible cracks have appeared, it can take 100 or more cycles before the tie completely fails. For galvanized ties, the zinc starts coming off at the points upon which the ties rotate. This can have great implications regarding the corrosion of the ties.
