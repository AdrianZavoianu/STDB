AB - A B‐spline bracing element of arbitrary orientation is developed and combined with the B‐spline compound strip method (BCSM) to analyze structures having bracing members. In the BCSM, a problem is first partially discretized to an ordinary differential equation by the finite element method. Then, the equation is solved using the Ritz‐Galerkin method with unequally spaced cubic B‐spline functions. The BCSM uses a special element “strip.” The strip is described as a product of the longitudinal cubic B‐spline series and transverse finite element polynomial shape functions. The bracing element is treated as a space frame element. For including the stiffness contribution of the bracing element, transformation and interpolation matrices are derived. A direct stiffness formulation is used. This technique eliminates the repetitive solutions required for each redundant in a flexibility approach based on the traditional finite strip method (FSM). The simplicity, accuracy, and convenience of this presented method are verified by the numerical examples.

AB - The seismic behavior of steel frames with and without a concrete slab on a steel beam is investigated by the pseudodynamic test method. Importance is attached to the effects on the response behavior of the frames to (1) The presence of a concrete slab; (2) differences in the natural period of frames with a concrete slab; and (3) differences in concrete slab stiffness. The maximum acceleration of the El Centro North‐South (NS) (1940) was amplified to approximately 0.95 times the yield acceleration (the ratio of a frame yield lateral force to the frame mass) of the frames. To examine the safety of the frames analyzed by the pseudodynamic tests, cyclic loading tests are performed on frames similar to those of the pseudodynamic test and their restoring force characteristics obtained. These analyses indicate that the presence of a concrete slab greatly affects the response behavior of the frame. The maximum lateral displacements and the maximum beam rotations are smaller than the maximum stable amplitudes of the lateral displacement and the rotation in the cyclic tests, respectively.

AB - An experimental investigation of the behavior of brick masonry under cyclic biaxial compressive loading is presented. The experimental investigation involved biaxial tests on 45 half‐scale brick masonry specimens. Three types of tests were conducted to establish the envelope stress‐strain curve, the common point curve, and the stability point curve. A general empirical equation is proposed for these curves that compares well with the experimental data. A failure criterion expressed in terms of principal stress invariants is suggested. The use of the stability point curve as an aid in defining the permissible stress level for brick masonry under cyclic biaxial compressive loading and the importance of relating the stability point to the level of residual strain in the material is discussed.

AB - This paper describes the construction of structural sandwich panels by wrapping reinforcing fabric around a foam board, then dipping it in a mortar slurry and screeding away excess mortar. A design procedure is described for obtaining the relative face, core, and reinforcing thicknesses to satisfy panel structural constraints at minimum material cost and at minimum weight for these faces, which have unequal tensile and compressive stiffnesses. Design is illustrated for a panel bending stiffness constraint. Stiffness/weight and stiffness/material cost ratios have been studied as a function of the amount of mineral wool added as a supplementary reinforcement stiffener. Stiffness/weight ratios are compared to those of pre‐stressed hollow‐core concrete decks. Potential applications include lightweight insulated panels for foundation walls and for walls and roofs of small buildings. Potential advantages include the elimination of concrete footing and foundation‐wall insulation costs as well as the reduction of construction time.

AB - The objective of this paper is to consider variations in the overall weight of structures and the resulting changes in fundamental periods, base shears, and spectral characteristics in seismic reliability analyses. A methodology is presented for assessing the annual failure probabilities of critical structural components, as a result of seismic excitation, for elevated liquid‐storage vessels, which typically have highly uncertain weight (mass) fluctuations throughout their service lives because of the changes in the amount of liquid stored in the vessel. A dis‐cretized‐mass mechanical system is used to model the forces induced by sloshing liquid. The seismic load input is obtained by combining the seismic hazard curve of the region and the site‐dependent dynamic amplification spectrum. The various sources of uncertainty are quantified in the analysis and a generalized limit‐state equation is derived for structural components. The analysis of a liquid‐containing elevated spherical vessel 65 ft (20 m) in diameter in the seismically active San Francisco Bay region is presented as an illustrative application of the method.

AB - Stochastic finite‐element based reliability analysis is used to examine the performance of the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) method for steel structures. The reliabilities of members in actual configurations are estimated for both strength and serviceability limit states using the proposed method and compared with the target reliabilities used to derive the LRFD specifications. The dependence of the reliability of a member in an actual structure on the statistical properties of other members, the location of the member in the overall configuration, and the statistical correlations between the various random variables is investigated. The LRFD specifications, which are based on reliability analyses of isolated simple structural elements, are found to result in a conservative design of members in complicated structures, especially when the design is governed by serviceability criteria.

AB - This paper deals with the analysis of dynamic loads in bridges. Models are developed for trucks, road surface (roughness) and the bridge. The statistical parameters are based on the results of surveys, tests and analysis. Truck parameters include the body (mass), suspensions, and tires. Road profiles are simulated using stochastic processes (power spectral density function). A bridge is treated as a prismatic beam. The Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the traffic on the bridge. Random variables include the truck type, total weight, axle distances, and speed. Calculations are carried out for steel and prestressed concrete girder bridges. The dynamic load factors for a bridge design code are calculated based on the 75 year mean maximum loads. The analysis is performed for single trucks and for two trucks (side by side). Dynamic loads are lower for heavier trucks and also lower for two trucks. The calculated static and dynamic deflections are presented in tables and graphs as a function of gross vehicle weight, span and axle distance. Simulated deflections indicate that the dynamic component is not correlated with the static component. Therefore, the dynamic loads are lower for heavier trucks. It is also found that the dynamic loads for two trucks are lower than for single trucks.

AB - The loads acting on railroad tracks due to the. passage of trains have a random character. Similarly, the track resistance parameters exhibit various degrees of randomness. The purpose of this study is to incorporate the random nature of the parameters in the analysis of railroad tracks. The changes in the reliability index are determined for variations of loads and track properties. A rail element is used in the analysis that can incorporate the lateral, torsional, and axial deformations, as well as warping of the rail section. In this analysis, the track components such as fasteners, ties, ballast, and subgrade are incorporated by a set of vertical, lateral, and torsional springs. The finite element method is formulated for the track system in terms of the random variables. The formulation is based on a linear statistical model using the first‐order‐second‐moment method. The reliability index is computed, using the Rackwitz‐Fiessler algorithm, for the limit state function found by the finite element solution. Using the computer program developed, a parametric study is conducted to investigate the effect of the various parameters on the reliability index.

AB - The methods available for proportioning columns in gravity‐loaded steel frames are reviewed and their shortcomings demonstrated. A new design method is then proposed. It does not involve the column effective length factor, K. It makes use of a fictitious lateral load that is a fraction of the story gravity loads. It is shown how the magnitude of the fictitious lateral load is obtained. The proposed method has been compared with the structural analysis K‐factor approach and is shown to be in good agreement. However, it does not create a paradox as the structural analysis K‐factor. The results of this study have been incorporated in CAN3‐S16.1‐M89.

AB - This paper describes the results of tests of 13 reinforced concrete column‐slab specimens, in which the columns are very strong concrete—in the 14‐k/sq in. (96 MPa) compressive strength range—while the intervening floor slabs are much weaker. The slab concretes range from about 3–6 k/sq in. (21 to 42 MPa) compressive strength. In addition to the variation in the slab concrete strength, the slabs represent either interior or edge conditions, and two different slab thicknesses are included. The interest in this series of tests is axial load transmission through the weaker slab concrete, and no moments are imposed on the slab‐column connection. The data are analyzed with two objectives. One is to investigate the general adequacy of section 10.13 of the 1989 ACI code (ACI 318‐89). The provisions do not appear to be conservative when the column concrete is extremely strong. The second goal of the research is to develop a better understanding of the problem, and to develop a better prediction method or procedure.

AB - Test results are presented for nine skew reinforced‐concrete panels subjected to in‐plane uniaxial tension. Data presented include cracking patterns, specimen strains, and steel strains with increasing load. A simple limit analysis is developed to predict the crack angle at ultimate load. Behavior is characterized by the development of initial cracks formed at approximately right angles to the direction of applied load, followed by development of cracks inclined at an angle to the direction of applied load, and finally yielding of the reinforcement. The direction of cracking developed at ultimate load is accurately predicted by the simple limit analysis. Comparisons are made between theoretical and measured loads at initial cracking and at ultimate load. It is expected that the test results presented will prove useful in verifying and calibrating finite element models of cracking in reinforced concrete, where attempts are made to simulate behavior under changing crack patterns as load progresses.

AB - The effects of plan asymmetry on the earthquake response of one‐story systems are identified by comparing the dynamic response of an asymmetric‐plan system and the corresponding symmetric‐plan system for a wide range of system parameters—uncoupled lateral vibration period, uncoupled torsional‐to‐lateral frequency ratio, stiffness eccentricity, and yield factor. Elastic as well as inelastic systems are studied. For the latter, two values of the strength eccentricity are considered: equal to the stiffness eccentricity and zero; the latter is representative of code‐designed buildings. Based on the response results for a wide range of system parameters, this paper identifies how the structural response is affected by plan asymmetry and how these effects differ between elastic and inelastic systems. It is shown that the response of inelastic systems is affected less by plan asymmetry compared to elastic systems. Between the two types of inelastic systems considered, the response of strength‐symmetric systems is affected by plan asymmetry generally to a smaller degree compared to systems with equal strength and stiffness eccentricities.

AB - Results are presented from an experimental study on four reduced‐scale reinforced concrete structural wall specimens. All the specimens are lightly reinforced. One test specimen has a solid web and the other three have varying amounts of horizontal stagger between door openings in successive stories. Specimens are tested in a vertical position under constant axial stress. Reversed cyclic deformations are applied at the top. Generally, ductile flexural behavior is obtained from all four specimens at average drift ratios of 1%. At this stage, there is significant yielding of vertical reinforcement, and an intersecting pattern of flexuralshear cracks has developed, but there is no indication of impending failure. At average drift ratios near 1.5%, all three walls with door openings experience a shear‐compression failure in the first story adjacent to the door opening. Principles of basic mechanics and reinforced concrete theory are used to predict the force‐displacement envelopes for all four wall specimens.

AB - Tension leg platforms (TLPs) are a class of compliant offshore structures that respond dynamically to ocean winds, waves, and currents. A TLP is tied to the ocean floor by tethers that, due to hull buoyancy, are in tension in the absence of environmental loads. Motions of a TLP lead to additional dynamic forces in the tethers. Also, depending on the deck height, there is a small likelihood of waves impacting the TLP deck. Wave impact induces tether forces that increase rapidly as a function of wave‐immersion distance into the deck. In this study, an extension of the point‐crossing method was used to predict the probability of waves impacting the deck of a TLP. This method was also used to predict the combination of dynamic forces (including wave‐impact loads) acting on a TLP tether. The results are used to calculate the reliability of a TLP tether under maximum tension loads.

AB - Acceleration response records obtained during the October 1, 1987 Whittier‐Narrows earthquake (Ms=5.6) from the 32‐story, vertically irregular 1100 Wilshire Finance Building, of which the cross section changes from a nominally rectangular shape to a triangular one, are analyzed. The building was instrumented with 21 channels of synchronized sensors, consisting of 12 uniaxial accelerometers deployed throughout the superstructure and connected to a central recording system and three triaxial strong‐motion accelerographs in the basement. At each of the four levels of the superstructure, three uniaxial accelerometers were deployed, two parallel and at a distance apart, and the third one orthogonal to the parallel pair. The records permit the identification of the predominantly coupled torsional‐translational response of the building and the associated frequency at approximately 0.7–0.8 Hz from the difference between accelerations recorded by the parallel pairs of accelerometers at different levels. This mode corresponds to the second torsional mode. A translational mode at 0.3 Hz is also identified from the records. The center of rigidity of any instrumented level is identified by minimizing the coherence between the relative accelerations and the translational acceleration. Employing system identification techniques provides the modal damping percentage for the second torsional mode as 6–7%.
