AB - The linear elastic behavior of frames with nonprismatic members is investigated by using isoparametric plane stress finite elements. It is determined that the conventional methods of analysis for these types of structures lead to erroneous results. Comparison of the fixed end moments, stiffness, and carry‐over factors of nonprismatic members available in the literature with those computed by finite element analysis reveals large discrepancies. Based on an extensive study, sources and magnitudes of errors are presented. Recommendations for proper modeling by using conventional frame analysis computer programs are made.

AB - An experimental investigation is carried out on eight reinforced‐concrete continuous beams, each containing a large transverse opening. The beams are rectangular in cross section and all contain the same amount and arrangement of longitudinal reinforcement. The number of spans, the size of opening, and its location along the span are considered as major variables. Detailed results of these tests are presented and discussed in this paper. Test results indicate four distinctly different stages of behavior in the load‐deflection curve of a continuous beam. Final failure of the beam occurs by the formation of a mechanism, and the two opening ends represent the most vulnerable locations for the development of plastic hinges. Besides early cracking, the strength and stiffness of the beam decrease with an increase either in the length or depth of opening. Similarly, openings located in a high moment region produce larger deflections and result in early collapse of the beam.

AB - A method is presented in this paper to predict the load‐deflection response of a reinforced‐concrete beam containing a large opening. The load‐deflection curve has been idealized by a piecewise linear relation in which each transition point represents the formation of a plastic hinge. The method of successive elastic analyses is used to trace the formation of hinges until a mechanism is formed. Deflections corresponding to each plastic hinge formation are calculated by linear superposition of deflections caused by flexural action on the entire beam to those produced by shear at the opening. The former is calculated using the conjugate segment analogy while the latter is obtained by treating the chord members as double cantilevers. A comparison of theoretical predictions with test data available on 12 simply supported, three two‐span continuous, and five three‐span continuous beams shows good agreement in load‐deflection relations and modes of failure as well as maximum deflections at calculated service loads, redundant support reactions, and the load at collapse.

AB - The effect of residual stress on the flexural buckling strength of cold‐formed steel columns is studied. Based on the results of 93 column tests and the measured residual stresses, significant relation is observed between the reduction of column strength, the magnitude and distribution of residual stress, and the flat‐width ratio of the plate element of the cold‐formed section. In this study, a new concept called the “second reduction” is developed to account for the effect of the residual stresses on the local buckling behavior of cold‐formed steel columns. Based on this concept, a possible design procedure is outlined for the prediction of the flexural buckling strength of cold‐formed steel columns. The theoretical predictions are found to be in good agreement with the test results.

AB - Masonry arch bridges have been studied for many centuries. Numerous analytical methods have been developed, but mainly for the study of the elastic behavior and ultimate strength of arches. A new approach that embodies the nonlinear finite‐element procedure is introduced herein for the progressive failure analysis of masonry arch bridges. Failure criteria normally used for plain concrete are adopted to define the failure of masonry as a material under all biaxial stress states. This together with the assumed stress‐strain relationships of masonry enables the cracking and crushing of the arch under incremental loading conditions to be analyzed simultaneously. Results for stress distribution, cracking, and crushing at any load level may be traced graphically on a computer. Finally, the iterative procedure produces for the arch the failure load and the associated collapse mechanism. The two‐dimensional effects of spandrel fill on the arch behavior are also included in the analysis. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated using single‐span arches under concentrated loads and subjected to support movements.

AB - Tensegrity structures are freestanding prestressed cable networks in which the cables are prestressed against a discontinuous system of bars. In double‐layer tensegrity grids (DLTGs), the bars are confined between two parallel layers of cables. This paper presents the analytical part of an investigation of a type of DLTG. A first‐order linear analytical model indicates that these structures possess low stiffness and low bar force efficiency. Under full prestress, determined by the condition that no cable is slack under the applied load, the model predicts deflections of approximately 1/20 of the span, and 20% of bar load‐bearing capacity is available for the applied load, the rest being required by prestress. Member forces and deflections are strongly affected by the span, structural depth and level of prestress. Enhancement techniques are discussed.

AB - Tensegrity structures are freestanding prestressed cable networks in which the cables are prestressed against a discontinuous system of bars. In double‐layer tensegrity grids (DLTGs), the bars are confined between two parallel layers of cables. This is the second paper in a two‐part analytical and experimental study of a type of DLTG. The first part, presenting results of a first‐order linear analytical model, indicates that these structures possess low stiffness and low bar force efficiency. The experimental investigation of a small‐scale model indicates that actual response is significantly nonlinear and that both stiffness and bar force efficiency are higher than indicated by the linear model. Member forces due to the applied load are generally higher than the linear model indicates. A nonlinear analytical model is generally in good agreement with the results. The concept, consisting of independent prismatic units, possesses a high degree of structural redundancy. Load‐bearing capacity is practically unaffected by the loss of a member.

AB - Existing techniques of structural analysis for nonlinear composite wood systems under bending/compression loads are combined with probability‐based concepts in evaluating typical wall types of current construction. Material behavior is bilinear: nailed joints exceed the proportional limit first, followed by framing members. Stochastic variables include Weibull distributions for nonlinear moduli of elasticity for framing and parameters of normal and type 1 distributions for wind load. The analysis shows that the walls behave nonlinearly long before final collapse. The walls prove highly reliable, with a probability of failure between 0.000006 and 0.00144. The probability of failure is increased when accounting for the presence of axial load and composite action in the analysis, is unchanged when accounting for errors in lumber grading, and is strongly affected by changes in the variability of the framing modulus of rupture and wind velocity.

AB - A least‐squares curve‐fitting procedure is shown to provide better accuracy than the previously used method of selected points when fitting Richard‐Abbott and Ramberg‐Osgood functions to experimental moment‐rotation data. Comparisons are presented to show that the Richard‐Abbott function, in dimensionless form, provides fits that are comparable to cubic B‐spline fits and more accurate than Ramberg‐Osgood function fits for common connection types. A multiple‐regression analysis procedure is described that employs the Richard‐Abbott function to derive a standardized connection moment‐rotation function. Its advantage over previously used standardization procedures is that it is able to utilize all available experimental data in the derivation of the standardized function. The latter function is expressed in terms of the geometric parameters for the connection type considered.

AB - Two‐dimensional continuum finite elements are used to model a 10‐story reinforced concrete shear‐wall building subjected to in‐plane loadings. The Uniform Building Code‐prescribed seismic lateral force distribution is increased proportionally to building failure. Well‐known material models describe the essential nonlinearities of reinforced concrete. Continuum element models provide a physical, realistic modeling of the nonlinear processes leading to ultimate failure in shear‐wall structures. A parallel analysis is run, using beam‐column elements to model the building shear walls. All nonlinearity is lumped into zero‐length plastic hinges at the beam‐column end nodes. Both analysis models yield similar loaddisplacement responses and predict nearly the same damage patterns and failure mode. However, beam‐column models rely on abstract representations of nonlinearity and require detailed preanalyses to determine appropriate hinge properties. Strengths and weaknesses of each model type are discussed. The building in question performed successfully during the March 1985 earthquake in Chile.

AB - Finite‐element formulations are presented for the analysis of reinforced concrete solids. Cracked reinforced concrete is treated as an orthotropic nonlinear elastic material based on a smeared, rotating crack model. Secant‐stiffness moduli are defined for concrete and reinforcement, and these are used in the development of an eight‐noded regular hexahedral element. Procedures are discussed by which the formulations can be implemented into existing linear elastic algorithms to provide nonlinear analysis capabilities. The constitutive relations implemented in the formulations are relations extrapolated from the two‐dimensional models of the modified compression field theory (MCFT). The accuracy of the constitutive models and finite‐element formulations are examined by analyzing a series of overreinforced beams subjected to bending and torsion. Excellent agreement is found between predicted and observed response. The performance characteristics and potential applications of the analysis procedure are discussed, and areas in need of further research are identified.

AB - Plate systems often involve variable rigidities because of changes in the cross section or reinforcement. The finite strip method provides an efficient method of analysis for some plate configurations. However, in the conventional finite strip and finite element methods each segment with constant rigidity is discretized as an element, even when the segments are unnecessarily small. This could result in a significant increase in the number of elements. This paper presents a procedure for the derivation of a macrostrip with variable rigidity. The macrostrip can be used for modeling variable section members without increasing the number of elements or degrees of freedom. The formulation is for plate systems with step changes of rigidity and is based on the theory of distributions. Thus, plate systems with step changes of rigidity can be handled directly by this method. Continuous variations can be approximated by a series of step changes. To increase the accuracy, the number of steps can be increased without increasing the number of degrees of freedom. Since the algebra involved in the derivation of the macroelement is rather excessive, a set of subroutines are written for the symbolic package MuMath, to carry out the algebraic manipulations.

AB - A simulated annealing strategy is developed for use in the discrete optimization of three‐dimensional steel frames. This strategy randomly perturbs the current design to create a candidate design. A probabilistic acceptance criterion is then employed to determine whether the candidate design should replace the current design or be rejected. This acceptance criterion allows worse designs to be accepted in the initial stages of the strategy. The likelihood of accepting worse designs is small in the final stages of the strategy. The strategy is presented and illustrated on a three‐dimensional, six‐story, unsymmetrical frame. The frame is realistically loaded with gravity and seismic loads. Members in the frame must be selected from among discrete standardized shapes. The strategy is able to treat multiple section properties per member without having to curve‐fit dependent properties as functions of a single independent property. Performance of the strategy is compared to that of the branch‐and‐bound method. Approximation techniques aimed at reducing computation time are investigated.

AB - A nonlinear elastic‐plastic method for analyzing three dimensional beam elements is presented. The method uses the average effect of moment‐axial‐force curvature equations in each bending direction to compute the terms in the element stiffness matrix. The method is applied to the imperfection‐sensitivity investigation of lattice domes made up of tubular members; a space frame representation of lattice domes is employed. First, a class of domes is designed using current specifications in conjunction with a linear frame analysis. Nonlinear elastic‐plastic analyses of the designed dome are carried out to determine the relationship between the design load and the actual failure load. Koiter's approach to imperfection sensitivity is carried out in a discrete finite element form with linear mode shapes used as geometric imperfections. It is found that imperfection sensitivity is a function of the dome's rise‐to‐span ratio. Domes with a high ratio may be dominated by inelastic behavior rather than imperfection sensitivity.

AB - Energy methods previously developed for the shakedown analyses of framed structures are extended to include structures subjected to cyclically varying loads in the presence of constant, or bias, loads. This approach is based on the hypothesis that, if the total hysteresis energy absorbed by a structure during an indefinitely prolonged repetitive loading program is unbounded, then the structure must ultimately fail. This hypothesis leads to results that are entirely consistent with the classical shakedown theorems. Several illustrative examples demonstrate that the incremental collapse envelopes of framed structures subjected to cyclically varying patterns of loading can be drastically reduced when constant loads are present. These results are essentially due to inelastic interactions between the cyclic and constant loads that magnify the effects of hysteresis. In fact, the reduction in the safe loading ranges (as defined by the incremental collapse envelope) can be a sensitive function of the constant, or bias, load components.

AB - Using the finite element code, ABAQUS, along with user‐developed subroutines and experimentally derived material constants, an incremental construction analysis including thermal loads is performed on a pile‐founded massconcrete lock and dam structure. The modeling, analysis technique, and algorithm involved in performing such an analysis is presented. The computer model is based upon a two‐dimensional, nonlinear incremental analysis that includes the effects of creep, shrinkage, and aging Young's modulus. The presented algorithm is intended to provide a means of assessing a mass‐concrete structures vulnerability to thermal stresses and possible cracking during the construction process. A discussion of the key assumptions and studies that were used in the development of the algorithm are presented. Results from the analyses of a typical lock monolith from the Melvin Price Locks and Dam on the Mississippi River at Alton, Ill. will also be presented to illustrate the usefulness of the algorithm.

AB - The influence of small stress ranges on a recently proposed sequencedependent fatigue damage model is examined. The damage model is capable of including sequence effects by taking into account the interaction of neighboring cycles in predicting the fatigue damage accumulation. The parameters necessary for use of the damage model are obtained using a combined experimental and empirical approach. The model is modified here to ignore stress cycles below a truncation level that is consistent with the endurance limit of the specimens under constant amplitude loads. It is shown that with this modification, the damage model gives fatigue life predictions that compare very well with experimental results for a wide variety of stochastic loads. Additional experimental investigation with different specimen geometry and material is needed to further examine the validity of the proposed damage model and the extent to which the parameters needed to use this model are geometry‐ and material‐dependent.

AB - The ASTM Standard E-119 specifies that when a structural component is fire-tested by exposing one surface to a standard fire exposure, the component fails if the temperature of the unexposed surface of the test component rises 250°F (130°C) or more during the rating period. The standard fire exposure usually is not representative of the compartment temperatures that develop during an actual fire, and the test results may not be indicative of how components might actually behave. In particular, the standard test may give an overly pessimistic appraisal of the behavior of concrete components greater than 76 mm (3 in.) thick and that have excellent insulating characteristics. Design economies might be achieved by allowing the use of natural fire exposures rather than one universal test in assigning fire ratings and in fire-resistant structural design.
