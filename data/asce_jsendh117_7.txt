AB - The various steps of the design of tensegric shells are studied. The selection of the tensegric net and fitting it to a tensegric shell of a desired configuration is discussed. The effect of prestressing the shell: the forces induced into the members of the shell and the nodal displacements, are investigated. It is shown that linear algebra can be used to determine the nodal displacements as well as the forces induced by the prestressing. Minimum distortion of the tensegric shell due to prestressing is considered.

AB - An experimental investigation of the shear strengths of composite plate girders, with centrally placed rectangular web cutouts, is described. A series of tests is conducted on short‐span girders having conventional welded stud shear connectors, connecting the composite concrete slabs to the top flanges of the plate girders. These tests indicated that it is the tensile or pullout capacity of the connectors that is primarily responsible for sustaining the composite action under predominantly shear loading. Subsequently, a further series of tests is conducted on short‐span girders with bolted tension connectors, designed to offer negligible resistance to horizontal shear forces at the interfaces between the concrete slabs and plate girders, which confirmed the previous conclusion. Both series of tests indicate that if adequate connectors are provided between a plate girder and a composite concrete slab, the shear strength of the composite girder is significantly higher than that of the plate girder alone. A simple analytical model for predicting the shear strengths of composite plate girders is also presented, which shows satisfactory correlation with the test results.

AB - Most available methods of predicting the buckling loads of layered and spaced timber columns are analytical methods. These are only suitable for columns with constant number and spacing of connectors in each joint of the columns. For added strength and for practical reasons, columns with additional connectors at the ends are more desirable. This usually requires the use of a numerical method for the prediction of their buckling loads. This paper presents a simple numerical method that can be used on microcomputers to predict the buckling loads of these columns. The method is based on the matrix progression technique. The slip modulus of the connectors adopted in the program is that of the Kuenzi beam on elastic foundation method. To verify the method, 89 layered and spaced timber columns were built and tested. The method was also compared with the Pleskov method.

AB - The elastic‐plastic behavior and ultimate strength of test beams with U‐shaped holes in the top part of the web are experimentally investigated. Nine welded, built‐up, simply supported beams with three different ratios of web depth to height of the U‐shaped holes are tested under one concentrated load. The test results are compared with analytical results based on the finite element method, the beam theory, and the ultimate strength method, taking account of Vierendeel action. The predictions of the bending stresses, the shearing stresses, and the ultimate strength for such beams is obtained with comparatively good accuracy.

AB - A nonlinear finite element procedure for the pre‐ and postbuckling analysis of thin‐walled box‐section beam‐columns is presented. The influence of local plate buckling upon the overall ultimate buckling behavior of the member is incorporated in the analysis by adopting a set of modified‐stress‐versus‐strain curves for axially loaded plates. Factors such as residual stresses, associated with hot‐rolled and cold‐formed sections, and initial geometrical imperfections are accounted for in the analysis. A number of examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method.

AB - That straight‐beam elements cannot be used to study the buckling of curved beams is an incorrect argument made by previous researchers. The inconsistency originates largely from their overlooking the moment terms induced by initial bending moments undergoing three‐dimensional rotations, which, in principle, is a violation to the rule that all physical relations should be defined for the deformed structure in a buckling analysis. In this paper, emphasis will be placed on the establishment of a consistent straight‐beam element considering both the effects of induced moments and interelement compatibilities. The derived element, also known as the semitangential element, serves not only as a good substitute for the curved‐beam elements, but as an effective means for judging the rationality of competing curved‐beam theories.

AB - Despite several recent experimental and analytical programs on shell buckling, there is a lack of studies examining the characteristics of imperfection patterns produced by manufacturing. As a result, differing conclusions can be reached in strength assessment and in evaluating code recommendations, depending on imperfection‐modeling assumptions. A number of small‐scale stringer‐stiffened cylinders, all manufactured by the same method, were tested at Imperial College, London, England. Prior to loading, these models were carefully measured to record their initial imperfections. Data‐reduction techniques were subsequently used to obtain Fourier‐series representations of these surfaces. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a detailed statistical analysis carried out on the Fourier coefficients. Both univariate and correlation statistics are presented for the variables characterizing the imperfection modes. In addition, the fitting of probability distributions is discussed and relevant parameters are presented for the dominant modes. The results show that because of the common manufacturing process several trends exist in the imperfection patterns. Thus, guidelines are developed that improve imperfection‐modeling assumptions in bucking‐strength analyses.

AB - The design of stiffened cylinders under load combinations that may cause buckling is often based on semi‐empirical “knockdown” factors, which relate the strength of an imperfect structure to the critical load of a perfect shell. This approach can be complemented by analyses that use general computer codes, taking account of both material and geometric nonlinearities. In this case, it is necessary to model in detail initial imperfections, which greatly influence strength predictions. This paper combines nonlinear finite element buckling‐strength analysis with the results of a statistical analysis on experimentally measured imperfections. Simulation methods are employed to estimate probabilistic imperfection properties, which are used to create a number of characteristic models required for strength analysis. It is shown that, by considering the variability and correlation of the parameters describing imperfections, simple rules can be established that clarify imperfection modeling in the finite element analysis of stringer‐stiffened cylinders under axial compression. Finally, the imperfection sensitivity of a particular geometry is studied parametrically, thus demonstrating the potential of imperfection surveys in shell structures.

AB - This paper describes a computer‐based method designed to analyze corrosion‐damaged reinforced concrete elements for repair. The strength, ductility, and stress distribution before and after repair can be estimated. The tensile stress and cracking induced by restrained shrinkage in the repaired structural member can be predicted during hardening, curing, and aging of the repair material. Repair strategies including the need for temporary supports, the addition of reinforcing steel and the selection of repair materials and methods can be considered using the criteria of safety and repair quality. This paper models some repair materials that are available in the market. The results of the analyses indicate that it is important to evaluate material properties such as free shrinkage strain, creep coefficient, and modulus of elasticity at an early age. The computer predictions are corroborated in full‐scale laboratory trials.

AB - In base‐isolated structures specially designed isolation systems provide the needed flexibility and energy dissipation capacity. The isolation systems, which can be either elastomeric or sliding systems, exhibit highly nonlinear behavior. The existing algorithms cannot analyze base‐isolated structures with sliding isolation systems accurately. This paper presents an analytical model and a solution algorithm developed for nonlinear dynamic analysis of three‐dimensional‐base‐isolated structures with elastomeric and/or sliding isolation systems. The novelty of the analytical model and solution algorithm is its capability to capture the highly nonlinear frictional behavior of sliding isolation systems in plane motion. Nonlinear behavior is restricted to the base and the superstructure is considered to be elastic at all times. Biaxial and uniaxial models, which can represent both elastomeric and sliding isolation bearings, are presented. The solution algorithm consisting of the pseudoforce method with iteration is presented. Comparison of computed results with experimental results is presented for verification. A six‐story‐reinforced‐concrete‐base‐isolated structure is analyzed.

AB - This paper discusses the widely accepted seismic design limit state philosophy and the serviceability limit state requirements for stress and drift controls in the 1988 UBC. The limit state philosophy implemented in the UBC is compared with that in the Japanese code. Although the service (or moderate) design earthquake is explicitly specified in the Japanese code, this design earthquake is indirectly assumed in the UBC by specifying a drift limit that is inversely proportional to the Rw factor. The study shows that UBC cannot control the level of stress in steel building structures for service design earthquakes; the allowable seismic stress implied by UBC was found to be too high for ductile structures and too low for structures of limited ductility. The UBC story drift limit of 0.04/Rw (or 0.03/Rw may be too high, and the drift limit of 0.005 (or 0.004) is too conservative for buildings with low Rw values.

AB - A method for large deformation and stability analysis of elastic space frames is presented. The method is based on an Eulerian formulation, which takes into consideration the effects of large joint translations and rotations. Local member force‐deformation relationships are based on the beam‐column approach, and the changes in member chord lengths caused by axial strain and flexural bowing are taken into account. The effect of axial force on member torsional stiffness is included in the analysis. The method employs an orthogonal joint rotation matrix to determine the orientation matrices of the joints in the deformed configuration of the structure. A procedure for determining the deformed orientations of joints and members of space frames is described in detail, and the computational aspects of the analytical procedure, with emphasis on the advantages and limitations of some simplifying approximations, are examined. Numerical solutions are presented for four structures, which indicate that the method of analysis is highly accurate in predicting large deformation responses of structures.

AB - A general formulation using the generalized geometric programming (GGP) technique is presented for the optimum design of unstiffened and stiffened composite hybrid plate girders. It is based on the load factor design method of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standard specification for highway bridges. A mathematical formulation is developed for the optimization of the composite hybrid plate girder problem, using the weight of the girder as the objective function and the section properties and strengths for the problem constraints. The independent and dependent variables are defined for the optimization problem, and the design constraints are formulated in both equality and inequality forms. The nonlinear objective function and the nonlinear design constraints are expressed in suitable form for application of the GGP technique to find the optimum design. A computer program is written in FORTRAN 77 to implement the design procedure, and examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the mathematical model.

A 175‐ft (53.34‐m) long, open‐deck, single‐track, riveted steel through truss railroad bridge is used in this study. The rail irregularities on the approaches and bridge are generated from the power spectral density functions for Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) class 4 and class 6 tracks, respectively. Impact percentages in the critical members of the bridge due to a three, 100‐ton (where 1ton×8.9kN) freight car train operating at 50 mph (80.45 km/hr) are calculated. These impact percentages are compared with the results of the previous study and the values specified by the American Railway Engineering Association (AREA).

AB - Because integral‐abutment bridges decrease the initial and maintenance costs of bridges, they provide an attractive alternative for bridge designers. The objective of this project is to develop rational and experimentally verified design recommendations for piles in these bridges. Field testing consists of instrumenting two bridges in Iowa to monitor air and bridge temperatures, bridge displacements, and pile strains. Core samples are also collected to determine coefficients of thermal expansion for the two bridges. Design values for the coefficient of thermal expansion of concrete and revised temperature ranges for the deck and girders of steel and concrete bridges are recommended. A girder extension model is developed to predict the longitudinal bridge displacements caused by changing bridge temperatures. The pile is idealized as an equivalent cantilever. The frame model better predicts both the longitudinal displacement and weak‐axis pile strains. A lateral frame model is presented to predict the lateral motion of skewed bridges. Two alternatives for the pile design are reviewed: the first alternative, the more conservative, includes thermally induced stresses; the second neglects thermally induced stresses but allows for inelastic redistribution of forces.

AB - A field experiment to investigate the response of buried pipelines to lateral offsets and to traveling wave effects is currently being operated at a test site on a trace of the San Andreas Fault in central California. The experiment is located near Parkfield, California, where the U.S. Geological Survey has predicted the recurrence of a moderate earthquake within the next few years. The goal of the experiment is to develop data that can be used to qualify design and analysis methods for pipelines in seismically active areas. Welded steel and ductile iron pipeline segments are buried and instrumented adjacent to an array of survey monuments and strong motion seismographs. Although the predicted moderate earthquake on the Parkfield‐Cholame segment of the San Andreas Fault has not yet occurred, data obtained during low‐intensity shaking from the surface wave phase of the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake yields valuable insight into pipeline response. Close correlation is found between ground strains induced by surface wave propagation and the transient pipeline strains; coseismic lateral offset also correlates well with residual pipeline strains.

AB - A computational procedure based on the principle of superposition to estimate creep strains in composite masonry walls is developed and presented in this paper. This development is based on the assumption that creep‐versus‐time relationship in masonry can be uniquely defined by a specific creep‐ (i.e., creep per unit stress) versus‐time curve. Experimentally obtained, specific creep‐versus‐time curves for various components of composite masonry walls subjected to uniaxial compressive loads are utilized to establish relationships between the components of creep strain increments and existing stresses. These relationships are used in conjunction with the principle of superposition to compute creep strains in composite masonry walls. In addition, the effect of creep strains on stress changes is also investigated. It is shown that all strains do increase substantially due to creep during the first 300 days, most of these during the first month after load application. On the other hand, the shear stresses in the collar joint remain almost constant with the lapse of time.

AB - Masonry buildings have been, and remain, a popular form for economically enclosing space. Whereas such buildings are safe under gravity loads, most are vulnerable to horizontal loads due to earthquakes. Observations following an earthquake and experimental programs have shown that piers between openings are the most vulnerable part of a masonry building, and that the failure of such piers is due in the majority of cases to shear (or diagonal tension). Accordingly, the study described concerns the seismic response of reinforced masonry piers that exhibit a shear mode of failure. The study consists of two parts. First the results of an experimental program on reinforced masonry piers under cyclic lateral loads simulating seismic excitation are presented. Then several code provisions governing the seismic design of masonry are evaluated in view of the experimental observations, and a new seismic shear design concept is proposed for reinforced masonry piers and walls where the design strength is defined as the onset of diagonal web cracking. Shear reinforcement is considered as a mechanical component that provides postcracking ductility. Validity of the proposed concept is verified by comparing the computed design parameters with the available experimental data.
