AB - The aim of this study is to predict the amount of energy dissipated in a statically determinate steel beam due to material hysteresis. The case considered is that of a simply supported beam with a centrally applied point load. For any given central‐deflection limit history, an analysis is made to determine the load‐deformation response. The structural response is built up from the sectional response, which, in turn, is built up from the material response, i.e., a discrete element approach is implemented. This approach allows an in‐depth assessment of the stress and strain distributions at sections in the critical regions. Numerical integration is used to determine the cumulative area within the load‐deflection hysteresis curves, i.e., the energy dissipated. A full‐scale beam test is performed to provide a comparison with theoretical estimates of energy dissipation. These theoretical predictions are derived using a variety of cyclic stress‐strain models as input.

AB - The aim of this study is to predict the amount of energy dissipated in a statically indeterminate steel beam due to material hysteresis. The case considered is that of a fixed‐end beam subjected to a pseudorandom cyclic deflection history at its third point. The program to conduct this analysis predicts the load response to any pseudorandom deflection limit history, rather than being limited to the constant limit conditions considered previously by other researchers. Three deflection limit histories are considered. The load‐deformation response is built up from the sectional response, which, in turn, is built up from the material response (i.e. a discrete element approach is implemented). This approach allows an in‐depth assessment of the stress and strain distributions at sections in the critical regions. Numerical integration is used to determine the cumulative area within the load‐deflection hysteresis curves (i.e., the energy dissipated).

AB - This paper demonstrates the effect of dead loads on the dynamic response of a uniform elastic rectangular plate and clarifies the physical factors governing the effect. First of all, the governing equation of plates, which includes the effect of dead loads, is formulated by considering the strain energy produced by conservative initial bending stresses due to dead loads. Next, an approximate solution for dynamic deflections of simply supported plates that include the effect of dead loads is presented in closed form. The proposed solution shows strong agreement with numerical results obtained using the Galerkin method. Numerical results show that dynamic displacements and stress couples produced by dynamic live loads decrease on a plate with heavyweight dead loads by considering the effect of dead loads. The reduction is given by kw a being a function of the intensity of dead loads and the thickness, span length, and bending rigidity of the plate. Finally, a method that reflects the effect of dead loads on dynamic live loads is presented by an example.

AB - The effective strength of “square‐and‐diagonal” double‐layer grids constructed by a bolted jointing system is derived in this paper; and is defined as the strength represented in terms of the stress resultants in a continuum plate and determined by periodic modes of elastic buckling under a uniform stress state without an overall buckling deformation. The effective bending strength of the grid is derived under the equivalent stress state M11=M22; M12=M21=0, which is the only stress state for the pin‐jointed case. Because of the existence of joints sizes and connecting rigidities in actual nodes, the effect of them on the effective strength is quantitatively investigated. The effect of web members on the effective strength is also investigated. Furthermore, the effective strength is compared with the strength estimated from the elastic buckling load obtained by a discrete element method for numerical examples.

AB - The paper presents a theoretical analysis of fixed‐ended composite steel‐concrete beams, representative of members continuous over an internal support. The analysis is elastic, and allows for the variation of sagging and hogging bending along the member. The stress resultants obtained from the virtual work analysis are used for an extensive finite element study of lateral‐distortional buckling of fixed‐ended composite beams. The details of the computer program adopted are described elsewhere. Based on the elastic buckling solutions, a design method is proposed to calculate the strength of the composite beam with respect to the buckling limit state. This design method is less conservative than that implied in current design codes, and leads to economies of material. The analysis for continuous composite beams provides a benchmark study for future studies.

AB - A submarine pipeline is idealized as a linearly elastic continuous beam subjected to vertical loads, and supported on a discretized frictionless seafloor profile. The structural analysis of this beam is considered as a unilateral contact problem. This paper presents two analytic solutions for the analysis problem under the small displacement assumption, by using the flexibility and stiffness approaches, respectively. These two approaches lead to alternative formulations of the problem as a linear complementarity problem, which is equivalent to a pair of dual quadratic programming problems. A numerical example shows that the flexibility and stiffness formulations yield the same results. In general, the stiffness formulation requires less effort in the data preparation, while the flexibility formulation is computationally more efficient. These two formulations can also be used for the analysis of unilaterally supported continuous beams subjected to various types of vertical loads. The effect of material nonlinearity can be included in the present formulations without difficulty.

AB - Conventional approaches to the design and analysis of steel frames commonly assume the structure to be of either simple or rigid construction. In the simple construction approach, connections between members are not capable of transmitting moment, whereas in the rigid construction approach, full rotational continuity is provided. In practice, however, most connections are semirigid—possessing some degree of rotational stiffness as a function of the applied load. A method for the nonlinear analysis of space frames incorporating the effect of flexible or semirigid joints is presented. A two‐node zero length connection element with three rotational degrees of freedom per node is used to model the joint. The connection element may be introduced at one or both ends of a general thin‐walled beam‐column element, via kinematic transformation and static condensation. The proposed connection element may be represented by any set of nonlinear coupled or uncoupled, in‐plane, out‐of‐plane, and torsional moment‐rotation relationships. Several numerical examples are presented, which show that the response of a flexibly jointed frame is very sensitive to joint behavior.

AB - Based on the approximate Jezek's method of beam‐column theory, a computerized analysis was performed to determine the maximum strength of cold‐formed steel columns. In this study, the effect of residual stress and initial imperfection on the column strength were taken directly into account in the analysis. In addition, the influence of residual stress on the local buckling strength of the cold‐formed sections also was accounted for by using a new concept, called second reduction. The predicted column strengths were compared with the results of 104 column tests by previous researchers. From the results of the analysis, this study obtained a new column‐strength curve for predicting the maximum strength of cold‐formed steel columns. The predicted values showed good agreement with the test results.

AB - A 780‐m long, very slender cable‐stayed highway bridge is designed for extreme wind speeds and high turbulence intensities. An investigation is made for the service state as well as the ultimate limit state through the mathematical modeling of turbulent wind in space and time. Wind‐force characteristics of the deck cross‐section are adopted from the results of static section model tests. For the ultimate limit state, effects of nonlinear theory, nonlinear stress‐strain relations, and force interactions are considered. The results are evaluated statistically. Significant savings are achieved by the direct calculation of the ultimate limit state as compared with the linear interpolation from the service state. Further research is required in the area of the coherence properties of strong winds; the existing literature appears to provide insufficient documentation for these at the present time.

AB - A new solution procedure is presented, based on the arc‐length method, for passing limit points (load or displacement peaks) in nonlinear finite element analysis of structures. In addition to the usual equilibrium equations, a quadratic arc‐length constraint equation is specified so that the nonlinear solution is sought on a small ellipsoidal surface in load‐deflection space. The main new feature of the proposed procedure is the resolution of the out‐of‐balance loads into a parallel and an orthogonal component with respect to the vector of applied external loads. Methods for avoiding complex roots to the quadratic constraint equation, and for selecting the appropriate root, are presented. Applications of the proposed procedure to two reinforced concrete problems give satisfactory results. The method is effective and versatile in handling both snap‐through and snap‐back problems.

AB - The technique of prestressing has been used successfully to improve the performance of existing concrete structures. However, very few applications of this technique can be found in steel structures. Prestressing by means of high‐strength cable or bar can be used to effectively increase the working load and the ultimate capacity of composite steel‐concrete girders. The benefits of prestressing the steel wide flange section in composite construction can be achieved in strengthening of existing structures as well as in the design of new structures. In this paper, the elastic behavior of continuous, prestressed, composite girders with straight and draped tendon profiles is examined. The effects of design variables such as the prestress force, tendon eccentricity, and tendon length on the working load and deflection of girders are studied. The results show that the allowable load of girder increases proportionally with increase in prestress force and eccentricity. The effect of load pattern on the change in tendon force is also examined. Different prestressing sequences and resulting moments are discussed. A design example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of prestressing for strengthening of girders in existing composite‐steel concrete bridges.

AB - The results of a comprehensive three‐dimensional dynamic analysis of structurally asymmetric high‐rise buildings subjected to stochastic wind forces are summarized. Random vibration theory is used to obtain the response statistics that are important for checking the serviceability of the building. Surface pressures measured in wind‐tunnel tests are analyzed to determine the spectra and cross spectra among the force components. The effects on building response of eccentricities in centers of rigidity and/or mass' and of the correlation among the force components are examined. A simple approach is proposed that could be used at the preliminary design stage to assess potential building vibration problems and to identify situations that warrant a more comprehensive treatment.

AB - In this work we describe an approach to parameter estimation of complex linear structures that we call the mutual residual energy approach. We have endeavored to develop a unified approach to the discrete inverse problems describing static equilibrium and free, undamped vibration, with a particular view toward evolving methods that are amenable to large‐scale computation. The mutual residual energy method is based on the assumption that the topology and geometry of the structure are known, and that the system matrices can be linearly parameterized in terms of kernel matrices that have a solid physical basis and are easy to assemble. Measured motions of the structure and used (in conjunction with measured loads for the static case) to make estimates of the constitutive parameters. The method is based on a particular statement of the principle of virtual work and yields equations for estimating stiffness and mass parameters of linear structures. A condensation procedure is presented to deal with the case of incompletely measured systems. The quantity and quality of response measurements required, the consequences of noisy data, and the choice of load form are among the issues important to the success of our parameter estimation scheme. A numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the features of the method.

AB - Despite advances in the computer analysis of frame buildings for lateral loads, there remains a need for simple models that provide accurate estimates of response. The concept of lateral stiffness is reviewed, and it is concluded that a single value can be used to represent the stiffness of a story in an elastic, rectangular frame with fixed base that is subjected to regular distributions of lateral load. Three existing expressions for approximating the lateral stiffness of stories are compared, but it is concluded that these are applicable only for uniform frames with girders that are flexurally stiffer than columns. An expression is proposed that includes three numerically derived factors that greatly improve the accuracy of stiffness estimates for regular and moderately irregular frames. The proposed expression simulates: (1) The effect of unequal heights for adjacent stories; (2) the influence of top and bottom boundaries; and (3) the stiffening effect of the fixed base in low‐rise frames.

AB - A refined method is presented for evaluating the impulsive components of response of upright, cylindrical liquid‐storage tanks that are supported through a rigid circular foundation at the surface of a homogeneous, elastic half‐space and are excited horizontally at the base. The convcctive components of response are insensitive to the flexibilities of the tank wall and supporting soils, and may be computed considering both the tank and the supporting medium to be rigid. Critical responses are evaluated for harmonic and seismic excitations over wide ranges of tank proportions and soil stiffnesses, and the results are used to elucidate the effects of soil‐structure interaction and to assess the adequacy of a previously reported simpler method. In addition to the exact method, an approximate technique is proposed with which the contributions of the higher modes may be evaluated readily. It is shown that soil‐structure interaction may reduce significantly the critical responses of broad tanks, but may increase those of tall, stiff tanks that have high fundamental natural frequencies. It is further shown that for tanks with height‐to‐radius ratios of the order of 1.5 or less, the higher modes of vibration are insignificant contributors to the overall response. Such systems may be analyzed reliably by the previously proposed simpler method.

AB - In October 1990, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) adopted Guide Specifications for the Seismic Isolation Design of Highway Bridges. This paper overviews the basic concepts and design principles of seismic isolation and discusses the objectives and philosophy of the provisions. A summary of the provisions is presented, and the paper concludes with a procedure to compare the performance of isolation systems with different damping values.

AB - This paper deals with the effect of drying as a moisture diffusion process in a segment of a typical box‐girder bridge. Pore relative humidity distributions throughout the cross sections of the plates of the girder are calculated from the diffusion equation, taking its nonlinearity and aging into account. The effect of creep with aging on the stresses produced by drying shrinkage is taken into account assuming a creep law based on the principle of superposition and described by an aging spring‐dashpot chain model. The cross effects between creep and drying, expressed as stress‐induced shrinkage (equivalent to drying creep), are considered. Tensile strain softening (smeared cracking) is taken into account in the form of an additive cracking strain. Localization of cracking and energetic fracture‐mechanics aspects are neglected. A general algorithm for step‐by‐step integration in time is presented and verified by a convergence study. An example of analysis of the cross section of one recently built bridge confirms the feasibility of the analysis and indicates that the effect of the diffusion process of drying on the stress distributions is very large, in fact, so large that the stress values obtained by customary methods are merely fictitious.

AB - Formulas of fixed-end moments and thrusts for a curved member of constant section subjected to a uniformly distributed in-plane load are presented. Expressions are derived for noncircular curved beams of cycloidal, catenary elliptic, and sine shapes. For curved beams of circular and parabolic shapes, expressions can be found from the works of Parcel and Moorman, and Leontovich. Given a curved beam with the known beam-height-to-span ratio and loading, the fixed-end moments and thrusts can be obtained from the derived expressions. Finally, with some modifications, the present investigation can be applied to curved beams of variable moment of inertia.
