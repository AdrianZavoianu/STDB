AB - A differential equation capable of describing the full‐slip to no‐slip friction transition along a fractured wire in a parallel‐wire strand experiencing external hydrostatic pressure, by prestressed wrapping or intermittent cable bands, has been developed. The model is based on a modified version of a previously reported theoretical work in conjunction with well‐established results in the field of contact‐stress theory. With some reasonable simplifying assumptions, closed‐form solutions to the differential equation have been obtained that provide simple means of estimating the wire‐recovery (or development) length. Recovery length is defined as the length measured from the fractured end of the wire, in which the wire will be able to carry its appropriate share of the axial load. The theory has been developed for an idealized cable, and possible practical limitations of the model have been critically addressed. The present findings should prove useful as a first step toward the development of appropriate discard criteria for parallel wire cables used in, for example, suspension bridges.

AB - The effects of inelastic buckling on monotonic and cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel bars are studied. Experimental tests show that this phenomenon occurs when the ratio between length and diameter of the bar exceeds 5, and that it leads to a postyield softening branch in compression that strongly influences the cyclic behavior of the bar. An analytical model of rebars accounting for inelastic buckling is presented, suitable for inclusion in programs for the analysis of r/c sections using the fiber type of discretization. The model employs four hardening rules (kinematic, isotropic, memory, and saturation) as functions of four independent parameters (yield stress, elastic modulus, hardening ratio, and a weighing coefficient). An explicit stress‐strain relation in finite terms for loading branches is utilized. The model yields accurate results in predicting the cyclic behavior of rebars, both with and without inelastic buckling, for deformation paths of general nature.

AB - The use of tuned mass dampers (TMDs) to reduce the vibrations of single‐degree‐of‐freedom systems with uncertain properties subjected to white‐noise random excitation is considered. The uncertainties of the system are modeled as random variables and are assumed to be time‐independent. The statistics of the system response are found by using a second‐order Taylor expansion or numerical integration methods. Using these methods and an optimization software the optimum design parameters of the TMD are computed. Validation calculations show that Taylor expansion can predict the system response for low and moderate levels of uncertainty in the system properties. It is found that parameter uncertainties may have a significant effect on the TMD efficiency. Finally, it is recommended that the “probabilistic tuning” approach described in this paper be used whenever there is a significant uncertainty in the system properties.

AB - Corrugated‐metal box culverts are employed as replacements for short‐span bridges. As a result of increasing use, there is a great demand for establishing a rational design procedure for these culverts. The available design procedures are based on experience or mathematical modeling. Only a limited number of attempts have been made to verify these design techniques with full‐scale field tests. Three corrugated‐metal box culverts were fully instrumented and field‐tested under similar backfill conditions and live loads. The first culvert was bulb‐angle‐rib‐reinforced corrugated aluminum; the second was rib‐reinforced corrugated steel; and the third was corrugated‐rib‐reinforced corrugated steel. The collected data were evaluated using a finite element analysis, and the applicability of standard design parameters was determined. Maximum bending moments obtained from field tests were compared to plastic moments calculated according to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) specifications. It was concluded that the design for these types of structures can be improved if (1) Composite action is assumed; (2) thrust forces are included in design; and (3) construction procedures are controlled. The AASHTO specifications were conservative for rib‐reinforced, corrugated‐metal culverts.

AB - This specification covers the design of composite and noncomposite beams with web openings. The specification follows load and resistance factor design (LRFD) philosophy, and may be adopted as a chapter in a larger specification. Basic design procedures involve determination of maximum nominal flexural capacity, maximum nominal shear capacity, and interaction of flexure and shear. The maximum nominal flexural capacity is calculated using standard strength procedures for both composite and noncomposite sections, taking into account the loss of material within the web. The maximum nominal shear capacity is based on a simplified four‐hinge mechanism, with one hinge at each corner of the opening. The general design approach is identical for composite and noncomposite members, with or without opening reinforcement. The design procedures apply only to compact sections. Additional criteria are applied to ensure ductile behavior and performance in accordance with the design expressions. The procedures apply to both rectangular and circular openings. Criteria for placement of concentrated loads and positioning of openings are included, as are detailing requirements for opening and slab reinforcement.

AB - A three‐dimensional nonlinear finite element model of a light‐frame wood building was created and used to determine internal forces caused by wind pressure in shear walls. Comparing the results with current design procedures led to two fundamental observations: (1) The assumption of current procedures that one‐half of the load is transferred directly to the foundation is correct; (2) calculating internal forces in the shear walls by simple‐ and continuous‐beam models does not reflect the real situation and may lead to erroneous results. Linear and nonlinear models assuming the roof diaphragm as a rigid beam on elastic supports were proposed, analyzed, and compared with the finite element solution of an experimentally verified model. Satisfactory accuracy can be achieved by using the rigid‐beam analogy if the shear stiffness of the walls is known.

AB - This report analyzes the implied reliability of current practice for the design of bolted wood connections. All U.S. data available to the writer were used. The resistance distribution was taken to be normal, and the coefficient of variation was obtained by pooling data from several sources, as long as the moisture condition, grain direction, side‐plate material, and species were alike. The reliability index for softwood connections is about 5; the index for hardwood connections is about 20% greater than that for softwood connections. A comparative study of data from six sources showed that reliability does not depend upon bolt length‐to‐diameter ratio, and the effects of wood moisture content and side‐plate material (steel or wood) are minimal. Two new codes are briefly examined and compared with current practice. Both of these codes contain radically reformed design criteria for bolted wood connections. The comparison shows that both new codes maintain the present level of reliability.

AB - Partially grouted concrete masonry incorporates to some degree the beneficial properties of fully grouted concrete masonry at a reduced cost. It is also an economical and convenient means of improving the limited flexural tensile strength of hollow‐concrete masonry and, hence, a study of flexural tensile strength of partially grouted concrete masonry was considered opportune. Methodology and techniques of one‐third scale direct modeling were used in the study, for which the bond wrench test was used to determine the flexural tensile strength of wall assemblages. A total of 15 model walls were tested to determine the effect of grout spacing on flexural strength for bending normal to bed joints. Formulas were developed, empirically and analytically, for prediction of flexural tensile strength of partially grouted masonry. Test results indicate that flexural tensile strength improves significantly with reduced grout spacing, and that the apparent factor of safety of the ACI‐530/ASCE‐5 code of 1988 varies considerably for different extents of grouting.

AB - Addressing the need to estimate the number of vec heat applications required to repair a specified degree of damage in heat‐straightening operations, an experimental program using steel flat plates under controlled conditions in the laboratory was devised and executed. Recognizing the random nature of the plastic rotation process resulting from heat‐straightcning repairs, simple engineering predictors based on the theory of reliability arc derived consistent with the uniform value of a preselected target risk index. Two different forms of this predictor arc formulated, based on whether or not the principal statistics of the process for the subject plate are known. These models are theoretically verified by a separate model using spectral analysis in the frequency domain. Excellent agreement was obtained among the estimates by the different formulations.

AB - Economical heat‐straightening operations on damaged elements in heavy steel construction require the accurate estimation of the number of heat applications necessary to effect a given repair. An experimental program to provide empirical support to theoretical predictors was devised and executed with the objective of estimating the number of partial‐depth vee heat applications required to repair a specified damage angle in wide‐flange beams. Extending ideas previously implemented for plate elements, simple engineering models based on the theory of reliability were derived using the uniform value of a preselected target reliability index, and theoretically verified with a separate application of spectral analysis in the frequency domain. Parametric studies were conducted to examine the variation of the estimate with the principal statistics of the plastic rotations in the straightening process. Very good agreement was obtained among the estimates using the different formulations.

AB - The impact of six continuous multigirder steel bridges, with overall span lengths ranged from 130 ft to 260 ft (39.62 m to 70.25 m), due to vehicles moving across rough bridge decks is analyzed. Bridges are modeled as grillage beam systems. The vehicle is simulated as a nonlinear vehicle model with 12 degrees of freedom according to the HS20‐44 truck design loading included in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) specifications. Based on International Standards Organization specifications, the road‐surface roughness of the approach roadways and bridge decks is generated from the power spectral density function for very good, good, average, and poor roads. Maximum dynamic responses of the longitudinal girders are evaluated for two trucks (side by side) through changing their transverse positions, with different speeds and road‐surface roughnesses. A comparison between the impact factors calculated by the presented theory and AASHTO impact formula is given. Furthermore, the effect of span length, transverse stiffness, spacing of girders, damping ratio, and others are discussed. The results can be used for the design of continuous multigirder steel bridges and the further study of impact formula proposed by AASHTO specifications.

AB - The effect of moisture content on the reliability of structural wood members is examined, and possible code provisions to account for such effects are presented. Specifically, the effect of assuming one moisture content for design and using the member at a different moisture content is considered. This is of particular interest since one set of design values for a single moisture content classification are likely to be available to the designer. Data from the in-grade test program are used to investigate the effects of different types of uncertainty. This study suggests whether empirical modifications to strength values such as those in current design specifications for wood construction are appropriate for use in a limit-states design format, or whether new adjustment factors based on probabilistic analyses are warranted. The implications for codified design are presented in the context of the ongoing development of load- and resistance-factor design specification for wood construction.

AB - The results of earthquake tests of light-frame, wood shear walls conducted by several researchers are reviewed. The effect of using adhesives to attach the sheathing material to the framing is considered, specifically, potential problems due to the adhesive strengthening and stiffening of the wall system when subjected to an inertial loading such as an earthquake. None of the current design and building codes used in the United States address the use of adhesives, and engineers may design unsafe structures. Change in probable failure modes from the traditional ductile yielding of the nail connections between the sheathing and the framing to the anchorage connections or adjacent structural components is highlighted. Recommendations for changes that should be made to the building and design codes are suggested. Changes to the seismic design procedures only are recommended and the improved performance of adhesives in shear walls subjected to wind or other applied loads is acknowledged.
