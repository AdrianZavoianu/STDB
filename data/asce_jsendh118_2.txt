AB - This paper describes the experimental results of 12 beam‐column joints (five exterior, seven interior) that employ steel‐fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC), under reversed cyclic loading; the experiments were conducted at the Southeast University of China, in Nanjing, China. The parameters studied were the reinforcement ratio of beam bars, the volume ratio of the stirrups in the joint core, and the development length of the beam bar in the joint. Test results indicated that SFRC increases joint shear strength, as well as better ductility and better energy‐dissipation capacities. SFRC used in the joint core could reduce congestion in the steel reinforcement and ease construction difficulties. The joint with steel fibers had a better bond and improved the anchorage properties of the bar. This study suggests that the use of SFRC in beam‐column joints may be applied to structures in seismic areas. In this paper, a formula for joint shear strength and design recommendations are presented for SFRC structures.

AB - The paper presents the findings of field studies into impactive loading generated by trains on a prestressed‐concrete‐girder bridge. The studies were conducted on Denison Creek bridge, in Central Queensland, Australia, which comprises simply supported spans of varying length and carries a single ballasted track of continuously welded rail on prestressed concrete sleepers. Bridge traffic is almost exclusively heavy‐haul coal trains. Various defects were cut into one rail to model real defects such as wheel flats, wheel burns on rails, and broken or misaligned rails, Impacts from trains were measured via two independent strain‐gage systems, with readings taken at the girder soffits. The heavy‐haul coal traffic provided regular passages of long trains with axle loads known from mine weighings. The paper includes data on loading and number of wagons or locomotives involved in each sample for which impact data are presented. The strain readings quantify the variation of impact with degree of rail defect and also show that impacts may often exceed code values. The paper discusses the implications for bridge design.

AB - In long suspension bridges with a small span ratio of side to center, cable slip load against the saddle is large and it is important to grasp its frictional resistance in the design. An experimental investigation is done using a test device that simulates the state in a real bridge. As a result, it is made clear that the frictional coefficient in the case of a saddle surface coated with inorganic zinc‐rich primer is 0.31, and that zinc‐metallized is 0.60. And slip behavior of cable is clear as follows: (1) The slip starts at a relatively small value of the frictional coefficient, but even after slip starts, the frictional resistance grows, and after a maximum value is reached, the decline is gradual; (2) a fractional slip continues even after the slip load is held constant, and it takes a considerably long time for the slip to cease; and (3) the bolt‐tightening force for increasing frictional resistance declines considerably after tightening the bolt.

AB - This paper presents properties of fire‐resistant (FR) steel for structural use. Because of the elements contained and its rolling process, FR steel retains strength at high temperatures compared with conventional structural steels for buildings. Through mechanical‐properties tests at high temperatures and full‐scale fire tests of load‐bearing members, it is confirmed that FR steel can bear a load corresponding to the allowable stress for structural steel under permanent loading (which is two‐thirds of the room temperature yield point) at 600° C. Also, applications of FR steel to buildings are presented. Through these tests and applications, it is confirmed that FR steel can reduce fire protection compared with conventional structural steels and can also be used in steel buildings without any protection in cases where the steel temperature would not exceed 600° C.

AB - Two simplified methods for second‐order inelastic analysis of steel frames, termed the modified plastic‐hinge and the beam‐column strength approaches, are presented. These analysis models are comparable to elastic‐plastic‐hinge analysis in efficiency, and yet, they alleviate the problems associated with overprediction of stiffness and strength by the usual elastic‐plastic‐hinge analysis methods. The modified plastic‐hinge method is based on simple modifications to the elastic‐plastic‐hinge model, which account for the degradation in stiffness as the cross‐section strength is approached at critical locations along the member length. The beam‐column strength method is similar to the modified plastic‐hinge approach, except that in this model, equations for the strength of the overall member are employed rather than expressions for the cross‐section strength. The performance of these analysis models is contrasted with results from elastie‐plastic‐hinge and refined plastic‐zone analysis solutions as well as results from experimental tests. Recommendations are provided with regard to the acceptability of simplified analysis models for use in predicting inelastic load‐deflection behavior and maximum strength.

AB - A wind‐tunnel study is conducted to assess wind loads on buildings with sawtooth roofs. Local and area‐averaged pressure coefficients are measured on models with one, two, and four spans. The roof angle is 15° in all cases. In most regions of the roof, critical values of mean and peak suction obtained with the double‐span and multispan models are similar in magnitude to data obtained with the single‐span model. However, pressure data measured near the roof edge in the trough of the double‐span and multispan models are more than 50% larger than corresponding data obtained with the single‐span model. Positive pressures measured on walls of the sawtooth models are similar in magnitude to those obtained with the monosloped roof model. However, positive pressures measured in the trough region of the sawtooth roof are significantly larger than corresponding data for the monosloped roof. Local pressure data obtained in the present study are compared with design pressures for sawtooth buildings specified in the Australian standard. Peak suctions and positive pressures are generally larger than the values given in the Australian standard.

AB - Yield safety is introduced as a variable that controls both the cracking under service conditions and the permissible redistribution of ductile structural concrete frameworks at the ultimate limit state. Limiting values of the yield safety that ensure satisfaction of the code‐specified cracking criteria are derived from the results of a comprehensive computer investigation. A parametric study of the yield‐safety factor against cracking identifies the reinforcing index, ω, the allowable crack width, wa (or concrete tensile strength fr), and the degree of prestressing, γ, as the governing factors in cracking control. These factors, along with the live‐to‐total service load ratio, WL/W, which affects the overall safety of the structure, determine the permissible moment redistribution of concrete frameworks. Numerical examples of design (with concurrent satisfaction of the ultimate and serviceability limit states) and analysis of cracking serviceability criteria, in agreement with ACI 318‐89 code requirements, illustrate the application of the concepts presented.

AB - A relatively simple rigid plastic model for evaluating the seismic displacement of rigid retaining walls resting in dry cohesionless soils is presented. The wall displacement caused by both the sliding and tilting modes of deformation is obtained in a coupled manner. The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated using sinusoidal and real earthquake excitations. Wall displacements computed ignoring the tilting mode of deformation can be substantially lower than those computed incorporating it. Results of a parametric study show that the wall response can be influenced by the wall friction, the frequency of excitation, and the vertical component of excitation.

AB - Utility requirements can often dictate the use of openings in prestressed concrete beams and girders. Such provision of openings minimizes headroom and thus, leads to economy. In this paper the nonlinear analysis and design of statically loaded simply supported posttensioned prestressed concrete beams and girders with rectangular openings are presented. Several design parameters are varied such as: opening length and depth, vertical and horizontal locations of the opening, location of the applied load, type of cross section, and opening reinforcement. The results from the analytical study are substantiated by test results from 12 posttensioned prestressed concrete beams, eight of which are rectangular in section, the remaining four are of T‐section. Good agreement is shown between the theoretical and experimental results. A rational method of distributing the shear between the top and bottom chords of the opening is proposed, together with a design procedure against cracking of such chords. An illustrated design example is presented.

AB - The process of designing a typical simply supported girder for service loads is well established. However, the fact that the girder will be suspended by cables during the erection phase affects the safety of the girder. Initial camber, such as in the case of prestressed concrete girders, aggravates the problem. The presence of camber causes the resultant of the load to be located above the center of torsion of the member, thus causing an increase in torsional moment with increasing lateral displacement. This behavior reduces the critical buckling load of the member and the safety of the girder. This paper presents the differential equations necessary to obtain the critical buckling load for a cambered member subjected to its own weight during lifting. Support conditions considered include: (1) Simply supported; (2) suspended by cables at the ends; and (3) suspended by cables located an equal distance from the ends of the member. Finally, sample graphs of the results are included to show the significance of camber in calculating the critical buckling load of a member.

AB - The research reported here is a follow‐up on experimental work in which 16 12 in. (305 mm) square and 9 ft (2.74 m) long columns were tested under flexure to large inelastic deformations while simultaneously subjected to axial load that remained constant throughout the test. The main variables included the distribution of longitudinal and lateral steel, amount of lateral steel, tie spacing, and axial load level. In this paper, the predictions for the behavior of these specimens from the available stress‐strain models for confined concrete are compared with the test results. After a critical examination of the analytical models and the variables that affect the behavior of the specimens, a model originally proposed for concentric compression was modified to include the effects of strain gradient and the level of axial load. As a result of strain gradient, the concrete is able to sustain additional deformation at and beyond the peak stress. The effect of increased axial load is incorporated with reduced concrete strength. A numerical example is presented in which the use of a rectangular stress block representing the actual stress‐strain curve of concrete obtained from the confinement model is demonstrated.

Symmetrical and unsymmetrical arrangements of setbacks are tested. The displacement, acceleration, and shear responses of the setback frames during earthquake simulations are compared with those of seven previously tested frames with uniform profiles. The variation of representative response maxima with base motion intensity and distributions of maximum response over the height of the frames are considered. Setback frames are not observed to be more susceptible to damage or more susceptible to higher‐mode effects than the frames with uniform profiles.

The modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture of sorted groups of select structural Douglas‐fir 2×4 lumber are determined from standard pseudostatic bending tests after the groups are brought into equilibrium with various prescribed environments. Lognormal statistical distributions of strength and stiffness of the various groups are related by evaluating the distribution parameters as quadratic functions of temperature and moisture content. The correlation between modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture, and observed modes of failure, are also presented as they pertain to changes in temperature and moisture content.

AB - Analysis is made of the secondary flexural stresses in the walls of trapezoidal orthotropic steel deck ribs at the top of the floor beam web cutouts. These stresses are due to the transverse expansion of the bottom portions of the ribs caused by the Poisson's ratio effect of compressive longitudinal stress. In combination with primary stresses, they can be an important contributing factor in the development of fatigue cracks. Yet, they have been overlooked in previous investigations. The secondary stress formulas are functions of the primary rib stress and the geometry—width of the rib bottom, rib‐wall thickness, radius of rib corner curvature, and the depth of floor beam cutout. The stress is inversely proportional to the square of the cutout depth, and, therefore, the cutout should be made as deep as practicably possible. Formulas for the maximum values of secondary stresses are illustrated by numerical example. Additional recommendations for minimizing stress raisers at the junction are also made.

AB - A general procedure to construct design charts for rectangular timber columns with prescribed end eccentricities and initial bow is presented. The design charts use the new load and resistance factor design (LRFD) format. These charts can be used to check trail sections or obtain suitable combinations of axial load and moments for a particular section and slenderness ratio. The current design format requires repeated calculations of a series of factors. Values of maximum axial load to factored compressive resistance ratios, and moment-magnification factors for ratios equal to and below maximum can be obtained from a single chart as a function of slenderness ratio alone. Use of design charts is explained for both columns with axial load alone and combined bending and axial load via an example problem, in accordance with the Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code. Similar design charts may be developed to aid designers, reduce computational errors, and save calculation time.

AB - Using strain‐induced orthotropic material concepts, a new numerical constitutive model for predicting the cyclic loading behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) is formulated. A state of plane stress is assumed. The response is considered to be kinematically linear, but it accounts for the nonlinear material behavior. Cyclic‐loading‐induced damage is accommodated. Only the uniaxial compressive strength of the concrete and the yield stress of the reinforcing steel are needed as input to predict both constitutive behavior and structural strength. The approach is simple, reliable, and computationally efficient. The constitutive model is demonstrated by using a finite‐element program to successfully predict the behavior of a highly nonlinear deep beam structure for which experimental test results were obtained from the literature.
