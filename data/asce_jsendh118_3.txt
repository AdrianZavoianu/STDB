AB - Periodic human body motions can lead to excessive structural vibrations. In normal cases, frequency tuning a structure is a useful countermeasure. In special cases, lower structural frequencies than those resulting from the presented frequency‐tuning criteria may be accepted. This is confirmed by experiences with practical cases: Ten case studies of footbridges, gymnasiums and sports halls, dance halls and concert halls without fixed seating, concert halls with fixed seating, and high‐diving platforms are presented. In some cases, existing buildings had to be upgraded. In other cases, where structures were still in the planning stage, significant modifications to the design were necessary.

AB - A large number of tests on a range of cold‐formed square and rectangular hollow sections subjected to pure bending, pure concentrated force and combined bending, and concentrated force are described. The concentrated force is applied by means of a bearing plate that acts across the full flange width of the section. The ratio (γ) of the bearing length to the width of the bearing plate used varies from 0.5 to 1.0 in order to show the effects of the bearing length on the failure loads. The current tests are compared with previous T‐joint tests performed at the University of Sydney on similar sections to demonstrate the significant reductions in failure loads and the more severe interaction between bending moment and concentrated force for the tests using bearing plates. The test results are compared with the existing Australian, European, and American design procedures. Improved design procedures are also proposed.

AB - The paper presents a method of analysis for the short‐term and timedependent response of slender reinforced concrete columns of circular cross section. The columns are assumed to be pin‐ended and loaded with equal end eccentricity. Creep and shrinkage effects are modeled using the age‐adjusted effective modulus method, coupled with a relaxation procedure described elsewhere. Although the analysis assumes linear short‐term material behavior, it is applicable to calculating the nonlinear behavior due to changes in geometry and the effective design strength of circular columns, since the concrete stresses are significantly lower than the cylinder strength at the axial force and moment levels corresponding to the design load‐moment envelope. Based on the computer solutions, a simplified design procedure is proposed that is suitable for routine office application.

AB - In structural reliability under fatigue, the basic event is section failure. It is defined in terms of the time to develop a through‐thickness crack at the critical hot spot in the section. Correction factors account for the fact that the crack may occur at a site other than the critical hot spot and that section failure occurs sometime after development of a through‐thickness crack. After failure, the section is assumed to be “severed.” The branch‐and‐bound algorithm is used to identify important sequences of section failures leading to collapse, and structure failure is approximated as the event that one of these important sequences occurs. Efficient first‐order reliability methods are used for probability computations. The procedure is applied to an offshore platform. Significant systems effects are observed, i.e., the probability of structure collapse is much smaller than the probability of failure of an individual section. The use of inspection observations in updating reliability estimates also is presented.

AB - Fatigue tests on a parallel‐wire large‐diameter cable system for cable‐stayed bridges and a detailed review of other fatigue test results are conducted. As a result, it is made clear that as the diameter of a cable increases, its fatigue strength decreases, stress concentration at the cable anchor portion is the principal factor influencing the fatigue strength of large‐diameter cables within working stress range in fatigue design of cables, and when the cable is grouted with cement for anticorrosion purposes, nongalvanized wires may have their life extremely shortened by corrosion fatigue due to excess water after a chemical reaction, which depends on the quality of material and on the manner of execution. Furthermore, the design S‐N curves, which are based on 5% wire breakage life, are proposed. The results of this study are used for fatigue design of Honshu‐Shikoku railway/highway cable‐stayed bridges, which are constructed over the sea (severely affecting durability) and on which a large repeated load due to railway acts.

AB - This paper presents a rational procedure for determining the strength of wood box columns. The theoretical development takes into account the effects of interlayer slip that is characteristic of layered systems with nonrigid connections. One hundred and fifty box columns are fabricated and tested. Good agreement is observed between experimental results and theory. To study their efficiency, box‐column results are compared with equivalent layered and equivalent solid systems. Effect of number of connectors on the strength of box columns is investigated.

AB - Problems associated with floor vibrations caused by human movements are becoming more prevalent. In this paper tuned mass dampers are used to reduce the excessive vibrations of a long‐span balcony due to spectator‐induced resonance. A three‐dimensional computer model of the system is developed and its main characteristics are established through matching the dynamic properties of the model with the results of a number of dynamic tests. Five pairs of tuned mass dampers are considered to act together to suppress the resonant response of the system. These mass dampers are tuned to the first two natural modes of the structure, which had the highest possibility of excitation. Optimum design parameters of these tuned mass dampers are developed using the equivalent single degree of freedom (SDOF) model. Test data obtained after the installation of tuned mass dampers is used to evaluate their effectiveness for the reduction of the vibration amplitude.

AB - The vibration of floor systems caused by human movements can be reduced using tuned mass dampers. The component mode synthesis (CMS) method is used to compute the response of the floor‐tuned mass damper system using only a few natural modes of the floor. Models representing typical two‐dimensional floor‐system behavior are used to illustrate this technique. Tuning parameters obtained using the CMS method and an equivalent single degree of freedom (SDOF) model to represent the vibration characteristics of a multiple degree of freedom system are compared. It is found that using the CMS method can result in the optimum parameters of the tuned mass dampers regardless of the closeness of the natural frequencies of the system. This is not the case when the equivalent SDOF model is used. Therefore, it is concluded that use of CMS method to represent the model for optimization produces tuned mass damper parameters that provide global reduction in the amplitude of vibration for cases with and without closely spaced modes.

AB - The application of the component mode synthesis (CMS) method to calculate the optimum tuned mass‐damper parameters is extended by adding a number of static mode shapes to the formulation. It is shown that the addition of these modes can result in a better accuracy of the responses. A three‐dimensional floor model is used to illustrate this technique. In addition, the tuning parameters are compared to values found using the customary equivalent single degree of freedom (SDOF) model for optimization. It is shown that when several mass dampers are tuned to a single mode, the equivalent SDOF model for optimization cannot generate the optimum parameters for these tuned mass dampers. It is also found that using the CMS method with the addition of the static mode shape can result in significant reduction in the computational effort for the system response. It is also concluded that when n number of tuned mass dampers are used to reduce the level of vibration of a single mode, the optimality criterion is expected to produce n+1 number of equal peaks in the response curve near that natural frequency.

AB - Dynamic soil‐tank interaction under horizontal seismic excitations has a profound effect on the amplification of hydrodynamic forces and moments exerted on tank structure. Analytical mechanical models for flexible cylindrical tanks, which also account for the effect of rigid‐base rocking motion and lateral translation, are used with a lumped‐parameters idealization of foundation soil. A comprehensive parametric analysis is conducted to study the effects and relative importance of a few factors influencing the seismic response of tank‐liquid‐soil systems. Computer programs are implemented to evaluate the system response to ground earthquake motions. Results are presented in the form of graphs that give engineers a useful tool for understanding the seismic performance of the system and for developing effective design procedures.

AB - Analysis of the behavior of ground‐based tanks under vertical seismic excitations is quite relevant to their seismic‐resistant design as vertical acceleration is transmitted to a horizontal hydrodynamic loading on the tank wall. This effect results primarily in amplified hoop tensile stress and, coupled with the effect of horizontal excitations, may lead to inelastic buckling of the shell. However, to realistically consider the effect of vertical excitations in the design of tanks, one must consider the dynamic interaction of the tank and its content with foundation soil. A simplified analysis is used as the basis for a thorough parametric evaluation of the effects of numerous factors that influence the seismic response of an elastic tank supported on a rigid base (solid concrete slab) and subjected to a vertical excitation, taking into account shell‐liquid‐soil interaction. Results are presented in the form of design graphs that practicing engineers can use to estimate the seismic response of tanks under vertical excitations.

AB - Strength and serviceability limit states are closely interrelated in wood construction. The design of wood beams is often governed by limits on deflection, and the resulting section is larger than that required for flexure or shear strength. Moreover, members used in light‐frame construction are chosen from standard available dimension lumber sizes. Relatively few sizes are available for wood in comparison to the number of standard shapes available in steel construction. As a result, the sections selected in wood design may be significantly larger than what would otherwise be required by the design equations. This paper addresses the additional reliability gained with respect to ultimate strength by including the deflection limit state and by considering the availability of standard sections for individual wood members and parallel‐member systems. The significance of system effects from load sharing in serviceability reliability is assessed. The implications that these effects have for the ongoing development of load and resistance factor design (LRFD) provisions for engineered wood construction are examined.

AB - A new modeling technique for the ultimate strength analysis of welded tubular connections subjected to general loading is presented. Based upon the finite element method, the model includes shell and solid elements, large deformations, and elastoplasticity. Unlike other approaches, the ability to simulate the initiation and propagation of fracture is included through the application of continuum damage mechanics (CDM). With this method, cracking is predicted on the basis of a damage variable, and its effect is applied as a reduction in the element stiffness. The development of the material constants is described and numerical results are obtained for two tubular joints that exhibit fracture failure. A comparison between the computed failure loads and those observed experimentally shows a close correlation. With this approach, welded connections that are subjected to arbitrary loading can be efficiently evaluated for strength.

AB - Roof systems constructed using cold-formed steel components, i.e., C- or Z-shaped purlins and interconnected roof panels, have become a very popular form of construction in the United States. This type of roof system is used extensively for single-story commercial and industrial buildings. The popularity of cold-formed steel purlins and panels is due in part to their superior gravity load strength-to-weight ratio. However, because of their relatively light weight, a cold-formed steel member is very susceptible to the loading resulting from wind uplift. The behavior of roof systems of this type, when subjected to wind uplift, is very complex to define analytically. The design specification in the United States for cold-formed steel construction does not provide a comprehensive analytical solution to the problem of wind uplift strength of a cold-formed steel purlin. Therefore, an easily applied, empirically based design procedure has been developed for evaluating the moment capacity of a cold-formed steel C- or Z-section. The approach is applicable only for a through-fastened roof system, i.e., a roof system for which the roof panel is attached to the purlin by a self-drilling or self-tapping screw.

AB - A method is proposed for dynamic analysis of beams on an elastic foundation. The method develops mass and stiffness matrices of a beam on an elastic foundation finite element from the exact solution of the shape functions governing its end deformations. The developed matrices can be combined with conventional beam element matrices to obtain assembled matrices, which can be used to determine natural frequencies and mode shapes of a general structure. Since the proposed method is based on the exact solution of the related differential equation, the accuracy is independent of element refinement. This is in contrast to other methods in which the accuracy is dependent on the number of elements modeled due to approximate modeling of the elastic foundation as discrete soil springs. The proposed method can be further expanded for forced vibration problems, such as earthquake problems, to determine dynamic response under time varying loads.
