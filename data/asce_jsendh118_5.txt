AB - The energy‐dissipating characteristics of U‐shaped mild steel strips, called U elements, are investigated by subjecting them to a rolling‐bending motion (like that of a bulldozer's tracks). Cycles of such motion are applied to the U elements, obtaining information whereby viscous effects as well as fatique life are determined. Temperature rise during cyclic deformation of the U elements is recorded. A force‐displacement model of the U elements is worked out to facilitate analysis of structures to be equipped with these elements. A prototype of a structural seismic damper consisting of a multiplicity of U elements is constructed and tested, and illustrations are presented regarding possible installations of such dampers in structures. A qualitative model of plastic‐hinge formation in the U elements is proposed to show the difference between perfectly plastic behavior and real behavior.

AB - A new cracking theory is presented for the analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) members subjected to uniaxial tension. The theory is developed on the basis of the (actual) nonlinear bond stress‐slip relationship and of the extensive study of physical behavior. For a comparatively lightly loaded member (CLLM) concrete strain equals steel strain in a central portion of the RC member. For a comparatively heavily loaded member (CHLM) concrete strain is lower than steel strain everywhere in the RC member and attains its maximum value at mid‐span. In a CLLM, the first primary crack can occur at any section located in the aforementioned central portion; in a CHLM, the first primary crack can occur only at the symmetry section. After the first cracking any subsequent crack can form only at the symmetry section, contrary to the current opinion. The expressions for predicting the primary crack formation, crack spacing and width, as well as the tension‐stiffening effect are provided. The accuracy of the analytical solution is shown by comparison with available experimental results. The complete agreement shows the reliability of the cracking theory presented.

AB - The existing problems with the finite element analysis of tall buildings are reviewed. It is found that: (1) many different definitions have been used for the nodal rotations, but only defining them as rotations of vertical fibers is really appropriate; (2) most simple elements are afflicted by the presence of parasitic shear, while strain function formulation provides a good means of solving the problem; and (3) the incorporation of some commonly accepted assumptions can substantially improve the computational efficiency of the method. Based on these observations, a new strain‐based plane stress element with rotational degrees of freedom defined as vertical fiber rotations is developed. The element is free of parasitic shear and converges so quickly that it can be used at a rate of only one layer per story. If implemented in conjunction with the assumption that the distortion of the sectional shape of the wall system is negligible, the proposed method is computationally as efficient as the frame method.

AB - The results of a large‐scale experimental study on fabricated tubular steel members are presented. Twenty‐two specimens with a diameter of 450 mm and lengths varying between 1.5 and 10 m are fabricated and tested under various combinations of axial load and bending moment. Wall thicknesses vary between 4.5 and 8.8 mm, and the measured yield stress varies between 250 and 450 MPa, resulting in specimens with a cross‐sectional slenderness factor of α=Et/FyD of approximately 7.5 and 9.0; respectively. Laboratory measurements of weld‐induced residual strains and surface geometry of specimens before testing are examined in conjunction with observed behavior and are related to failure modes. The load‐deflection behavior up to and beyond ultimate load is studied, and test results are compared with existing and proposed design rules with respect to local buckling, strength, and stability interaction. Good agreement with stability modeling is seen, and observed differences with strength interaction equations are discussed. Recommendations are made pertaining to the strength calculations of tubulars in the intermediate section slenderness category where local buckling limits the strength between first yield and full plastification.

AB - Optimizing most structural systems used in practice requires considering design variables as discrete quantities. The paper presents a simple genetic algorithm for optimizing structural systems with discrete design variables. As genetic algorithms (GAs) are best suited for unconstrained optimization problems, it is necessary to transform the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. A penalty‐based transformation method is used in the present work. The penalty parameter depends on the degree of constraint violation, which is found to be wellsuited for a parallel search using genetic algorithms. The concept of optimization using the genetic algorithm is presented in detail using a three‐bar truss problem. All the computations for three successive generations are presented in the form of tables for easy understanding of the algorithm. Two standard problems from literature are solved and results compared. The application of the genetic algorithm to design optimization of a larger problem is illustrated using a 160‐bar transmission tower.

AB - The seismic input energy imparted to a structure is dissipated by hysteretic behavior and other nonyielding mechanisms usually represented by equivalent viscous damping. It is generally recognized that there is a strong correlation between the energy dissipated by hysteretic action and the seismically induced level of damage. While viscous damping has a small effect on the amount of energy imparted to a structure, it has a significant influence on the amount of hysteretic energy dissipation. A parametric study is presented on the influence of the mathematical modeling of viscous damping on seismic‐energy dissipation of multidegree‐of‐freedom (MDOF) structures. The damping is modeled using mass‐proportional, stiffness‐proportional, and Rayleigh damping computed from either the initial elastic or the tangent inelastic system properties. Various structural performance indices are evaluated for bilinear hysteresis model of simple MDOF structures with different strength levels, strain hardening ratios, and damping ratios.

AB - High strength, low weight, corrosion resistance, and electromagnetic neutrality make fiber‐reinforced plastic (FRP) a suitable candidate in many structural applications, including rehabilitation and strengthening as well as the development of new wood members. Advanced forms of reinforced wood construction can enable contemporary wood structures to play an even greater role in today's construction. In this work, the writers establish a novel technique for reinforcing wood members involving external bonding of pretensioned FRP sheets on their tension zones. An analytical model for the maximum initial pretension is verified with tests on carbon/epoxy‐prestressed wood beams. Additional studies, both analytical and experimental of the flexural behavior of wood beams reinforced with prestressed carbon/epoxy FRP sheets demonstrate the superior performance of the hybrid system and emphasize its favorable strength, stiffness, and ductility characteristics. Finally, a methodology is described for the selection of composite material dimensions and initial prestressing to maximize structural performance.

AB - This paper presents finite element analyses and modeling techniques of I‐girder highway bridges. A wheel load distribution formula is developed using the results of finite element analysis, which can be used to calculate the flexural stresses in slab‐on‐girder bridges. A typical bridge design was selected, and one parameter was allowed to vary within practical ranges while the remaining parameters were held constant. The parameters considered were the size and spacing of steel girders, presence of cross bracing, concrete slab thickness, span length, single and continuous spans, and composite and noncomposite behavior. The developed wheel load distribution formula is similar in format to the current AASHTO specifications. The results predicted by the formula are compared with recently published research, which highlighted the importance of span length in calculating the wheel load distribution factors. This paper will assist bridge engineers and researchers in modeling and predicting the actual wheel load distribution in highway bridges.

AB - Seven large, extended end‐plate connections with eight tension bolts were fabricated and tested to failure at the Fritz Engineering Laboratory. Lehigh University. At least one connection failed by bolt fracture, weld fracture, or plate shear fracture. Experimental results led to concerns for bolt prying forces and end‐plate shear forces. Finite element analysis models, using shell elements for the end plate and beam flanges and plane‐stress elements for the beam web, were developed for the connections. Elastic and inelastic finite element solutions were obtained by using the ADINA program to provide predictions of the magnitude of shear force in the plate projection and the increases in bolt force due to prying action. The analytically predicted bolt forces were compared with the experimentally measured forces and reasonable agreement was found. Simple design rules, which complement the current design procedures for unstiffened end‐plate connections, are presented.

AB - The strength of a slender composite steel‐concrete beam column differs from the computed nominal value, which is based on specified nominal strengths of constituent materials, geometric properties, and code design equations. The variability in the strength is caused by the variations in the strengths of concrete and steel, the cross‐section dimensions of concrete and steel sections, the placement of steel sections and reinforcing bars, and the strength model itself, among other factors. This study was undertaken to investigate the variability of ultimate strength of slender composite beam columns in which steel shapes are encased in cast‐in‐place concrete. The results of this study indicate that the slenderness ratio, the structural steel ratio, and the end eccentricity ratio significantly influence the probability distribution properties of slender composite beam‐column strength, whereas the effect of specified concrete strength seems to be significant only for beam columns with a low slenderness ratio.

AB - Four tests are performed to investigate the cyclic behavior of beam‐to‐column subassemblages utilizing bolted extended end‐plate joints. The tests are conducted by applying a constant axial load to the column while subjecting the beam to cyclic controlled displacement program. The overall behavior of the subassemblages is examined. In addition, the behavior of their individual components such as beams, columns, connections, and panel zones is assessed separately. An evaluation of the performance of the subassemblages and their individual components in terms of stiffness, strength, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity is carried out. The ultimate shear strength of the panel zones was compared with measurement from the tests. It is concluded that a good performance can be achieved by allowing the beam and the panel zone to participate efficiently in dissipating the input energy with only localized plastification taking place in the connection.

AB - The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamic response of a cable‐stayed bridge to a vehicle moving across rough bridge decks. The vehicle was simulated by a nonlinear vehicle model with seven degrees of freedom according to the HS20‐44 truck. The cable‐stayed bridge was modeled as a planar bar system. Road‐surface roughness of the approach roadways and bridge decks was generated from power spectral density (PSD) function for very good, good, and average roads according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) specifications. The analytical procedure in this study considered geometric nonlinear behavior of the cables, girder, towers, and piers due to dead load. To solve the equations of motion of a bridge with many degrees of freedom, a new numerical procedure for analyzing the dynamic response of a bridge to a moving vehicle is proposed. The impact percentages in the bridge due to the vehicle moving over different classes of roads with various speeds were studied.

AB - Some practical issues associated with the application of viscoelastic (VE) dampers to building structures for seismic performance enhancement are studied in this paper. A sequential procedure is developed for optimally placing VE dampers to structures, based on the concept of degree of controllability. This optimal placement procedure is then experimentally verified using a five‐story steel model structure. Economical use of the VE dampers is made possible by adding them to the optimal locations found by this procedure, as is clearly demonstrated by the numerical examples and experimental results presented in the paper. A design procedure is also presented by which damper dimensions, number, and locations needed to achieve desired level of additional damping can be determined in accordance with the structural parameters and structural‐response reduction requirement. Design of VE dampers for a 24‐story steel frame is presented as an example, showing the complete design procedure for applying VE dampers to realistic structures.

AB - A nonlinear, two‐dimensional, finite element method of analysis is developed for multilayered, horizontally nail‐laminated beams. Nodal load‐displacement relationships are formulated for a special nail element using direct physical arguments. The nail element is used to model nail shear joints between layers, and it is the only element in addition to the conventional plane‐frame element that is needed to model the laminated assemblies. The method of analysis is versatile in that no limitation need be placed on the number of layers in the assembly, nor do the layers have to be continuous or complete. The wood members used in an assembly can be of different height, width, and stiffness. No restriction need be placed on the location, number, or variety of fasteners used in an assembly. Likewise, no constraints need be placed on the type, number, or location of supports. While the method of analysis was developed for nail‐laminated beams, it can also be used to analyze beams fabricated with semirigid adhesive.

AB - A methodology for the analysis of geometrically imperfect framed structures that takes into consideration geometrical and material nonlinearities is presented. The analysis is an extension of the pseudo-load method for geometrical and material nonlinear frame analysis by Lui in 1988, and Lui and Zhang in 1990. In the formulation, geometrical imperfections present in the form of initial crookedness and out-of-plumbness are accounted for by a pseudocurvature loading on the member. A parametric study of inelastic framed structures with geometrical imperfections has indicated that the effect of the out-of-plumbness of the frame is more significant than the effect of out-of-straightness of the member. A moment-magnification factor that accounts for the out-of-plumbness effect in building design is proposed.

AB - A series solution for stresses and displacements in a rectangular plate that is simply supported at three corners has been developed. Surprisingly simple and rigorous formulae for maximum displacement under arbitrary load are given. This is due to the fact that only one term in the series contributes to the displacement of the unsupported corner. This term is orthogonal in energy to all the other terms, and therefore can be immediately found without solving the system of equations. The system of equations to find the coefficients in the series is obtained by applying the conditions of minimum potential energy. A table with maximum displacements and maximum absolute values for principal moments for different ratios of sides has been given. Results are used for an aluminum auto part design optimization.
