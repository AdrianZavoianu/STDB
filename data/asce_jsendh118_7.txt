AB - Determination of fracture toughness values in modes I and II for wood are considered. The testing methods are based on the American Society for Testing and Materials standard “plane strain fracture toughness of metallic materials,” which considers mode I only. For the KI test, a modification of the standard is proposed. It is proposed that crack initiation be done with a very thin blade saw, and a larger nonlinearity of the load‐displacement curve is suggested. For the KII test, a similar testing and analysis method is applied to a beam specimen with an end crack. Fracture toughness values are presented, and their dependence on the material and experimental parameters is studied. For mode I., the orientation of the specimen is of great importance. For mode II, the most important variable is the density of the wood material. The fracture toughness value for modes I and II was not affected by the moisture content of the specimens in the range of 10‐20%.

AB - The determination of the critical J‐integral value for wood is considered. The methods are based on the American Society for Testing and Materials standard “JIC, a measure of fracture toughness.” A significant revision of the method proposed in the J‐integral standard is needed. Three possibilities for analyzing of the results are developed. The graphical method presupposes no knowledge of the material properties and relies on the recorded Jhyphen;integral versus crack growth curve. The compliance method uses the compliance data recorded during each loading and unloading cycle and the maximum load. The measured maximum load can also be inserted in an equation based on the finite element method. Another method based on the standard “plane strain fracture toughness of metallic materials” is used to study the dependence between the critical J‐integral and the experimental and material parameters. The determined critical J‐integral values are independent of the analysis method. The effect of time is observed: The slower J‐integral tests give a lower value than the more rapid fracture toughness (KIC) tests. The effects of moisture and the fracture system reflect the behavior of the modulus of elasticity.

AB - In the design of concrete hollow‐block masonry, different codes recommend different procedures for determination of the compressive strength of masonry. There is as yet no acceptance of a single standard test. Reviewing the present specifications and the various theoretical and experimental research in this area, the need for a detailed study of the important parameters influencing the compression behavior of concrete hollow‐block masonry prisms is brought out. A theoretical investigation has been undertaken using a three‐dimensional finite element analysis. The effects of different parameters (such as type of hollow‐block geometry, bonding arrangements, type of mortar bedding, and mortar material properties) on the behavior of masonry prisms under axial compression are discussed. Recommendations are made so as to evolve more rational specifications and a uniform test procedure.

AB - A design procedure for optimizing structural topologies is presented. The member sizes are the design variables and the constraints are related to stresses, displacements, and bounds on the variables. The proposed procedure is intended to overcome some basic difficulties involved in the solution process. A near optimal solution is achieved by solving sequentially several simple subproblems. A main feature of this approach is that the exact analysis of the structure need not be repeated many times during the solution process. The effectiveness of the proposed solution procedure is demonstrated by several examples. It is shown that optimal topologies are significantly better than nonoptimal ones.

AB - Thin‐walled channel sections may undergo a mode of buckling, called distortional, in which a lip‐stiffened flange of the section rotates about the flange‐web junction. If the sections are composed of high‐strength steel, then there may be a significant postbuckling reserve of strength beyond the elastic distortional buckling stress in a similar manner to that which normally occurs for local buckling. The results of compression tests of thin‐walled channel section columns formed by brake‐processing are described. Two different section geometries, a simple lipped channel and a lipped channel with an intermediate stiffener in the web, were tested between fixed‐end boundary conditions. The geometries and yield strength were chosen to ensure that a substantial postbuckling strength reserve occurred in the distortional mode and that local buckling might occur simultaneously at a shorter wavelength. Distortional or mixed local‐distortional buckling stresses obtained from testing are compared with theoretical buckling stresses. Design curves for the maximum strength of the columns undergoing distortional or mixed modes of buckling are proposed and compared with the test results.

AB - The behavior of and damage inflicted on stone‐masonry buildings during the Kalamata, Greece, earthquake of 1986 is studied statistically and analytically. Damage is shown to be almost statistically uncorrelated to the structural geometry of the building and its walls. The response of three typical two‐story buildings to the recorded ground motion is analyzed, assuming linear elasticity and employing three different idealizations of the structure: (1) Elaborate modeling in three dimensions by the finite element method; (2) idealization as a space frame; and (3) a crude shear‐beam type of approximation. In the first two modeling approaches, both in‐plane stresses and out‐of‐plane bending are taken into account. The three models are assessed on the basis of their ability to predict the location and severity of damage. Finite element analysis is the only reliable procedure among the three alternatives studied. The results from the finite element method also show that out‐of‐plane bending and the transfer of out‐of‐plane lateral loads to the transverse walls cause most of the damage.

AB - The present design interaction equations for steel beam‐columns subjected to end moments and axial loads employ a simplified form of elastic moment amplification factor. This amplification factor is conservative for some values of axial load and unconservative for other values. To accurately represent the amplification factor over a wide range of axial loads, a refined expression for elastic amplification was proposed in the previous literature. This elastic amplification factor provides a good estimation of the amplified moment only for members with very high slenderness ratios that fail by elastic buckling. Members with intermediate slenderness ratios, particularly those with high shape factor, will fail by inelastic buckling, and this inelasticity will have a major influence on the strength of these members. To accurately include the effects of inelasticity in the design interaction equations, this paper develops expressions for an inelastic amplification factor (IAF). The IAF expressions are developed using numerical results obtained by carrying out inelastic analysis of beam‐columns with various shape factors, slenderness ratios, and end moments. Design interaction equations with the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) B1‐factor and the IAF are compared with numerical inelastic strength of beam‐columns.

AB - This paper presents a new problem in linear viscoelastic structural analysis. Homogeneous structures with rigid restraints, where stress relaxation is prevented at a time after loading, are studied. This restriction produces time‐dependent increments in the initial displacements. In addition, if the structure has more than one initial redundant reaction, a significant stress redistribution also occurs. Assuming the increments of displacement of the cross section where the stress relaxation is prevented as unknown, the equation of equilibrium assumes the form of an integral Volterra equation. This mathematical formulation leads to the definition of an integral function (which only takes into account creep effects) that make resolving the problem by affinity to elastic quantities easy. The problem examined is related by duality to the well‐known problem of delayed restraints (also called change of structural system), in which the additional restraints, introduced after loading, prevent the creep increments of displacements at their points of application. Finally, the relation existing between the relaxation function and the integral function obtained is shown.

AB - A new approximate method that overcomes some limitations of the current design procedures for determining effective‐length factors for columns in braced frames is presented. Generalized stability functions are developed, including a linear model for joint flexibility and the column‐strength curve of the Structural Stability Research Council (SSRC) to take into account the inelastic behavior of members subjected to axial compression. Thereafter, a mathematical formulation based on the interaction between the column being analyzed and the adjacent members is presented by considering differentiated stiffness parameters as well as the boundary conditions at the far ends of all the attached elements. A computer program was implemented and an extensive numerical analysis about the influence of the involved variables was performed. It is proved that the use of some current design methods, such as the alignment‐chart procedure and related modifications, may provide unconservative results.

AB - The paper presents the derivation of a theoretical model for the time‐dependent response of simply supported steel‐concrete composite beams. The concrete is modeled on a computer using the age‐adjusted effective modulus method, and slip at the steel‐concrete interface is included. The theory is compared with test results reported elsewhere, and the agreement is shown to be good. The comparison is for deflections up to 250 days from loading, and for section strains that include interfacial slip. Slip strains are calculated in the time‐dependent domain using the computer model. It is shown that the slip strains are increased by the interaction of creep, shrinkage, and connector modulus, but their absolute values are still reasonably small at service loads. The computer model forms a basis for deriving design rules, and lends itself to extension to continuous composite beams and slabs. The analysis is presented in a form that may be applied to other models for predicting the time‐dependent response of the concrete.

AB - The effectiveness of various seismic‐strengthening techniques of stone masonry buildings is assessed through linear elastic finite element analyses. The strengthening methods examined are: (1) Reinforced concrete tie‐beams at the floor and roof levels; (2) replacement of wood floors by reinforced concrete slabs; (3) reinforced concrete tie‐columns at all junctions of load‐bearing walls; (4) shotcrete jackets over the entire external and/or internal wall surface; (5) horizontal prestressing of the spandrels; and (6) vertical prestressing of the piers. Combinations of methods, such as 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 5 and 6, etc., are also studied. The criterion for the effectiveness of a technique is the mean reduction of principal elastic tensile stresses in the masonry wall relative to the unstrengthened building for the combination of gravity loads with a seismic loading representative of the maximum expected earthquake loading in the building's conventional lifetime. Results are given separately for the walls normal to or parallel to the seismic action, for each story, and for the building as a whole. The most effective strengthening is the two‐sided shotcrete jackets, followed by the easy‐to‐construct combination of RC slabs and a RC tie‐beam at the top.

AB - Supplemental damping devices have been used to decrease the dynamic response of buildings subjected to wind and earthquake inputs. These devices can be generalized into the following three major types: friction devices, viscous or viscoelastic devices, and material yield devices. Lead dampers would be included in this last case, even though its characteristics do not involve yielding. A study of one of the metallic yield devices, the steel‐plate added damping and stiffness (ADAS) device, is presented. Yield force, yield displacement, strain‐hardening ratio, ratio of the device stiffness to the bracing member stiffness, and ratio of device stiffness to structural story stiffness without the device in place have been identified as the most important parameters to characterize the performance of this device. The influence of these parameters on earthquake response of building structures is analyzed. The results show that these devices can substantially increase the energy dissipation capacity of a structure and significantly reduce the energy dissipation demand on the framing members of a structure.

The strength of these angles is quite different from that of regular 90° angles. Results of experimental investigation on schifflerized angles are presented. The test results are compared with the loads computed according to ASCE Manual No. 52 and American Institute of Steel Construction load and resistance factor design specifications. The ambiguity regarding the proper selection of the width to be used in the calculation of width‐thickness ratios is discussed, and recommendations are made. The susceptibility of these angles of torsional‐flexural buckling is highlighted, and design recommendations are given. In addition, a table for design compressive strength of these angles that can serve as a ready‐to‐use design aid is provided.

A 6 ft high by 9 ft wide (1.83m×2.74m) plane portal frame was designed and constructed of glass/vinylester pultruded FRP thin‐walled sections. Data obtained from short‐term load tests on the frame are presented. Failure of the beam‐to‐column connections and compression flange buckling of the girder are discussed. An analytical investigation was performed to predict the nonlinear response of the frame. The numerical model includes the effects of axial, shear, and flexural deformation of the pultruded numbers, flexibility of the beam‐to‐column connections, and the postbuckling of the frame girder. An expression for the nonlinear rotational stiffness of the pultruded beam‐to‐column connection is presented. The experimental data, obtained from the full‐size test, are compared with the analytical model.

AB - Seismic response characteristics of a 2/5‐scale steel frame structure with added viscoelastic dampers are studied experimentally. The major emphasis is placed on the ambient temperature effect. It is shown that, while seismic response characteristics of a structure can be significantly improved with added dampers, their degree of effectiveness depends on the surrounding temperature within which they operate. Results also show that, even at very high temperatures, the viscoelastically damped structure can still achieve a significant reduction of structural response as compared with when no dampers are added. Designing viscoelastic dampers by considering the ambient temperature is addressed. Empirical equations are established based on regression analysis using data obtained from component tests of the dampers. These equations can satisfactorily estimate the dynamic properties of dampers under various ambient temperatures, excitation frequencies, and deformations. Numerical simulations are carried out on equivalent structural damping and structural response under various ambient temperatures. It has been demonstrated that the dynamic behavior of structures with added viscoelastic dampers can be satisfactorily predicted by conventional analytical tools.
