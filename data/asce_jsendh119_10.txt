AB - The approach presented in this paper is considered a viable alternative for the prediction of distributed discrete concrete cracking. Cracks are confined to the edges of elements of the mesh. Different crack‐initiation criteria are used for concrete and concrete‐steel interfaces. A discontinuous linear relation between crack width and tensile stress is proposed. Link elements are installed to connect the faces of a crack. The tensile stress associated with the crack is integrated along crack faces to obtain equivalent nodal forces. These nodal forces are then used to evaluate the stiffness of the link elements. The procedure is automated for iterative analysis. Crack‐width control and fracture‐energy control are proposed as auxiliary solution constraints to deal with convergence problems. Identification and treatment of mechanisms is proposed to avoid mechanism singularities in the solution process. An example application demonstrates the capability of the approach to predict the pattern of progression of dominant cracks, the interface behavior, and the correlation between these and specimen behavior.

AB - The lateral load resistance of tall wall‐frame building structures comprising a combination of moment‐resisting frames and shear walls that are reduced in size or terminated entirely at intermediate heights is investigated. A generalized theory for the deflection of such structures is developed on the basis of a continuum model, to show that curtailment of the walls is not necessarily detrimental to the performance of the structure. Indeed, if the walls are curtailed within a certain height region the forces in the upper part of the frame are reduced while the top deflection is negligibly affected. An expression for the deflection of curtailed uniform wall‐frame structures is minimized to provide guidance for the optimum level of wall curtailment to cause a minimum increase in the top deflection. Guidance on the level of curtailment without detriment to the structure's performance for practical nonuniform wall‐frame structures is given.

AB - Lateral restrained and free buckling of I‐beams often represent a limiting factor in their bending performance. Consideration of this becomes increasingly  more important when the engineer seeks full advantage of new thermomechanically rolled high‐yield‐strength steels. The writers present a solution to this problem consisting of warping‐preventing devices in form of U‐sections connected  to the web and flanges of the I‐section. General expressions based on Fourier expansion of the displacements, enabling the determination of the elastic critical loads given the characteristics of the stiffeners (i.e., number, stiffness, and position along the axis of the I profile) are developed. Typical examples illustrate that the proposed stiffeners are very efficient, in particular if they are placed near their optimum position. Therefore the same examples show the efficiency of the stiffeners as a function of their position. Just one or two stiffeners near their optimum positions increases the elastic critical stress by a multiplier in the range 2 to 4.

AB - Based on a continuous type of solution, an alternative formulation for the decoupling of the lateral‐equilibrium equations in eccentric multistory building structures is presented. By referring the floor displacements to the center of twist at each floor (Tso and Cheung 1986), the original set of three differential equations are decoupled into three independent ones. Closed‐form expressions for the torsional angle and twist center are obtained, enabling the relevant parameters influencing the structural behavior to be detected, as well as a better understanding of the lateral‐torsional coupling effect in eccentric multistory building structures under lateral loads.

AB - Test results of 17 axially prestressed concrete beams without stirrups and containing a transverse circular opening are presented. Mainly, beams having two different opening diameters were subjected to various combinations of torsion and bending. Test results show that the bending moment has a beneficial effect and increases the torsional strength for beams with high T/M ratios. For beams with low T/M ratios; however, the torsional strength decreases rapidly with increasing the bending moment. Strength equations to predict the torsional strength at initial cracking are developed. Based upon the initial cracking strength, empirical equations are suggested to predict the ultimate torsional strength for all combinations of torsion and bending. The proposed equations predicted closely the torsional strength of the test beams. Comparison of similar prestressed concrete beams with and without stirrups shows that the introduction of stirrups promotes the development of a consistent failure pattern and increases the ductility and the torsional strength considerably.

AB - Elastic columns with two spans of arbitrary length ratio are investigated. The base is pinned and may include a rotational spring. An elastic support acts between the spans, and the top is pinned or supported elastically. An axial load is applied. For perfect columns, the effects of the internal support location and the spring stiffnesses on the critical load and buckling mode are determined. Under special conditions, an ideal spring stiffness exists, such that the elastic supports do not deflect when the column buckles. Imperfect columns with an initial deflection of the same shape as the buckling mode of the corresponding perfect column are also considered. Deflections and bracing forces at the elastic supports are obtained as functions of the axial load, and approximations in terms of the amplification factor are discussed. These results are utilized in a sequel to this paper, which examines design rules for the required stiffness and strength of bracing.

AB - Lateral bracing requirements for two‐span elastic columns are examined. The braces are represented by elastic translational springs. The columns have pinned supports at the base, an internal brace at an arbitrary point, and either a pinned support or a brace at the top, where an axial load is applied. They may be perfect or may have an initial deflection. The effects of the span lengths, bracing stiffnesses, and initial deflection shapes are studied. For perfect columns, the bracing stiffness required for a given critical load is determined. For imperfect columns, the required bracing stiffness corresponding to a given deflection under a given load is investigated. Based on the results, design guidelines for bracing stiffness and strength are recommended. The rules depend on the end conditions and the location of the internal brace. For imperfect columns, they also depend on the initial deflection and the allowable size of the deflection of the column under a specified compressive load.

AB - Torsion in base‐isolated structures with inelastic elastomeric isolation systems due to bidirectional lateral ground motion is studied. In a companion paper by the writers, torsional coupling in sliding base‐isolated structures was investigated. In this paper, which is the second part of the sequence, torsional coupling in elastomeric base‐isolated structures is investigated. Various multistoried structural systems with elastomeric isolation systems are investigated, with the objective of studying the influence of: (1) The flexibility of the superstructure; (2) the ratio of uncoupled torsional to lateral frequencies; (3) stiffness eccentricity in the superstructure; (4) eccentricity in the isolation system; (5) higher mode effects; and (6) number of bearings in the isolation system. Response to different ground motions is also studied. The results are used to explain: (1) The behavior of actual buildings; and (2) some inconsistencies in the conclusions of previous studies. It is shown that, although the total superstructure response is reduced significantly due to the effects of elastomeric base isolation, torsional amplification can be significant depending on the isolation and superstructure eccentricity and the lateral and torsional flexibility.

AB - Results of a study are presented in which the performance of code‐designed fixed‐base and base‐isolated concrete frames are compared. The purpose of the investigation is to compare in a quantitative manner the relative performance of code‐designed frames, and to determine approximately the design force level for an isolated frame that will result in performance comparable to that of the fixed‐base frame. The fixed‐base frames were designed in accordance with the 1990 Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC) Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary. The base‐isolated frames were designed to varying levels of the SEAOC‐recommended base shear. Time‐history analyses were conducted for three ensembles of recorded earthquakes. Analysis considered the nonlinear behavior of the isolation system and superstructure. Statistical analysis of peak response quantities demonstrates the superior performance of the code‐designed isolated structures. Results illustrate that comparable performance is generally achieved when the isolated frames are designed to between 25% and 50% of the recommended lateral force.

AB - Design aids for estimating the seismic effects on deck type of arch bridges are presented. They are based on the in‐plane response of a linearized model. For the model, the structural tangent stiffness at the end of a nonlinear analysis for the dead‐load response is used as the linear stiffness in the subsequent linear seismic response calculations. Comparisons with results produced by using a nonlinear analysis throughout the ground motion indicated very close agreement. The design aids are based on the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials response spectrum. Time‐history solutions were also obtained for parabolic ribs using three earthquakes. Their averages are found to be similar to the response spectrum results. The design aids give, for every eighth panel point, stress amplification factors from which the seismic (plus dead load) stress may be obtained, and maximum vertical and horizontal displacements. The presented data should cover most practical ranges of the parameters defining arch bridges with parabolic and circular ribs, with hinged or fixed supports.

AB - This paper outlines the development of a technique for the examination of the seismic performance of joist and beam bearing connections in unreinforced masonry structures. An understanding of these “pocket” connections will allow for better estimates of the behavior of brick buildings, and provide a useful tool for the design of seismic retrofit details, particularly in cases when it is imperative to minimize the interventions. A finite‐element model that accounts for the friction and impact behavior at the diaphragm‐to‐wall interface is developed. An equivalent coefficient‐of‐restitution procedure is described to account for energy loss in collisions between flexible bodies. Several simple but representative examples illustrate the method and demonstrate its ability to capture the sliding and impact behavior at the connection detail. (In the companion paper, a historic brick building that was shaken during the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, is modeled using the approach described herein.)

AB - It has been known for some time that connections in unreinforced masonry structures play a major role in the performance of such structures. Few attempts have been made to analytically address these components. An understanding of these “pocket” connections will allow for better estimates of the behavior of brick buildings and provide a useful tool for the design of seismic retrofit details. Previous investigations have centered on the linear or nonlinear response of the brick walls themselves, or the floor and root diaphragms. The movement between the floor and roof diaphragms and the wall has not been previously considered. (A companion paper presented the development of a technique for the examination of the seismic performance of joist and beam bearing connections in unreinforced masonry structures.) A historic brick building that was shaken during the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 is modeled herein using this approach. The effect of motion at the diaphragm‐to‐wall interface is discussed. A discussion of the importance of several parameters, including bearing length, coefficient of friction, coefficient of restitution, and distance from end of joist to end of wall is presented.

AB - A new design specification for engineered wood structures has been proposed in load and resistance factor design (LRFD) format. This paper provides an overview of the proposed LRFD connections design criteria. The connections design provisions are, in part, calibrated from allowable stress design provisions. Major changes from historic practice, however, result from a change in behavioral equations to a theoretical base for predicting the lateral strength of connections using bolts, screws, and nails. New provisions for axial withdrawal of driven and turned fasteners, as well as combined axial and lateral loading criteria are also proposed. Safety levels were calibrated to historic practice, but some change in design capacity is expected due to format change, conversion to new behavioral equations, and the selection of a calibration point. The LRFD document contains substantial improvement in code clarity, simplification, and structure over the historic allowable stress specification. A clear mechanism for including design with new wood‐based engineering materials is provided.

AB - Static force procedures of most building codes require that the lateral earthquake force at each floor level of an asymmetric‐plan building be applied eccentrically from the centers of rigidity. To implement such procedures, it seemed necessary in the past to determine the locations of the centers of rigidity, an often confusing and cumbersome process. This paper presents a new approach for code lateral force analysis of asymmetric‐plan buildings without locating the centers of rigidity. This procedure combines the results from three static analyses, which can be implemented directly on most commercially available computer programs for analysis of multistory buidings. The work presented in this paper should dispel the long‐held view that locations of the centers of rigidity must be determined to implement the code procedure, thereby removing one of the major difficulties in building analysis.

AB - Ten continuous, rolled‐steel‐beam Interstate Highway bridges containing welded cover plates and welded splices were analyzed for fatigue life according to guidelines issued by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in 1990. The bridges were entirely field welded and constructed before 1970, when the extreme fatigue sensitivity of cover‐plate terminations was unknown to design engineers. Each bridge is subjected to high volumes of truck traffic and contains AASHTO Category E′ cover plates at every pier. The fatigue‐life calculations incorporated site‐specific truck‐traffic data and lateral distribution factors smaller than typical design values. Although the results indicated the calculated mean fatigue life has already been exceeded at a minimum of one cover‐plate termination in eight of the 10 bridges, nondestructive inspection revealed that cracking had not occurred. Even though it is very encouraging that the actual service performance of these bridges is superior to analytical predictions, bridge engineers would appreciate guidance on how to make the best use of fatigue‐life predictions. Since funds for bridge repair are difficult to obtain, it would be imprudent to initiate bridge rehabilitation projects based solely on the results of fatigue‐life calculations. The best analytical results will be obtained when site‐specific data are available, and tests conducted on segments salvaged from similar bridges can be justified in certain instances.

AB - Analytical and experimental approaches are presented to monitor the tension levels in posttensioned high‐strength steel rods of stressed‐timber systems. The dynamic response of these rods under an impact load is correlated with the rod tension. The dominant frequencies of the rod stressed to different tension levels are consistently distinguishable. An increase in frequency is consistently observed with increases in the rod tension levels. An analytical relation is developed to correlate the dominant frequencies to the tension level in the rod. The proposed technique can predict the tension levels with a 85–90% accuracy of the experimental results. The nondestructive approach proposed herein is intended for future use in structural inspection of stressed timber bridges.

AB - The buckling loads, buckling lengths, and P‐delta effects for pitched roof frames with different loading arrangements are examined. Results are compared to some common and internationally known code results. It was found that the load distribution significantly affects the buckling loads and hence the buckling lengths and the magnified (or added) moments. This paper clarifies a defect in some national building codes and encourages the use of computers in determining the buckling loads and/or the magnified moments. It is worth noting that although the program suggested is simple, it is robust and could be used to trace the large deformation characteristics of frames.

AB - In this paper, the guide specifications for bridge base isolation published  in 1991 by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials  (AASHTO) are briefly summarized and discussed. The effective stiffness and equivalent damping ratio given in the AASHTO isolation specifications are evaluated. Based on this study, it is concluded that the equivalent damping ratio determined using the AASHTO procedure may decrease with respect to the increase  of the inelastic deformation of lead‐rubber bearings. In addition, the equivalent  damping ratios calculated for a single‐degree‐of‐freedom system subjected to a generated AASHTO design earthquake may be larger than 30% for a wide fundamental period range. As a result, a three‐dimensional inelastic time‐history analysis as required by the AASHTO provisions may be necessary. However, to require a three‐dimensional inelastic time‐history analysis could be a dilemma for the current bridge engineering design practice. As an alternate approach, an empirical  method is proposed for the determination of the effective period shift and equivalent damping ratio.
