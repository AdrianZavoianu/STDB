AB - The stability of masonry piers subjected to their own weight and to eccentric compressive force at the top is analyzed. Prismatic fixed free‐ended columns are examined, considering no tension material having linear behavior in compression. The column is ideally divided into a number of elements that is unknown a priori, all of the same length. Along each of them, the curvature corresponding to the equilibrium condition is assumed to be constant. For each assigned value of rotation of the free end this hypothesis makes it possible to express in recursion form the rotation of the cross sections characterizing the model, which obviously decreases with an increase in the number of elements considered starting from the upper cross section. The unknown length of the column corresponding to an assigned load condition is deduced from the number of elements needed to obtain a zero value of rotation, because the latter condition characterizes the section at the base. Applying the procedure with variation in the value of rotation of the free end, stability domains are deduced for different ratios between weight and concentrated load. The results, obtained in dimensionless form, show the optimum value of this ratio for a given eccentricity value.

AB - The shakedown analysis of elastoplastic plane frames with semirigid connections is considered within a framework of discrete models and piecewise linear yield surfaces. The formulation adopted is based on the classical Bleich‐Melan  static theorem, and leads to a linear programming problem. A simple linear elastic perfectly plastic connection element is used to account for the reduced flexibility and partial strength of semirigid beam‐to‐column connections. The necessary conditions of equilibrium and of yield conformity are expressed compactly in matrix form, and the calculation of the elastic locus for the cyclic‐load domain is clarified. A means of identifying whether incremental collapse or alternating plasticity governs failure under repeated loading is also mentioned. Finally, three examples are presented primarily as a preliminary assessment of the shakedown behavior of semirigid frames. In particular, it is shown that the shakedown limit of such structures can be significantly lower than the corresponding plastic collapse limit. The importance of considering axial effects on plasticity and of using the correct elastic stiffness in shakedown calculations are also highlighted.

AB - Basic information on a temperature collapse of a building structure in fire can be obtained after fire‐endurance tests are carried out in special furnaces. The results of fire tests alone do not give rise to formulate the general rules that govern the process of building structure collapse in fire. It is therefore necessary to make a theoretical analysis of these tests. This may also be worthwhile for economical reasons, since the preparation and performing of the fire tests lasts several days and is rather expensive. In this paper, the differential equation of buckling steel columns during fire has been both formulated and solved. Rigidities and fire resistances of the columns have been also derived. The presented analysis of columns is based on a nonelastic model of steel and considers steel creep. With the help of proposed method it is possible to predict the results of fire‐endurance tests on given steel columns and generalize these results over the columns under different static diagrams, lengths, and loadings.

AB - Although cold‐formed steel C‐ and Z‐shaped members possess a very favorable strength‐to‐weight ratio, are easily fabricated and erected, and offer a cost‐effective structural design solution, they can be highly susceptible to local buckling. To adequately address the impact of the local buckling limit state, a complex, time‐consuming design office effort may be required. Therefore, to facilitate the design of such shapes, a study was conducted that focused on developing relatively simple, easy‐to‐apply design guidelines. The design guidelines address the behavior of cold‐formed steel C‐ and Z‐shaped members when used as either a flexural member or a compression member. Both edge‐stiffened and unstiffened compression elements are considered by the design guidelines. The design guidelines are unique in that they employ the concept of applying strength‐reduction factors to either the bending strength or the axial compression strength. All strength computations use the full cross‐section areas.

AB - This paper presents an efficient computer‐automated method for the optimum design of steel frameworks accounting for the behavior of semirigid connections.  The method explicitly accounts for both connections and members by taking connection stiffnesses and member sizes as continuous‐valued and discretevalued  variables to the design process, respectively. A continuous‐discrete optimization  algorithm is applied to minimize the ‘cost’ of the connections and members for the structure subject to constraints on stresses and displacements under specified design loads. Two steel framework examples are presented to illustrate the features of the design method. It is shown that the design optimization determines connection  stiffnesses that are entirely consistent with those for the actual (bolted/ welded) connections employed in conventional steel frameworks, but that member sizes are somewhat different from those found when the connections are (artificially) assumed to be fully rigid. That is, the results suggest that the proposed semirigid design method realistically accounts for connection behavior and produces more appropriate member sizes than does the traditional fully rigid design method.

AB - A simplified method is presented for analyzing hogging moments in internal deck slab panels of slab‐on‐girder bridges due to single concentrated loads on the deck slab overhangs. This analysis will be found useful for designing the curtailment of the hogging moment reinforcement extending from the overhang into the internal panel of the deck slab. Tables of coefficients needed for the proposed simplified analysis are provided to cover almost all of the cases likely to be encountered in practice. The tables of coefficients are applicable not only to the analysis of the deck slab in the internal panels but also in the overhangs. These coefficients were developed from the results of a large number of carefully performed  finite‐element analysis. A simple technique is also presented, by which the transverse moments in the internal panels and overhangs of deck slabs can be determined when the overhangs are edge‐stiffened.

AB - Because elastoplastic behavior is a very real possibility under the hazard of random actions during the lifetime of a structural system, it is natural that methods of reliability theory have to be used for the assessment of this type of behavior. The present paper is the first part of an investigation on holonomic elastoplastic reliability analysis of truss systems under random loads. The formulation  of a method that accounts for the nonlinear behavior of truss systems by using holonomic elastoplastic analysis is outlined. Following a brief description of the deterministic direct holonomic elastoplastic analysis formulation, a modified formulation is proposed for the purpose of reliability analysis. The derived formulation  is used in conjunction with both the elastoplastic mode generation method and the mathematical programming method to solve the reliability analysis problem of holonomic elastoplastic truss systems under random loads. In this problem, both excessive elastoplastic displacements and plastic collapse are considered as system limit states.

AB - This is the second of a two‐part paper on holonomic elastoplastic reliability analysis of truss systems under random loads. The present study concentrates  on two truss‐system application examples. Extensive computations based on the holonomic reliability theory developed in the first part of this investigation are carried out using the elastoplastic mode generation method coupled with the sequential linear programming method. The standard normal load space is used for representing both the convergence of the programming method and the sensitivity  of the most probable failure point to changes in allowable displacement. Furthermore, the effect of the allowable displacement on the reliability of holonomic  elastic‐perfectly plastic trusses is demonstrated in the application examples considering both independent and perfectly correlated loads. For practical applications,  it is shown that important computational gains may be achieved by using the proposed approach. This is mainly due to the elastoplastic mode generation method, which reduced the number of unknowns considerably.

AB - This paper presents a study to develop reliability‐based seismic design criteria for reinforced‐concrete intermediate moment‐resisting frame buildings. The seismic criteria in the LRFD format are established on the basis of the collapse of a frame system rather than the failure of a member. A reliability analysis method has been developed to calculate the annual collapse limit‐state probabilities of representative frame structures classified as ordinary buildings. These probabilities are then used to determine seismic‐load factors by means of optimization with respect to the specified acceptable risk levels. The seismic‐load factors have different  values in various seismic zones. To achieve more stringent acceptable risk levels required for high‐risk and essential buildings, the importance factor is used to increase structural strength and stiffness. Therefore, the seismic LRFD criteria developed in this study are applicable to three categories of buildings (ordinary, high risk, and essential) in various seismic zones in the United States.

AB - Two voided slab bridge models, one straight and the other curved in plan, were tested to failure under simulated American Assoc. of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) truck loading. Each model was quarterscale, two‐lane, continuous, and longitudinally and transversely posttensioned, with two equal spans of 8.0 m (26.27 ft) measured along the centerline, and were 2.0 m (6 ft 7 in.) wide. The curved bridge subtended an arc of 40° on a radius of curvature of 22.92 m (75.2 ft). The failure load was obtained for symmetrical placement of four simulated AASHTO trucks, one in each lane and each span. The observed failure mode in both bridge models was similar to that of a continuous beam, i.e., initiated by the formation of successive plastic hinges at the support and at the maximum positive moment location, respectively. The test results are compared against predictions from one‐dimensional beam analysis and two‐dimensional grillage analysis based on limit analysis using interaction relations for bending, shear, and torsion as failure criterion. Both analyses predict failure loads and failure modes that are in reasonable agreement, with test results from the one‐dimensional analysis providing a somewhat higher estimate.

AB - A Markov model is proposed to evaluate seismic performance and sensitivity to initial state of structural systems and determine the vulnerability of structures exposed to one or more earthquakes. The method of analysis is based on the seismic hazard modeled by a filtered Poisson process, nonlinear dynamic analysis for estimating structural response to earthquakes, uncertainty in initial damage state, and failure conditions incorporating damage accumulation during consecutive seismic events. Simple structures designed by the seismic design code are used to illustrate the proposed method. Effects of uncertainty in the initial state of these systems on seismic reliability are also investigated.

AB - An analytical investigation into the seismic performance of steel moment‐resisting frames is presented. The International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) provisions regarding seismic design of steel moment frames are summarized, and potential problems and discrepancies are noted. The results of prior research are reviewed, and prototype three‐, eight‐, and 20‐story frames are designed by an experienced designer. The inelastic responses of these frames are then determined for a range of different earthquake acceleration conditions. The analysis shows that strong‐column weak‐beam (SCWB) frames result in much smaller story drifts and better distribution of inelastic deformation and energy dissipation among elements in the structure than comparable weak‐column strong‐beam (WCSB) frames. The difference was most significant with earthquake acceleration records that cause significant yielding. Steel frames performed adequately if a spine of SCWB joints is used over the height of the structure. The computed results were compared to the results of past experiments. The comparison suggests the SCWB frames should be capable of sustaining the required deformations. The comparison did not provide a clear answer for WCSB frames, and so a series of experiments were performed. These experiments are described in the companion paper.

AB - An experimental evaluation of the seismic performance of moment‐resisting  steel frames using weak‐column strong‐beam joints is described. This study is a continuation of an analytical investigation described in a companion paper. Five half‐scale specimens are tested using an inelastic substructure technique of the pseudodynamic test method. Most of the structural frame is analyzed using standard inelastic techniques while a critical component of the frame is tested. Results from this study suggest that weak‐column strong‐beam frames have sufficient  ductility to sustain the inelastic demand induced by a major seismic event, but only if the base shear strength is larger than the minimum required by the Uniform Building Code. A frame tested with the minimum design base shear strength failed during the earthquake. Other characteristics, such as slenderness of the column cross section and axial load ratio, affect hysteretic behavior, but the overstrength of base shear capacity has the largest influence on the satisfactory performance of weak‐column strong‐beam frames.

AB - Results of laboratory tests on four reinforced concrete flat slab‐interior  column connections, carrying quasi‐static, cyclic, horizontal loadings are presented. The specimens, at about two‐thirds scale, had reinforcing steel arrangements  representative of column strips. The major aspects studied are the resistance and final failure mechanisms, the relative influence of the cross‐sectional width of the column, and the contribution of vertical gravity loading on the propagation of failure. Test results show that combined primary bending, slab failures, and final one‐side punching‐shear failures had occurred. The failure contributors, their development  areas, and final shape are described. The results of the present series of tests are compared with solutions of current calculation methods, which suggest using either the full slab width between the field centerlines, beam analogies, or the linear shear stress distribution on a critical perimeter around the column.

The vehicle is idealized as a pair of concentrated forces, with no mass, traveling, on circumferential  paths with constant velocity. Analysis of multigirder and continuous span bridges indicates a tendency for frequency clustering. Static solutions for these bridges are compared against mode superposition and direct integration. The bridge behavior was studied under several truck loading paths. Static and dynamic bridge behavior was observed under these loadings. A rational methodology for determining  the impact factor is developed, and alternate impact‐factor criteria are proposed to replace the current American Association of State Highway and Transportation  Officials guide specification.

AB - An active bracing system has been designed, fabricated, and installed in a full‐scale dedicated test structure in Tokyo, Japan, for structural‐response control under seismic loads. In 1991, Soong et al. presented the design of the system along with simulation studies for the design earthquake. Presented in this paper, which is the second part of the sequence, are: (1) The description of the constructed system; and (2) the observed performance of the system under two actual earthquakes and other artificial loadings. Installation details of the system in the building structure are presented along with the selections for fail‐safe shutdown operations in case of malfunctions. Also presented are the procedures for proper maintenance and self‐testing, which ensure continuous control with minimal resources. The observed performance under artificial loadings and actual ground motions is compared with the estimated analytical response.

AB - To simplify the procedure of designing viscous dampers for stay cables in bridges, a universal estimation curve is proposed that relates the modal damping ratio of the cable with attached damper, the mode number, the damper size, the damper location, and three parameters of the cable: span, mass per unit length, and fundamental frequency. The curve is obtained from numerical complex‐eigenvalue analysis of a taut cable with a single damper near the anchorage, with judicious grouping of these parameters into nondimensional factors. Several numerical examples illustrate the convenient use of this design aid, as well as show realistic values of the required damper size and location and the expected additional damping in the first few modes. The damping to be attained is usually high enough to suppress most vibrations induced by wind. However it is noted that a small sag of the cable and slight nonviscous properties of the damper may reduce the damper effectiveness. A modified design curve may have to incorporate these parameters to provide better accuracy.
