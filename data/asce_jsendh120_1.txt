AB - Nonlinear response of torsionally coupled base isolated system to random ground motion is obtained under different parametric variations using a simulation procedure. Parameters include those which characterize mass, stiffness, and damping properties of the superstructure (i.e., fixed base torsionally coupled system) and the base isolator. The mean peak responses from simulation analysis are compared to: (1) Corresponding fixed base system to investigate the effectiveness of base isolation; and (2) corresponding symmetric system to highlight the effect of torsional coupling. The isolator consists of an array of elastomeric bearings between the foundation and the rigid base slab. The bidirectional hysteretic restoring force provided by the isolator against horizontal movement is modeled by a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations. The results of the parametric study help in understanding the behavior and effective design of torsionally coupled bae isolated structures.

AB - Circular steel silos and tanks are often constructed from rolled‐steel plates with welded or bolted lap splices. Where the lap runs horizontally around the silo circumference, the lap connection causes a local eccentricity in the line of vertical thrust in the shell wall. This eccentricity induces high local bending stresses and circumferential membrane stresses, which are detrimental to the strength of the structure. Although elastic buckling of the shell wall may be the critical failure mode for thin lap‐jointed cylinders under axial load with no or small internal pressure, axisymmetric plastic collapse is the likely failure mode when the internal pressure is high, especially for relatively thicker cylinders. This paper presents a detailed study of the axisymmetric collapse behavior and strength of lap‐jointed cylinders under combined axial compression and internal pressure and establishes easy‐to‐use design equations for such shells.

AB - A heterogeneous hardening rule is proposed for concrete in this paper. Being different from the hardening rules in common use, by which the development of the subsequent yield surfaces from the initial yield surface is at a uniform rate with respect to the variation of the hardening parameter, the heterogeneous hardening rule deems that the development of the subsequent yield surface is at a nonuniform rate with regard to the change of the hardening parameter. Based on this hardening rule, a loading function including the effect of the hydrostatic pressure on the behavior of concrete is constructed. A simple and effective heterogeneous hardening plasticity model employing the associated flow rule is established for progressive failure analysis of concrete. With this model, the inelastic contraction and dilatation behavior of concrete under compression or tension‐compression stress states can be successfully represented. The model has been applied to the analysis of some available experimental data and good correlations are obtained between the analytical and experimental results.

AB - The failure of unreinforced masonry structures subjected to lateral loads is dominated, to a large extent, by the fracture of mortar joints as well as the cracking and crushing of masonry units. This can be simulated by means of a finite element approach in which the mortar joints are modeled with interface elements and the masonry units are modeled with smeared crack elements. To this end, a dilatant interface constitutive model capable of simulating the initiation and propagation of interface fracture under combined normal and shear stresses in both tension‐shear and compression‐shear regions, and capable of simulating the experimentally  observed dilatancy was developed in this study. The performance of the interface model in representing the behavior of masonry mortar joints is evaluated  with the available experimental results. Furthermore, the failure of unreinforced  concrete masonry panels is analyzed with the aforementioned approach. It is concluded that the numerical model is capable of predicting the response of a masonry assemblage based on the response of its basic constituents.

AB - This paper presents a decision‐support system for selecting the best set of strategies (projects) for bridge rehabilitation and replacement on a highway network, specifically during a long‐range planning of the bridge funding needs for budgeting and legislative purposes. The proposed methodology recognizes the following  aspects of the decision problem faced by the bridge engineer: (1) Multiple‐attribute  nature of bridge deficiencies; (2) risk impact of the predicted deterioration of the bridge; and (3) uncertainty due to the subjectively estimated decision variables.  Based on a systems approach, the decision theory concepts of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM), utility theory, and decision making under risk (DMUR) are applied in formulating a decision‐support system, with the estimates of the decision variables represented as fuzzy numbers. Modeling the predicted deteriorated state (condition) of the bridge as state fuzzy probability vectors, the feasible strategies for bridge rehabilitation and replacement are evaluated under each probable state of the bridge. The evaluation of projects at each bridge site is based on the possibility distributions of the expected fuzzy utilities, which are computed as a benefit index of each feasible strategy. An example application is also described to illustrate the application of this decision‐support system.

AB - A light‐frame wood structure is an assemblage of several components such as walls, floors, and roof, joined by intercomponent connections such as nails or metal plates. Behavior of a full structure reflects the interactive behavior of the individual components and connections. Whereas individual substructures have been investigated both experimentally and analytically, individual substructures and components of a light‐frame wood building have never been incorporated into a full‐structure model. This research provides an analytical method to investigate the behavior of light‐frame wood structures loaded by static loads. Special attention is given to load sharing among wall components. A one‐story wood‐frame building (4.9×9.8m) was tested under cyclic quasistatic loads. Results of the experiment were used to verify a nonlinear finite‐element model of the full building. The full‐structure  model was an assemblage of superelements, representing floor and roof, and quasisuperelements, representing walls and intercomponent connections. The special quasisuperelements were energetically equivalent to the detailed three‐dimensional  finite‐element models developed to represent the walls and intercomponent  connections. Boundary conditions and loads used in the experiment were applied to the model, and deformations and reaction forces were compared. Experimental  and analytical results agreed closely.

AB - A comprehensive experimental, analytical, and parametric investigation  of the performance of gypsum‐roof structures under severe earthquake excitations  is presented. Force‐deformation hysteresis were obtained from laboratory tests of typical gypsum panels to characterize the cyclic behavior of gypsum. The tests were also used to distinguish two levels of seismic performance: damage control and life safety. A special hysteretic model was developed to model the degrading behavior of the gypsum diaphragm. The model was incorporated into a special‐purpose computer program with the ability to model inelastic in‐plane diaphragm flexibility. The program was used to perform complete stiffness‐degrading inelastic analysis of typical gypsum‐roof structures subjected to a variety of accelerograms. The ensuing parametric study was directed at identifying a damage‐based criteria for both the design of new structures and the retrofit of existing structures.

AB - Reliability‐based optimization techniques are developed for steel structures subjected to seismic loadings of the Uniform Building Code and Newmark's  nondeterministic seismic response spectra. Reliability is based on two different  distributions of response and resistance with two variance approaches. Two objective functions of weight and cost, and various constraints, such as displacements,  yielding, and buckling of constituent members, are considered in the optimization  formulations. Numerical examples are provided to study sensitivities of parameters, such as variation of earthquake load, different probability distributions, different variance approaches, and interacting ground motion on optimum solutions.

AB - Buildings should be designed to resist moderate ground motion without structural damage and resist intense ground motion with controlled damage. However, most codes do not consider both these requirements explicitly and specify a single design earthquake that generally corresponds to intense ground motion. Investigated in this study is the response of one‐story, asymmetric‐plan systems designed according to torsional provisions of seismic codes to the two levels of ground motions with the objective of evaluating whether such systems satisfy these requirements. The presented results demonstrate that such systems may not remain elastic during moderate ground motion resulting in structural damage and may experience ductility demand in excess of the design ductility, causing excessive damage during intense ground motion. Therefore, the dual‐design approach, proposed earlier for symmetric‐plan systems, is extended to asymmetric‐plan systems. In this approach, the design earthquakes and the design eccentricities corresponding to the moderate and intense ground motions are considered to be different; for the latter ground motion, the values of design eccentricity are considered to depend on the design ductility of the system. It is shown in this exploratory investigation that systems designed by this extended dual‐design approach would satisfy the design requirements for both levels of ground motion.

AB - Second‐moment structural reliability analysis methods are used to assess the reliability levels implied by the current (1989) American Concrete Institute (ACI) code for 73 single‐span prestressed concrete beams commonly used in the construction industry for offices and retail buildings. The analysis is limited to only flexural load effects. Several limit states are considered, including permissible compressive and tensile stresses at both initial and final stages, flexural cracking, and ultimate strength. The loads, material and geometrical properties, prestressing force levels, and the models used to predict structural behavior at initial, final, and ultimate stages are all treated as random variables. The statistical parameters selected for these variables are believed to represent the present state of knowledge on uncertainties associated with prestressed concrete beams. The reliability levels are shown to be nonuniform over various ranges of live load levels, span lengths, and limit states. Information is also provided on the effects of secondary moments, cable eccentricities, and prestressing area on the reliability of a continuous three‐span prestressed concrete beam.

AB - This paper presents an automated Rayleigh‐Ritz method for the elastic buckling analysis of doubly symmetric I‐beams subjected to arbitrary loading conditions. Moreover, the beams may have various types of end‐supporting conditions, internal discrete rigid braces, and internal supports. The automation and the method's versatility are attributed to a general Ritz function consisting of the product of a polynomial function and the functions expressing the geometric restraint conditions. The method is simple and may be readily implemented on a personal computer. The solutions obtained are shown to be accurate provided a sufficient number of polynomial terms is taken. Buckling solutions of I‐beams under a variety of loading and boundary conditions are obtained to illustrate the generality of the method and serve as design charts.

AB - The paper presents a mechanical model to simulate the behavior of double‐angle connections subjected to large inelastic cyclic bending. The model is purely mechanical and as input needs only the stress‐strain law of the material and the geometric properties of the connection. The connection is simulated by a series of rigid and deformable elements where the constitutive relationship of the deformable  elements is derived from the response of beam elements subjected to bending. Boundary nonlinearities arising from reversed contacts are taken into account by means of a gap element. By using the kinematic hardening rule the model is extended into the cyclic range. The comparison of numerical predictions and the experimental results proved the capability of the model to simulate the inelastic cyclic response of steel double‐angle connections subjected to reversed bending.

AB - A large proportion of North America's older building inventory is of unreinforced masonry (URM), constructed in the absence of mandatory earthquake design requirements, and unquestionably recognized as the type of construction most vulnerable to earthquakes. Awareness of this seismic hazard is relatively new in eastern North America. In addition, the nature of the seismic risk and other engineering constraints there shed a new and different perspective on the problem. This state‐of‐the‐art paper on the seismic performance of URM buildings summarizes  knowledge that has already gained some acceptance in parts of North America, and outlines current limitations. Concerns regarding the seismic performance  of existing URM buildings are formulated in an eastern North American seismicity context. The various failure modes of URM buildings or components subjected to earthquake excitation are described, and, when possible, illustrated. The state‐of‐practice as required by North American building design codes and standards is summarized. A special analytical procedure of the Uniform Code for Building Conservation, largely inspired from the Agbabian, Barnes, and Kariotis (ABK) methodology for the mitigation of seismic hazards in existing buildings, is reviewed.

AB - This paper presents results from an experimental study to determine the static response of fiberglass pretensioned beams. Three sets of underreinforced pretensioned beams 8‐ft span with cross sections of 6in.×8in.(0.15m×0.2m, 6in.×10in.(0.15m×0.25m), and 6in.×12in.(0.15m×0.3m) were tested under two‐point loading. The beams were pretensioned using three 3/8in. (9.5 mm) S‐2 glass/epoxy strands. For comparison, three identical beams pretensioned  to the same effective prestress by two 3/8in. (9.5 mm) steel strands were also tested. The results from the study indicate that the precracking response of these fiberglass pretensioned beams was near identical to the steel pretensioned beams, but its postcracking response was more flexible. Failure of some of the fiberglass pretensioned beams was accompanied by slip. Nonlinear finite‐element analysis showed good correlation with the test results. Tentative equations for estimating the failure stress and criteria for designing underreinforced beams are proposed.

AB - For nondestructive evaluation of the structural integrity of a bridge, a set of frequency‐response functions is used as signatures. The signatures are obtained by controlled vibration tests. A number of methods are presented here that are candidates for objective and effective examination of bridge signatures. These methods are based on techniques of digital signal processing and pattern recognition. A “smoother” that may be used to preprocess signatures is presented. To examine robustness of a technique, synthetic noise is added to signatures. To evaluate the effectiveness of different interrogation procedures, the method of minimum crack sensitivity measure is introduced. In this first part of the paper, the theoretical bases of the previously mentioned methods are presented. In the second part, details of bridge structures that were investigated, sample signatures, and results of interrogation using candidate methods are presented.

AB - The waveform‐recognition techniques introduced in Part I are used to detect the presence of simulated cracks in the girders of a laboratory‐size bridge as well as a highway bridge. Bridge structure is excited by using a modal hammer. Vibration response is picked up by using an accelerometer. To study the effect of noise, digital noise is added to the vibration response of the laboratory bridge. The frequency‐response function is used as the bridge signature. Each waveform‐recognition  method described in Part I, except for the cross signature assurance criterion,  is used to compare bridge signatures, and the results are evaluated and compared. When no noise is added, all the methods are successful in detecting cracks in the laboratory bridge. When synthetic noise is added, smoothing is used to reduce the noise effect. In the presence of noise, all techniques, with the exception  of the equivalent level of degradation system methods, perform well. Using a limited number of signatures from the highway bridge, the waveform chain code is capable of detecting a simulated crack.
