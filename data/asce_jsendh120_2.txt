AB - This paper summarizes the results of an experimental study that investigated  the seismic behavior of two three‐story, plain‐ and reinforced‐masonry buiding models with identical structural configuration. The measured response and observed mechanism of structural behavior have been used to analyze the load‐bearing  and energy‐dissipation capacity of each structural type. By reinforcing the masonry walls with vertical reinforcement at the borders of the walls and horizontal reinforcement in the mortar bed joints, the lateral resistance, energy‐dissipation capacity, and global ductility of the building was significantly improved. The mechanism  of the behavior of the tested models changed from the story mechanism that prevailed in the case of the plain‐masonry model to coupled shear‐wall mechanism in the case of reinforced‐masonry building model, with floor slabs and bond beams contributing to the seismic resistance of the model in the latter case.

AB - This paper presents the seismic vulnerability evaluation of a 27‐story reinforced concrete flat slab‐core building, which had not been designed for seismic forces. The evaluation is based on the FEMA‐178 handbook in conjunction with structural identification by modal testing and sensitivity analyses. Experimentally determined dynamic characteristics and lateral flexibility are used to develop and calibrate a three‐dimensional (3D) analytical model. Response spectrum sensitivity studies are conducted. The parameters that influence the degradation of the lateral stiffness under seismic loading are considered for predicting possible demand envelopes  under expected and maximum credible earthquakes. Evaluation of demands  versus capacities at the element level indicates that the building is adequate for FEMA‐178 specified forces but vulnerable to the maximum credible earthquake. Exterior slab‐column connections are found to be the weakest links in the building. Investigation of the failure behavior of the building during its implosion is also presented. Problems in the application of FEMA‐178 to buildings typical of the midwestern and eastern United States are noted, and suggestions for improvement are presented.

AB - Tests were carried out on 38150×150×200mm reinforced concrete corbels subjected to vertical loading. Steel fibers were used as shear reinforcement in 28 corbels. Parameters varied included volumes of main bars and fibrous reinforcements,  effective depth or cover to main bars, and shear span. The tests confirmed  earlier findings in that considerable improvement in ductility and strength of corbels resulted when the volume of fibers was increased. It was possible to change the mode of failure from being diagonal splitting or shear to flexure, when corbels were reinforced with relatively low volume of main bars. To estimate the flexural strength of reinforced concrete corbels subjected to vertical load, two methods, using a flexural model and a truss model, are presented. Comparison between the experimental and calculated strengths of corbels show that the two values obtained in each case are in satisfactory agreement.

AB - A construction technique that uses steel decking as permanent and integral shuttering for the sides and soffits of reinforced concrete beams is described. Experimental tests on large‐scale profiled beams have shown that the side steel decking can substantially increase both the flexural strength and the ductility, as well as the shear strength of the beam. Furthermore, previous theoretical research has shown that the side steel decking can substantially reduce deflections due to creep and shrinkage and allow increases in span/depth ratios of about 20%. However,  the behavior of this form of composite construction can be affected by local buckling of the steel decking and the strength of the shear bond at the interface between the decking and concrete. Simple design procedures are developed to prevent local buckling of the steel decking before the ultimate strength of the beam is reached, and to determine the flexural strength of the profiled beam for various strengths of the shear bond.

AB - Viscoelastic dampers have been adopted for improving the seismic resistance of structures. One of the major difficulties is the modeling of the temperature effect of dampers on the structural responses during earthquakes. This paper is aimed at the influence of the temperature on the energy‐absorbing features of the viscoelastic dampers. Not only the capacity of the energy dissipation but also the stiffness of the dampers are dependent on ambient temperatures. That leads to quite different behavior of the structure at different temperature levels while the viscoelastic dampers are added to the structure. In this study the behavior of a 10‐story building equipped with viscoelastic dampers is examined while it is subjected to earthquake ground motions. Numerical results show that the energy‐absorbing capacity and stiffness of the viscoelastic damper decreases with increasing the ambient temperature. The responses, including displacements and stresses, of the given examples are significantly reduced while viscoelastic dampers are added to it. The efficiency of the added dampers on the reduction of the structural responses decreases at higher temperatures.

AB - Local buckling behavior of cold‐formed steel wall studs with rectangular web perforations is investigated experimentally and analytically. Stub column tests on short sections not subject to overall buckling are examined. The unified effective width approach to local buckling presented in the 1986 Specification for the Design of Cold‐Formed Steel Structural Members of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) is modified to model the perforated section. The web is idealized as two unstiffened elements extending the length of the member. In addition, the current AISI stub column‐based empirical approach and a “simplified” method used by some designers are examined. In the simplified approach, perforation effects are ignored unless the perforation is located in a portion of the web that is at least partially effective. Comparisons made between predictions of post‐buckling strengths using the unstiffened strip approach and the stub column test results show the unstiffened strip model to be a useful design methodology.

AB - Applications of nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) to complete structures have been limited. The study reported in this paper examined the reliability of NLFEA to assess strength and stiffness of a three‐span reinforced concrete slab bridge that was loaded to failure in the field. The researchers at the University of Cincinnati and Delft University of Technology, in The Netherlands, conducted preliminary analyses that were then compared to the measured responses. These analyses indicate a significant influence of tensile behavior of concrete in the postcracking range, and the level of slab membrane force that is directly affected by the assumed horizontal support conditions at the slab‐abutment connection. Reasonable correlation of the measured responses was possible by removing the horizontal restraints at the slab‐abutment connections. However, such models do not simulate the observed behavior at the abutments. The shear keys at the slab‐abutment connections would not permit free horizontal movements, yet the slab can rotate about the shear keys. The resulting rotation would reduce the membrane force that can be developed. An improved model incorporating this behavior produced better results than the original model assuming full horizontal restraints at the abutments.

AB - A formulation for modeling links in eccentrically braced steel frames (EBFs) subjected to random inelastic cyclic loading is presented. The formulation is plasticity‐based, and includes shear and flexural yielding. In addition, combined isotropic and kinematic shear strain‐hardening effects are accounted for, as well as flexural strain hardening. The formulation is shown to accurately predict the behavior of test specimens involving short links. Inelastic seismic analysis of EBFs with short links was conducted to illustrate the effect of link‐modeling assumptions on EBF response. The analysis results show that link strain hardening can have a pronounced effect on EBF response, leading to larger member forces in braces and columns attached to the links. Furthermore, combined flexural and shear yielding occurred in the links adjacent to columns, indicating the need to include these types of inelastic deformations in the link‐modeling formulation. Finally, the use in the analysis of viscous damping in the link was found to cause excessive axial forces to develop in braces and columns adjacent to yielded links. To reduce this effect, a form of nonproportional viscous damping is illustrated.

AB - Two bridge superstructural systems and two other floor systems are constructed and tested under concentric static loads using fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) shapes. Structural performance of individual FRP components is established through three‐ and four‐point bending tests. Structural efficiency of each system is analyzed in terms of joint efficiency, transverse load distribution, composite action between FRP components, and maximum deflections and stresses. Theoretical prediction of system performance is conducted by the orthotropic plate theory, finite‐element method, and a method to predict beam stiffnesses based on simplified classical lamination theory (CLT). The correlation between theoretical and experimental results is good and reveals that the simplified CLT can be effectively used in future designs. The bridge and floor systems tested herein had undergone deflections smaller or at the most equal to the allowable (L/1,000 and L/360, respectively) for loads larger than the corresponding allowable loads (72 kN and 3.8 kN, respectively).

AB - A finite element approach to calculate directly the critical wind velocity for the nonlinear lateral‐torsional buckling instability of long‐span cable‐stayed bridges under the displacement‐dependent wind loads is presented. An analytical modeling of wind‐induced lateral‐torsional buckling is formulated taking into account the three components of displacement‐dependent wind loads as well as geometric nonlinearity. A combination of the eigenvalue analysis and the updated bound algorithm for wind velocity is applied to automatically calculate the critical wind velocity. The results show that the incorporation of the three components of displacement‐dependent wind loads as well as the geometric nonlinearity in the analytical modeling of the lateral‐torsional buckling instability results in significant reduction in the critical wind velocity compared with both the conventional non‐linear torsional divergence and linearized lateral‐torsional buckling.

AB - One major serviceability consideration in modern buildings is excessive floor vibrations due to occupant activities. Floor vibrations are becoming a more important design consideration with the use of high‐strength, light‐weight materials in building structures, longer floor spans, and more flexible framing systems. Floor systems in shopping malls, pedestrian walkways and concourses, and gymnasiums are relatively light and susceptible to vibration problems. Methods for accurate prediction of these vibrations and evaluation of floor systems are not readily available to the design community. An investigation is made into the characteristics of crowd‐induced loads. These characteristics include the density of the crowd, randomness of crowd movement, crowd activity, and temporal interaction between individuals. Analytical procedures are developed to determine the influence of each load characteristic on the dynamic response of floor systems. Design guidelines are developed for floors in malls, gymnasiums, and walkways subject to crowd‐induced loads.

AB - A method of analysis of instantaneous and time‐dependent stresses and strains in prestressed noncracked cross sections of curved members is presented. The procedure is an extension of an existing method of analysis that applies to straight members. The analysis is based on the assumptions that plane cross sections remain plane after deformation and that stress‐strain relations for concrete and steel are linear. After prestress transfer, the changes at any fiber in concrete and steel strain are equal. Effects of creep and shrinkage of concrete and relaxation of prestressed steel are accounted for, without the need to precede the analysis by an estimate of prestress loss.

AB - To investigate the elastic compressive behavior of gusset plate connections, eight tests are performed with gusset plate thickness, gusset plate size, and out‐of‐plane restraint of the diagonal bracing member as test parameters. The effects of the framing members on the gusset plate are neglected in the testing program. It is found that the primary failure mode of gusset plate connections loaded in compression is gusset plate buckling. The buckling can be classified as sway buckling and local buckling depending on the out‐of‐plane restraint of the diagonal bracing member. The elastic buckling strength of the specimens is affected significantly by the gusset plate thickness and the out‐of‐plane restraint of the bracing member. The finite‐element analysis by the program ANSYS gives reasonable predictions of the buckling strength of the gusset plate connection. A parametric study was performed using ANSYS. It is found from the parametric study that splicing member should always be extended toward the beam and column boundary as close as possible in order to improve the buckling strength of the connection. The parametric study also indicates that increasing the thickness of the splice plate the buckling strength of the gusset plate increases significantly. Therefore, the use of tee‐sections or back to back angles as the splicing member are recommended.

AB - Steel‐framed buildings are typically constructed using steel‐deck‐reinforced concrete floor slabs. The in‐plane, or diaphragm, strength and stiffness of the floor system are frequently utilized in the lateral‐load‐resisting system design. However, design provisions for composite diaphragms do not exist in any U.S. specification, and limited experimental data are available to assess the behavior of these systems. This paper presents the results of an experimental research program in which 32 full‐size composite diaphragms were loaded to failure. Partial results from a large series of elemental tests performed in conjunction with the full‐size tests are also presented. Typical composite diaphragm limit states are described, and the controlling limit state for each of the full‐size tests is indicated. The results presented in this paper provide background for a companion paper, in which the development of an analytical procedure to determine the strength and stiffness of the experimental composite diaphragms is presented. The procedure is based, in part, on results of finite‐element modeling of the experimental diaphragms. A description of the models and the results are also given in the companion paper.

(The companion paper presents experimental results and behavioral aspects, including the limit states observed in the test program, observed failure loads and initial stiffness values.) The research program included analytical studies in the form of finite‐element analyses and the development of expressions to determine strength and stiffness. The nonlinear behavior of arc‐spot welds, headed shear studs and deck‐concrete interface was incorporated in the finite‐element models. Comparisons between the finite‐element studies and experimental results are presented in this paper. The analytical procedure, based partly on the finite‐element results, provides expressions for calculating the strength and stiffness of composite diaphragms in a cantilever configuration. The strength calculations are based on the three limit states that are of practical significance; diagonal tension failure of the concrete slab, edge connector failure, or shear‐transfer mechanism failure. The second two limit states are dependent on force distributions at the perimeter framing members, which are determined from the finite‐element analyses.

AB - A procedure is presented for evaluating building‐code provisions for accidental torsion from analysis of earthquake‐induced motions of nominally symmetric‐plan buildings. This procedure is used to analyze the motions of three buildings recorded during recent California earthquakes. Two alternative approaches to evaluate the code accidental torsion provisions are developed. The first One considers the response histories of base shear and base torque in the building, and the second, the “actual” forces in the structural elements during the earthquake. The results show that base rotational motions cause between 25% and 45% of the total accidental torsion in the buildings. They also demonstrate that the accidental torsional moments specified by the Uniform Building Code are sufficient in representing the torsion in the recorded motions of the three buildings. Further, it is shown that accidental torsion need not be considered in the design of two of the three buildings studied. This observation, however, may not necessarily apply to other structures, such as buildings with torsional vibration periods much longer than their lateral vibration periods.

AB - The theory of structural optimization has advanced considerably during the last three decades as is illustrated by the vast number of published books, surveys, and papers on the subject. On the other hand, application of optimization into practice is comparatively modest and reserved for special problems solved by optimization experts. The paper attempts to factually establish the extent of practical use of optimization in structural engineering to date and to examine the possible causes for its rather limited and slow adoption. The first objective is achieved by documenting the state of the practice and existing trends. This is based on the presentation of a broad catalog of some 500 published optimization examples, organized with the designers' needs in mind. As for the second objective, it is suggested that the complexities of mathematical optimization represent a major obstacle for the structural designer, even when he is motivated to use optimization. Accordingly, it is proposed that design optimization be considered from a structural rather than mathematical angle, particularly with regard to problem identification.

AB - Two quarter‐scale, continuous, longitudinally and transversely posttensioned,  two‐lane, voided‐slab‐bridge models—one straight and the other curved in plan—were tested to determine the service‐load response under symmetric placement  of simulated truck loading according to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Each model was 2.0 m (6 ft 7 in.) wide, with two equal spans of 8.0 m (26.27 ft) measured along the centerline. The curved model subtended an arc of 40° on a radius of curvature of 22.92 m (75.2 ft). The voided slab bridge was idealized as an orthotropic plate and its elastic response determined from a two‐dimensional finite element analysis using isoparametric, quadrilateral shell elements. The commercially available computer program ANSYS was used to conduct the analysis. This paper presents comparisons of predictions from the finite element analysis with test results for deflections, reactions,  and stresses. The results show reasonable agreement for the straight model but not for the curved model, where the correlation is poorer. This suggests that the equivalent orthotropic plate parameters proposed in the literature need to be modified for applications involving curved structures.
