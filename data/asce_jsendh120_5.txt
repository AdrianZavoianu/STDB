AB - While carrying out an approximate lateral‐load analysis of moment‐resisting tank stagings, it is normal to assume a shear distribution in the columns; this leads to significant inaccuracies. It is shown that due to symmetry and simple configuration, such an assumption need not be made. In the proposed procedure, axial force in columns is obtained assuming it is proportional to the distance of the column from the bending axis of staging, and taking into account the shift in inflection point in the end panels due to the flexibility of girders. The rest of the unknown forces are computed by using equations of static equilibrium and by assuming the location of the points of inflection. It is possible to obtain simple closed‐form expressions for design forces and moments in the members. Such expressions may prove useful in approximate analysis of the tank stagings. Analysis of four practical stagings shows that the proposed procedure is significantly more accurate than the procedures still prevalent in many books and that the accuracy obtained by the proposed procedure is adequate for design.

AB - The prediction of the ultimate load capacity of composite skew bridges with slab‐on steel I‐girders is required for the ultimate limit state design of such bridges. In this paper, the prediction of the most probable yield‐line patterns of failure under different cases of loadings is presented. The prediction is based on a parametric study (companion paper) as well as on laboratory test results on simply supported and continuous two‐span skew composite bridge models. Good agreement is shown between the theoretical and experimental results. The results show that the skew‐angle‐bridge‐aspect ratio, as well as the type of connection between different elements of the composite bridge are the main factors in predicting the collapse load and the failure pattern of the bridge. The degree of composite action between the diaphragms and deck slab is also shown to have an influence on the ultimate collapse load of the bridge. A method relating American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) truck loading to the collapse load is presented. The derived equations can be readily used for either designing skew composite bridges or analyzing existing ones. A worked design example is presented.

AB - The prediction of the most probable failure pattern of a bridge under different cases of loading is necessary in order to determine its ultimate load capacity. In skew bridges, various parameters influence the determination of the minimum collapse load given by equations derived in the companion paper. In this paper, a parametric study is performed to relate the main design parameters and the geometries of the failure patterns for the minimum collapse load. Both eccentric and concentric critical loadings are considered. The effects of skew, aspect ratio, number of girders, interaction between diaphragms and main girders, and the number of loaded lanes on the failure patterns are studied and presented for each case of loading. Results are presented for both simply supported and continuous two‐span skew composite bridges.

AB - The present paper discusses the use of second‐order inelastic analysis for designing steel‐frame structures. In particular, the elastic‐plastic hinge method is discussed and its accuracy is examined. The elastic plastic‐hinge analysis does not always represent accurately the inelastic behavior of a member, since it does not account for distributed plasticity and initial residual‐stress effects. One way to account for these effects in the analysis is to apply a set of notional lateral loads that are computed based on the gravity loads acting on the stories of the frame. The performance of this analysis approach is compared with the results from conventional elastic plastic‐hinge and refined plastic‐zone solutions. The goal is to illustrate the acceptability of the notional‐load plastic‐hinge method for use in predicting the maximum strengths of steel frames and their members. Finally, the design implication of this approach is explained, and its extension for the analysis and design of multistory and multibay frames is discussed.

AB - After obtaining shear force, which creates unit lateral displacement in columns of a framed system, from an assumed deformation shape, the lateral‐stiffness value of a related story is obtained. By employing these lateral‐stiffness values, a system lateral‐stiffness matrix, which is in banded matrix form, can be established easily. By using this banded matrix, established through the aforementioned method, natural angular frequency and characteristic model shape can be easily obtained. Also presented is a method to calculate the effective length of framed columns by using c factors, which depend on the stiffnesses of columns and girders of the framed system. First‐mode values calculated by the presented method are compatible with classic shear‐beam solutions and exact solutions. Furthermore, results obtained from the application of c factors, giving effective length factors for various end‐connection conditions at the far ends of columns, are on the conservative side compared with exact values.

AB - Field observation of damage on several old cooling towers poses the problem of their aging process. This latter may be a phenomenon linked not only with the deterioration of reinforced concrete as material, but also with possibility of buckling. The present study is an attempt to analyze and to interpret observed in‐situ deterioration by means of parametric digital calculations, using experimental results obtained in laboratory. The origin of the deformed shapes of the cooling towers that were analyzed is then identified. This analysis emphasizes the predominant role played by self‐weight in the mechanical behavior of the cooling towers. Self‐weight is the cause of the multimodal deformed shapes observed which were initiated during the construction phase. These same deformed shapes encourage cracking by initiation of a significant degree of local bending, particularly in the circumferential direction which causes meridional cracking; a phenomenon which has been corroborated by in‐situ observation.

AB - Experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to predict the fire resistance of circular hollow steel columns filled with bar‐reinforced concrete. A mathematical model to calculate the temperatures, deformations, and fire resistance of the columns is presented. Calculated results are compared with those measured. The results indicate that the model is capable of predicting the fire resistance of circular hollow steel columns, filled with bar‐reinforced concrete, with an accuracy that is adequate for practical purposes. The model enables the expansion of data on the fire resistance of circular concrete‐filled steel columns, which at present consists predominantly of data for columns filled with plain concrete, with that for columns filled with bar‐reinforced concrete. Using the model, the fire resistance of circular concrete‐filled steel columns can be evaluated for any value of the significant parameters, such as load, column‐section dimensions, column length, and percentage of reinforcing steel without the necessity of testing.

AB - The behavior of cracks under cyclic shear loading is characterized by a considerable irreversible damage of the crack faces. Therefore the response of cracks to reversed and alternative actions can only be well described if load‐history effects are taken into account. A model is presented that makes it possible to explain and predict the behavior of cracks under cyclic loading. This model reflects the actual behavior using a realistic implementation of the concrete properties.

AB - The stochastic modeling of construction loads on newly poured slabs during construction of multistory concrete buildings is presented in this paper. The purpose of the study is to calculate the equivalent uniformly distributed load (EUDL), i.e., the uniform load that will produce (statistically) the same load effect in formwork members as the actual live loads. To achieve this objective the spatial correlation of construction live loads as well as the influence surfaces of various formwork member load effects must be determined. In this study, the construction live load covariance function is modeled as an exponential function. Influence surfaces for formwork shore axial forces and stringer bending moments and shear forces are also investigated for several formwork designs. The statistical moments and a distribution function for construction live load EUDLs are presented. The 0.99 fractiles of EUDLs are compared with the current design load specifications for slab formwork design. Load reduction equations are presented for slab formwork design loads.

AB - Live loads on newly poured slabs during construction of multistory concrete buildings are investigated. These loads include the weight of workers, equipment, and materials stored on slabs varying in age from less than one day to about three days. In each project that was surveyed data about various objects stored on the floor under construction were collected. These data included the weight, size, contact area with the floor, and location relative to a coordinate system. Examples of materials and equipment stored on newly poured slabs are bundles of reinforcement, packs of lumber and plywood, stacks of formwork frame, gang tool boxes, storage boxes, dumpsters, air compressors, generators, and finishers. The weights of various objects were determined either by the inventory method or by direct weighing. The required load data were collected by a survey of over 22 concrete building projects in 12 different cities. Since the standard deviation of live load is area‐dependent, the collected load data were used to calculate statistical moments for six different averaging areas ranging from 0.093 m2 to 58 m2. Several different probability models are investigated for the observed data. The observed formwork live loads are modeled with a mixed distribution with a discrete part at zero load intensity and a continuous part for nonzero loads. Both gamma and Weibull distributions provided good fit to the nonzero data.

AB - By the use of the structural membrane theory, an effective and accurate method for determining bending moments in flat plates is developed. This involves using a three‐dimensional model, which removes the inherent limitations of the two‐dimensional frame representation of plates as recommended in the ACI 318 code. For square and rectangular layouts, this method yields excellent agreement with existing test data. The method makes it possible to analyze plates with triangular, hexagonal, and other regular column arrangements. It furthermore furnishes an approximate design for plates with irregular column layouts. Originally developed for the design of thin shells supported on irregularly spaced columns, the structural membrane theory provides accurate results for similarly supported flat plates. With extreme simplicity in both input and output files, combined with limited requirements for computer memory and computer time, it promises to become a popular tool for the practicing engineer.

AB - The application of the membrane/plate analogy and the structural‐membrane theory combined in the analysis of flat plates in the companion paper is explained and tested through a series of design examples. Where the ACI 318‐89 code is applicable or where actual tests are available, the results have been compared. In case of flat plates supported by triangular or hexagonal column layouts, the results from the new approach have been compared to those obtained by finite‐element analysis. The analysis of a plate supported on a hexagonal‐column layout has been presented in details using the new approach. An example of an approximate design approach for the design of flat plates supported on randomly spaced columns is outlined. The resulting plate moments are represented as continuous mathematical functions, in difference to the results obtained from finite‐element analysis. Consequently, the new method allows direct calculation of the deflections throughout the plate.

AB - Channel sections in flexure, when not attached to deck or sheeting, are designed according to the American Iron and Steel Institute's equations for lateral‐torsional buckling. These formulas assume an unbraced length with equal and opposite end moments, and only torsional restraints at the braces. These formulas tend to overestimate the buckling strength in some cases, especially where there are two or more intermediate braces within a span length. The reason for this is that the failure mode may be something other than lateral‐torsional buckling. In fact, tests have shown that highly braced members usually fail by distortional buckling of the flange‐lip intersection at a braced point. The present paper reports a series of experiments on channels with various bracing schemes and offers a mathematical prediction model for the ultimate strength of a channel in flexure.

AB - The fatigue reliability of steel‐bridge components is evaluated. The most commonly used S‐N curve‐based American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) method is considered first. The limit‐state equation and the uncertainty associated with all the basic random variables are quantified. Using the advanced first‐order second‐moment method, the corresponding probability of failure is calculated in terms of the reliability index. It is observed that the reliability index is very similar to other design problems involving steel structures. Since the AASHTO approach cannot incorporate the crack‐size information even if it is known at the time of evaluation, an alternative linear‐elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) method is proposed. The corresponding limit‐state equation and the basic variables are identified, and the uncertainties associated with them are quantified. The reliability index is calculated similarly. For comparison purposes, the reliability indexes according to the AASHTO and LEFM approaches are evaluated for full‐penetration butt welds in the tension flange of a steel‐box girder used in a public‐transportation system. The reliability indexes are almost identical, at least around the design life of 50 years. The LEFM approach still retains the simplicity of the AASHTO method, yet it is extremely powerful and efficient and can incorporate information on crack size as inspection results become available. It is proposed that the LEFM can be used as an alternative to the AASHTO method in the fatigue‐damage evaluation of steel bridges. The LEFM method is extended in the companion paper to incorporate information from inspections and the corresponding updating of the underlying reliability.

AB - A reliability‐based fatigue‐damage‐evaluation procedure developed in the companion paper is extended in this paper to incorporate information from nondestructive inspections (NDI). Since inspections are required at regular intervals, the results from these inspections can be used for fatigue maintenance of steel bridges. The sensitivity and capability of some of the inspection methods, including ultrasonic inspection, are investigated. Inspection information is beneficial; however, it adds uncertainty to the fatigue‐evaluation process. The detectability and the accuracy are the two additional sources of uncertainty in the NDI. The uncertainties in them are quantified. The detection events are classified into three cases, no crack detection, crack detection but without size measurement, and crack detection with the crack‐size measurement. Using the information from k inspections, the distributions of the basic random variables and the corresponding reliability index are updated. Using the information on the updated reliability index, a decision can be made on what to do next, in terms of reducing the next scheduled inspection interval, or whether to repair, replace, or do nothing. The procedure is explained with the help of an example. It is concluded that the inspection results can be used to maintain the fatigue‐damage integrity of steel bridges. Fatigue damage‐control curves are also proposed for everyday use.

AB - Most of the current design guidelines for metal box‐type culverts have been developed based on finite‐element analysis, in which the soil is modeled with plane strain and the culvert is represented with beam‐column elements. These culverts are generally fabricated with shallow‐depth‐corrugation plates and additional stiffening ribs. A recent innovation in the box‐type culverts involves the use of a deeply corrugated section without additional stiffening members. There is a concern that the corrugations may flatten under load, reducing the resistance to bending and possibly becoming unstable. The response of a 140 mm (5.5 in.) deep‐corrugated steel plate, measured in a field test of a box‐type culvert, indicates that the plate can be analyzed using simple‐beam theory. Strain in the plate and changes in the corrugation depth were recorded during the backfill process and when subjected to simulated‐service loads. Since the results show that the deeply corrugated section does not distort significantly under design loads, treatment of the plate as a beam is valid. However, because the culvert is a permanent installation under State Route 554, it was not possible to test the ultimate‐bending capacity of the deep‐corrugated section.

AB - An automatic procedure for spatial modeling and inclusion of straight segments of embedded reinforcement in a mesh of solid‐isoparametric elements representing concrete is presented. This procedure alleviates the laborious task of generating the input data for the embedded‐bar elements in three‐dimensional finite‐element analysis of reinforced‐concrete structures, particularly when modifications/refinements to the concrete‐element mesh are made, and/or reinforcement arrangement is changed. Each straight segment of reinforcement is identified by the coordinates of its two end points, and its intersections with the faces of solid elements are determined. The stiffness of each composite reinforced‐concrete element can then be computed using an inverse‐mapping procedure to obtain the coordinates of the integration points along the reinforcement element(s) in the concrete parent element axes.

AB - Thin‐glass window‐glass plates undergo deflections 10 times their thickness before they fail by brittle fracture and, hence, a complete‐elastic large‐deflection analysis of glass plates was found to be necessary to assess the behavior and design of thin‐glass plates. The von Karman nonlinear‐plate theory has been found to be applicable for such analysis. Here, the analysis of axisymmetric‐circular plates subjected to uniformly distributed pressures is made using an iterative procedure. As deflections become large, the maximum stress in the plate is no longer at the center of the plate. The governing differential equations are nondimensionalized, and in the nondimensional maximum‐deflection, stresses are presented in terms of nondimensional‐applied pressure in graphical as well as tabular forms.
