AB - The buckling of the component plates of structural sections may be avoided by ensuring that their breadth-to-thickness ( b
/t) ratios are less than the specified limit for the prevailing loading condition. Limiting  b
/t ratios apply to plates that are free to buckle onto either side of their initial plane. For sections that are filled or encased with concrete it is likely that the component plates can only buckle away from the interface with this material. The derivation of  b
/t ratios for this class of plates is presented in this paper. The energy method is used to equate the work required to load the plate, to the work required to deform the plate into a buckled shape. Orthotropic plate theory and the flow theory of plasticity are used to evaluate  b
/t ratios for plates subjected to uniaxial compression, combinations of bending and axial loading, and shear. The resulting  b
/t ratios are higher than those for plates not restrained by intimate contact with concrete. The benefits of using infilling or encasement to improve the structural behavior of steel sections are also discussed.

AB - This paper is concerned with the plastic-collapse analysis of structural steel I-section members subject to torsion. It proposes and exemplifies a method of plastic-collapse analysis that is much simpler than elastic analysis. The load factor at plastic collapse is obtained from the sum of the independent load factors for uniform-torsion plastic collapse and warping-torsion plastic collapse. This plastic-analysis method allows a method of plastic design to be used for torsion that is much simpler and more economical than first yield design. The use of plastic analysis and design will facilitate the design of steel torsion members and lead to more economical structures.

AB - Slender plates are used in a variety of structural engineering applications because of their high strength-to-weight ratio and their postbuckling reserve of stiffness and strength. However, relatively large out-of-plane displacements may be induced by in-plane loading close to or exceeding the buckling load, which in turn induces relatively high secondary bending stresses at welded plate boundaries. Under repeated loading the combined state of membrane and secondary bending stresses can result in fatigue cracking and premature failure. A series of fatigue tests on slender plate-girder webs subjected to repeated shear loading is described. Details of the test results presented include the load ranges and number of load cycles to fatigue failure, the location and extent of fatigue cracks, out-of-plane web deflections, and stress ranges at fatigue crack locations. The theoretical prediction of stress ranges at potential fatigue crack locations and fatigue-resistant design procedures are also discussed.

AB - The effective length of the perimeter weld around the branch member in axially loaded rectangular hollow structural section (HSS), T, and X connections is examined experimentally. By means of 16 full-scale connection tests, which were designed to be weld-critical, guidelines for the effectiveness of the heel, toe, and side welds are developed in terms of the principal connection parameters. It is found that more of the weld perimeter is effective for lower branch member to chord member angles, and more weld is effective for smaller width branch members (relative to the chord member size). The effective weld length recommendations advocated are shown to result in weld designs with an adequate level of safety, and revisions to some existing guidelines are proposed.

AB - The impact of model uncertainty on the damage-prediction accuracy of a nondestructive damage-detection technique when applied to a model plate girder is assessed. First, a damage-detection algorithm to locate and size damage from few mode shapes of structures is outlined. Next, locations and magnitudes of damage in the model plate girder are predicted by using the damage-detection algorithm. Finally, damage-prediction accuracy for the model plate girder is estimated as a function of model uncertainties that are most likely or exist in the damage-detection procedure of the model plate girder. By applying the approach to the model plate girder, it is observed that damage can be confidently located with a relatively small localization error and a relatively small false-negative (i.e., missing detection of true damage locations) error but a relatively large false-positive (i.e., prediction of locations that are not damaged) error. It is also observed that severity of damage can be estimated with a relatively large error.

AB - This paper describes the results of an extensive study on the seismic behavior of a viscoelastically damped structure under mild and strong earthquake ground motions. Shaking-table studies were conducted on a 2/5-scale five-story steel model with added viscoelastic (VE) dampers under various ambient temperatures, damper-placement cases, and earthquake intensities. Three types of VE dampers distinguished by dimensions and viscoelastic materials designed to provide the structure with similar damping ratios at room temperature were used. Analytical studies were carried out to predict the equivalent damping ratios and seismic response of the viscoelastically damped structure. Experimental results show that the VE dampers are effective in attenuating seismic structural response under mild and strong earthquake ground motions. Numerical results show that the structural damping and structural response with added VE dampers can be easily and accurately calculated by the proposed analytical methods. The methods are readily available to practical applications.

AB - A study of the resultants of the inertia and drag-force intensities induced by waves on offshore structures is made. The relationships between these resultants and the corresponding modal forces that govern the structural response are examined, and information and concepts are reported that elucidate the main factors that control such forces. The demonstration that the inertia and drag components of the modal forces can be expressed in terms of the sea-surface kinematics is a distinguishing feature of the study. More specifically, it is demonstrated that, in deep waters, the inertia modal force is particularly influenced by the horizontal water-particle displacement evaluated at the still-water level. The corresponding drag modal force is shown to be controlled by the square of the vertical water-particle displacement computed at the same level. The analyses for the wave excitations presented in this paper advance the understanding of their characteristics and are potentially useful for the development of efficient design-oriented procedures for offshore platforms. Analyses for the wave-induced structural response are also presented that further enhance the usefulness of the reported information and concepts.

AB - The main change in the torsional provisions of the 1991 edition of the  Uniform Building Code
 (UBC) from the 1979 UBC edition is the need to amplify the accidental eccentricity for torsionally flexible structural systems. This paper evaluates the consequences of the change on the strength design requirement and the ductility demand on the edge lateral force-resisting elements in torsionally unbalanced structural systems, which are designed based on the two editions of the UBC code. The major improvement of the 1991 UBC is its ability to limit the additional ductility demand on the stiff-edge element of a torsionally unbalanced system to an acceptable level, even when the system is torsionally flexible.

AB - A full-scale five-story steel-frame structure with added viscoelastic (VE) dampers is studied experimentally and analytically. The experimental program includes free-vibration and harmonic forced-vibration tests. Dynamic scaling relations between the full-scale and 2/5-scale models with VE dampers are presented. Test results confirm that damping in the full-scale structure can be significantly increased by incorporating relatively small VE dampers. The modal strain energy method used to estimate the structural damping for the 2/5-scale model structure is also applicable to the full-scale structure. The damper design procedure developed from the 2/5-scale model can also be used for the full-scale structure. This study provides an important base for utilizing the extensive data generated from the reduced scale-model tests for incorporating VE dampers into full-scale structures.

AB - We present distributed algorithms for the finite-element (FE) analysis of large structures on a loosely coupled multicomputer such as a cluster of inexpensive workstations. The focus is on the development of a coarse-grained preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solver based on the element-by-element approach to solve the resulting system of linear equations. To account for the slow communication speed of the ethernet network connecting workstations, techniques such as redundant computations to eliminate communication, efficient data distribution, and algorithmic restructuring to reduce communication frequency have been developed to coarsen task granularity. We present a data distribution and data movement strategy based on set  theory. Due to the general nature of the data distribution scheme, the algorithms are versatile and can be applied to the analysis of unstructured FE domains consisting of a combination of various types of elements.

AB - The implementation of distributed algorithms for the finite-element analysis of structures developed in a 1995 paper by Adeli and Kumar is presented here. A common class of object-oriented data structures has been developed for generation and display of data distribution among the workstations and interprocess communication scheme. The algorithms presented are robust and versatile and have been applied to analysis of large structures with complicated and unstructured topology. In spite of the high latency and low bandwidth of the ethernet networks, an overall parallelization efficiency in the range of 75–90% is obtained on a cluster of six IBM RS/6000 workstations for large structural models with a few thousand elements. Research suggests that with the emergence of high-speed communication networks, workstation clusters are likely to emerge as an effective alternative to high-performance computing in structural engineering due to their cost/performance advantage over the current generation of supercomputers.

AB - To analyze and design long-span soil-metal structures and other structures involving soil or reinforced soil, it is important to estimate accurately the soil properties. Triaxial tests are carried out on reinforced as well as unreinforced Lake Erie sand specimens. A hyperbolic stress-strain relation is proposed to represent the soil elastic properties. Expressions are deduced to evaluate the modulus of elasticity of the soil as well as the coefficient of soil reaction that is required for the proper design of soil-metal structures. The proposed expressions are valid for both reinforced and unreinforced soils. A simplified finite-element model is presented for the analysis of long-span unreinforced and reinforced soil-metal structures. Results from the simplified model are compared to those from a plane-strain finite-element analysis. The results are also verified using results obtained from tests carried out on reduced-scale models.

AB - In gravity dams, crack growth is inhibited by gravitational effects; thus, correct model testing can only be accomplished in a centrifuge where the gravitational field is inversely proportional to the scale. Following an overview of centrifugal testing, this paper reports on the first centrifuge testing of concrete gravity dam models. Test results are then contrasted with numerical predictions using fracture-mechanics-based finite-element analysis. The paper concludes with recommendations for further investigation on this new and innovative testing technique.

The nodal locations are treated as continuous design variables using the hybrid natural approach for shape optimal design. Element connectivity and boundary conditions are treated as Boolean design variables in the context of topology design. The traditional genetic algorithm is modified to handle the problem formulation. Simple concepts are used to accelerate convergence and reduce the computational effort. Numerical examples are solved to illustrate the proposed methodology. Several conclusions drawn from the research results are presented along with some thoughts on computational strategies.

AB - A method to predict the degree of translational-torsional coupling of mixed-bent-type multistory building structures subject to dynamic loading is presented. The method is based on the treatment of nonproportionate structures as a particular class of regular proportionate ones, and on the generalized representation of asymmetric structures by shear-flexure, torsion-warping cantilevers. The method is applicable to structures consisting of any combination of walls and frames that are uniform over their height. The concept and location of the significant centers of reference, such as the shear centers and the centers of resistance, of mixed-bent-type multistory building structures are clarified, and the significance of the coupled-period ratio for the assessment of the coupling effect is discussed. The derivation of the method, and comparisons of results with those obtained by three-dimensional (3D) finite-element dynamic analyses of discrete member models, are given. A worked example illustrates the application of the method.

AB - Seismic response of single-span simply supported and continuous slab-on-girder steel bridges is studied. Linear elastic and nonlinear inelastic analyses are conducted for various ground-acceleration inputs. Bearings with higher stiffnesses that are closer to the edge of the deck are found to attract larger forces than other bearings, whereas bearings with small stiffness attract almost equal forces regardless of the width of the bridge. Assuming that the anchors of otherwise stable bearings are severed, sliding of the bridges is also investigated. It is found that narrower bridges with longer spans may have considerable sliding displacements and may fall off their supports if adequate seat width is not provided. Wider bridges with shorter spans can survive rather severe earthquakes, even more so in eastern North America. It is found that if bearings are not damaged, 2- and 3-lane continuous bridges with two spans of up to 40 and 50 m each, respectively, are capable to resist earthquakes with 0.4 g
 peak acceleration without any damage to columns. However, bridges with only about 80% of these spans can survive similarly intense earthquakes if the bearings are damaged.

AB - Reinforced concrete members sometimes experience brittle failures, characterized by a sudden decrease in load capacity. Such brittle failures include shear failure and flexural crushing failure without yielding of flexural reinforcement. Usually, it is very difficult to obtain analytical predictions of the brittle failures and to verify the failure mechanism. The objective of this paper is to investigate nonlinear numerical methods for predicting complete member behavior at target displacements including brittle failure, and to investigate the propagation of cracking and crushing related to the brittle failure. In particular, the validity of an arc-length method and a displacement-control method will be investigated, using existing monotonic and cyclic cracked concrete models proposed by the writers.

AB - A finite-element formulation for modeling flexible connection behavior in space frames composed of thin-walled members is presented. The finite-element model is based on a distributed linear spring representation over the physical contact area of the connection that is capable of representing translational, rotational, and warping deformations of the connection. Second-order geometric and nonlinear moment-rotation response of the connection is considered. An updated Lagrangian formulation is used to model second-order geometric nonlinear effects. A Ramberg-Osgood representation is used to model the nonlinear moment-rotation connection behavior. Details for transforming the resulting stiffness equations for connection-to-member eccentricities are included. Results for a cubic, portal space frame composed of I-section and C-section members are presented to demonstrate the versatility of the developed element.

AB - The reliability of existing reinforced-concrete flat-slab buildings, designed and detailed to resist gravity loads only, was studied for punching failure at connections under earthquake-type loading. Two flat-slab buildings, three and 10 stories in height, designed according to the ACI 318-56 building code, were used in the nonlinear dynamic analysis and reliability calculations. Results from previous experimental results on the seismic resistance of slab-column connections were employed to establish the effective slab widths, unbalanced moment-transfer capacity of connections, and their punching strength. The member dimensions, material strengths, and live load were treated as random variables and the effect of model uncertainty was included in the calculations of reliability indices. Random earthquake time histories were generated with the Kanai-Tajimi power spectrum. The limit-state function was based on the punching failure capacity of the interior slab-column connections. Based on the reliability analysis, the probability of failure of existing flat-slab buildings are presented for different soil conditions and peak ground accelerations varying from 0.05 g
 to 0.2 g

AB - This paper provides insight to the background of the development and requirements for panel-zone design in the 1986 AISC LRFD specifications. In particular, two criteria for the design of beam-column panel zones are discussed; the first method is based on the von Mises first-yield criterion for the panel-zone web, and the other utilizes the postyield shear resistance of the panel derived from the flexural resistance of boundary elements surrounding the panel-zone joint. The nonlinear behavior of a moment-resisting frame with panel-zone joints designed according to these two requirements is studied. Lui's 1985 rigorous second-order elastic-plastic hinge analysis is used to assess the performance of a frame considering panel-zone deformations. An advanced analysis technique based on a notional-load plastic-hinge approach is introduced. This advanced analysis technique is used to evaluate the proper design criteria for panel-zone joints in moment-resisting frames, and to study the influence of panel-zone deformations on the frame's limit of resistance. From these studies, the effects of the panel-zone deformations on the overall frame resistance can then be summarized and discussed.
