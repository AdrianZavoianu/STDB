AB - Spiral grain, defined as the situation where wood fibers are inclined in the longitudinal-tangential plane of the tree stem, is known to negatively affect the performance and dimensional stability of structural timber in service. The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of spiral grain on the bending stiffness of wooden beams through both a theoretical model and an experimental test protocol. The theoretical model is based on a new formula derived from the theory related to the transformation of the second-order tensor of elastic compliances. The experimental protocol is dedicated to the creation of artificial spiral grain and the validation of the new formula. Theoretical results show that the new formula is a better predictor of the bending stiffness than the well-known Hankinson formula. A preliminary validation of the new formula is attempted through experiments on small Douglas-fir beams containing uniform spiral grain. The new formula is shown to be in very good agreement with experimental results.

AB - The characteristics of confined-concrete columns under strain gradient were examined. Twelve columns were tested under two different levels of end eccentricity. The test parameters included the arrangement, spacing, and volumetric ratio of confinement reinforcement. Columns with well-distributed longitudinal reinforcement, laterally supported by closely spaced transverse reinforcement, showed extremely ductile behavior, developing inelastic displacements exceeding 4% of the drift ratio without a significant loss of strength. Those with a low volumetric ratio and wide spacing of transverse steel developed strength decay immediately after the peak load. A confined concrete model, developed on the basis of column tests under concentric loading, was used to compute analytical moment-curvature relationships of the critical column section. The analytical relationships are compared with those recorded experimentally, for columns with different eccentricity of loading and parameters of confinement. The comparisons indicate that the flexural behavior of confined-concrete columns can be computed reasonably accurately by a confined-concrete model developed for concentric loading, provided that the relevant parameters of confinement are incorporated in the model, and that strain hardening in reinforcement is considered.

AB - If ground motion is not uniform over a building's base, or if the building is asymmetric, torsional response occurs. This paper investigates the effect of torsional coupling induced by both multiple ground excitations and building asymmetry on earthquake forces. The system studied is an idealized single-story two-degrees-of-freedom building model with four supports. Spatially varying ground excitations at the supports are used. Thirty sets of spatially correlated ground-motion time histories are simulated for the analysis. Each set of the simulated time histories are compatible with an empirical coherency loss function of recorded motions, and they are also individually compatible with the Newmark-Hall response spectrum with 5% damping and normalized to 0.5 g
. The mean and standard deviations of base shear and torque corresponding to the 30 sets of simulated time histories are calculated. Results are presented in terms of nondimensional parameters, accounting for both the eccentricity and multiple-ground-motion-phase differences. The torsional coupling effect induced by both nonuniform base excitations and building asymmetry on earthquake forces is discussed. Some preliminary discussions on the adequacy of the torsional provisions of current building codes are also made.

AB - In this paper, tests on the lateral buckling of cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS) beams under uniform bending moment are described. The section size chosen for testing is 75 × 25 × 2.5 mm, which is the largest depth/width ratio manufactured in Australia. The beam spans varied from 2,000 to 7,000 mm to produce a large range of beam-slenderness ratios. Carefully designed loading and support systems were used in the tests to apply gravity load through the centroid of the section and to ensure that simply supported end conditions were achieved. The test results are compared with existing design models and standards. An improved design rule is given for the lateral buckling of cold-formed RHS beams.

AB - During severe earthquakes, the inelastic action of the eccentrically braced frame (EBF) system is intended to be confined to the eccentric shear- and moment-link elements. To perform reliable inelastic static and dynamic analysis of EBFs, which rely on shear or moment yielding of the link element, accurate modeling of behavior of these elements is essential. Available computer codes lack such a specialized shear-link model in their element library. In this study, an analytical model that represents the behavior of shear links is proposed. The model parameters are established based on observations from several experiments involving shear links. Comparison of the model predictions with available test observations and analytical results established the accuracy and wide applicability of the model for the cases of cyclic and earthquake loadings. The proposed model can be effectively used to perform inelastic static and dynamic analyses of EBFs.

AB - The stability condition of masonry walls subjected to seismic transverse forces is investigated by translating the problem into the analysis of a fixed–free ended prismatic column undergoing static horizontal forces equivalent to the maximum inertia actions. The column is assumed to be made of a no-tension material, with a linear stress-strain law in compression. The solution is achieved by a numerical model in which the column is ideally divided into a sufficiently high number of elements, each with uniform curvature. With reference to the deformed shape corresponding to a given load condition, this approach allows the stress and strain characteristic quantities of a cross section to be expressed recursively, and the stability domain to be defined in dimensionless terms. In the general case of a column subjected to its own weight, to a concentrated eccentric compressive load acting at the top, and to the related horizontal inertia forces, the results show that large-displacement effects, due to the material flexibility, can considerably reduce the maximum slenderness value corresponding to the rigid-body equilibrium condition.

AB - Genetic-algorithm (GA)–based structural optimization can be parallelized to a high degree on new generation of scalable distributed-memory multiprocessors. In this paper, a mixed computational model is presented for GA-based structural optimization of large space structures on massively parallel supercomputers. Parallelism is exploited at both coarse-grained design optimization level in genetic search using the multiple-instruction–multiple-data model of computing and fine-grained fitness function evaluation level using the single-instruction–multiple-data model of computing. The latter model involves the development of a data-parallel iterative preconditioner-conjugate-gradient algorithm for the solution of the resulting system of linear equations. The model has been implemented on Connection Machine CM-5 and applied to optimization of large space steel structures subjected to the constraints of the American Institute of Steel Construction's allowable stress design specifications. The model and concurrent algorithm developed in this research is highly scalable. A peak performance of 2.4 giga–floating-point operations per second is achieved using 512 processors for a structure consisting of 4,016 elements.

AB - This paper presents an in-depth structural engineering and structural reliability analysis of concrete masonry beams. The ductile response of masonry beams was studied in detail. A limit-state design methodology for reinforced-concrete masonry beams is presented in this paper based on the principles of structural reliability. Recommended values of capacity-reduction factors were developed that explicitly account the design safety of the limit states. The reinforcing steel bars are uniformly distributed throughout the beam section. Three different ductility definitions (strain, curvature, and displacement) were derived and presented. This paper also formulated a structural reliability analysis method to establish limitations on the quantity of steel in masonry beams. Equations were derived for the expected capacity at yield and ultimate limit states. An important part of this paper was to quantify the uncertainty in the design capacity of concrete masonry beams of different limit states resulting from the variation of design variables. A Monte Carlo analysis was performed to incorporate the uncertainties in material properties, structural engineering equations, and construction quality control.

AB - The paper investigates the behavior of plate and stiffener assemblies under nonuniform compressive stress. The first part deals with the buckling behavior and the second part investigates postbuckling response. With stiffeners assumed to possess finite rotation capacity, a general expression is derived for the prediction of the elastic buckling of the assembly under this general loading condition. The accuracy of the derived expression, also obtained numerically using the Galerkin method, is compared with other available data for the two limiting conditions of rotationally free and clamped unloaded boundaries. Results show that the prediction is within a 5% difference. The influence of rotational restraint and stress gradient upon the buckling load and the associated buckling mode is also investigated. In the second part, the investigation is extended to the postbuckling range. The compatibility differential equation is first solved analytically and then an approximate solution of the equilibrium equation is obtained using the Galerkin method. Explicit expressions are derived for the load deflection, ultimate strength, and membrane stress distributions. Analytical effective-width formulations based on the characteristics of the stress field of the buckled plate are proposed for this general loading condition. The predicted load-deflection expression is compared with independent test results.

AB - The behavior of two through plate girder railway bridges were investigated to determine a better approach to fatigue assessment. One bridge, a 21.3-m span near Old Fort, North Carolina, was instrumented, and measurements of member strains and deflections were taken during the crossing of a work train. These measurements were used to calibrate a parametric study of the modeling of this bridge structure and the applied loading to the structure. The second bridge, a 12.2-m span in Vonore, Tennessee, was analyzed using the same modeling developed for the first bridge to determine the differences between the responses of these two span lengths when subjected to similar traffic patterns. From the results of this study two conclusions were drawn: (1) the response of plate girders is controlled more by axle spacings than by axle loads; and (2) the influence of track structure interaction and bridge floor system continuity during analysis is crucial to accurately assessing maximum stresses or number and magnitude of stress cycles. More importantly, the analysis technique presented in this paper provides a better and more favorable prediction of the actual stresses experienced by a bridge during the crossing of a train.

AB - The study reported in this paper has been motivated by the need for accurate estimation of tube capacity under combined loads due to axial force, bending, and external pressure. Unstiffened and ring-stiffened tubular members for offshore applications are analyzed using a rigorous finite-element technique, developed for the purposes of this research. The technique accounts for changes in the geometry of the tube, elastoplastic material behavior, longitudinal and cross-sectional imperfections, and residual stresses from the tube-manufacturing process. The computational results are compared with available experimental data as well as design equations, toward better understanding of tubular-member behavior. Of particular interest is the axial capacity reduction in the presence of pressure. For the unstiffened tubes considered, the ultimate thrust is nearly unaffected by pressure. However, stiffened tubes can be subjected to high levels of pressure that will, in turn, affect the maximum axial compression. The effects of pressure on the bending capacity are significant for both unstiffened and stiffened tubes.

AB - A finite-element program, WALSEIZ, capable of performing nonlinear analysis of a timber shear wall subjected to monotonic or dynamic loads is presented. Each wall is composed of four elements: a beam element to model the framing, a plate element to model the sheathing, nonlinear springs to model the sheathing-to-framing connectors (the load-displacement properties of which vary depending on whether monotonic or cyclic loads are applied), and a bilinear spring to model bearing between adjacent sheathing panels. The program can compute displacements at each of the nodes, forces, and stresses in each of the elements as a function of applied load for monotonic analysis and as a function of time for dynamic analysis. Results from the program are compared with experimental data to validate the program. The program is being used in investigations on the response of shear walls subjected to dynamic loads such as earthquakes and hurricanes.

AB - This paper is aimed at the development of a computationally efficient procedure for simulating the dynamic response of general vehicle-bridge systems. With the finite-element method, a vehicle is modeled as lumped masses supported by springs and dashpots, and a bridge with rough pavement by beam elements. An interaction element is defined to consist of a bridge element and the suspension units of the vehicle resting on the element. The composition of an interaction element and the parts of car bodies in contact is regarded as a substructure. By the dynamic condensation method, all the degrees of freedom associated with the car bodies existing within each substructure are eliminated. As the condensation has been performed on the element level, a conventional assembly process can be applied to form the structural equations. Compared with most existing procedures, the present technique appears to be computationally more efficient. It is particularly suitable for the simulation of bridges with a series of vehicles moving at different speeds and/or directions.

AB - In this paper, a new set of impact formulas are developed for simple and continuous beams subjected to moving vehicle loads. By modeling a vehicle as sprung masses and a bridge structure by beam elements, a parametric study is performed for various simple and continuous beams traversed by five-axle trucks. Central to this study is the adoption of a nondimensional speed parameter  s
, which is defined as the ratio of the driving frequency of the vehicle, as represented by πv/L, with  v
 denoting the velocity of the vehicle and  L
 the characteristic length of the beam, to the fundamental frequency ω of the beam. From the numerical study, it is concluded that the impact factors for the deflections, bending moments, and shear forces at the midpoints of simple beams are linearly proportional to the speed parameter, and that these formulas can be multiplied by certain modification factors to yield results for continuous beams and support shears. Other parameters studied herein include the vehicle/bridge frequency ratio, damping of the bridge, and road surface roughness.

AB - Currently, in many areas of North America, special permits are issued to extra heavy vehicles without a detailed evaluation of individual components, considering only the ultimate capacity of the bridge inventory as a whole. Based on this, a large number of special permits have been issued to extra heavy vehicles. In this perspective, the ultimate and cumulative effect of such overloads on steel bridge components is studied. It is found that steel bridge members have adequate ultimate capacity to accommodate such overloads; however, they may suffer fatigue damage due to the cumulative effect of these overloads. Accordingly, a fatigue-based methodology is developed to assess the reduction in service life of bridges due to heavy-permit trucks. It is found that a reasonably large number of special permits can be issued at small reductions in fatigue life, but because stress ranges in excess of the constant-amplitude fatigue limit significantly alter the shape of the  S
- N
 curve, it is essential to appreciate that the concept of infinite fatigue life cannot be relied upon anymore.

AB - The purpose of this research is to contribute to the definition of maximum carrying capacity and rational reinforcement schemes for structures such as deep beams, corbels, and dapped-end beams. The research included laboratory testing of 28 prismatic beam samples with a higher percentage of steel than currently permitted in design practice. The tests revealed that the nominal shear capacity may significantly exceed the current limits of both the American and Canadian codes if proper reinforcement is provided. The ratio of nominal shear stress to the compressive strength of concrete ( v u
/f′) can be as much as 0.42 when horizontal reinforcement is used, and 0.85 when a sufficient inclined reinforcement is provided. Strut and tie models, composed of multiple compression struts and tension ties corresponding to the configuration of the reinforcement, were used to analyze the test results. In all cases, the strut and tie models rendered results comparable with those from the laboratory tests. The ultimate shear capacity may be governed either by the compression struts (concrete) or the tension ties (steel). The maximum capacity occurs when the amount of reinforcement at least corresponds with the balanced condition, where the capacity of the tension ties is equal to, or greater than, that of the compression struts.

AB - In cantilever-suspended-span construction, secondary framing members such as open-web steel joists are likely to enhance markedly the stability of the beams that support them. Properly made joist-beam connections enable the joists to provide both lateral and torsional restraints to the beam top flange at discrete locations. This restraint, in turn, is transmitted through the web to the bottom flange of the beam, which is in compression in negative moment regions. Therefore, the buckling modes are generally characterized by the occurrence of web distortion. Current design procedures for this very common form of construction are inadequate as they do not consider web distortion and the beneficial effect of torsional restraint. They may also neglect the detrimental effect of the height of load application above the shear center. This results in an inaccurate assessment of the lateral-torsional buckling resistance. A finite-element model, corroborated by tests, is used to develop a simplified design procedure for these beams.

AB - Prediction of hurricane wind speeds using a simulation approach is the most universally accepted methodology for estimating design wind speeds in hurricane-prone regions of the world. An updated hurricane simulation methodology incorporating newly developed wind-field and filling models is used to obtain hurricane wind speeds associated with various return periods along the hurricane-prone coastline of the United States. Simulation results using the new hurricane simulation methodology indicate that design wind speeds given in ASCE-7-88 for the inland portion of the hurricane-prone coastline are excessive, and that the long-return-period wind speeds given in 1980 by Batts et al. are low. The simulation approach is extended to illustrate areawide hurricane area risk versus single-point risk by comparing hurricane risk for Dade County, Fla., to a single-point risk of a building in Miami, Fla.

AB - Two key modeling components in the hurricane simulation process are the wind-field model, and the filling model, which describes the rate of decay of the hurricane after landfall is made. In the investigation described here, new wind-field and filling-rate models are developed for use in hurricane simulation routines. Detailed evaluations of the wind-field and filling models used in 1980 by Batts et al., which are used to develop the hurricane wind speeds given in ASCE-7-88, and the new wind-field and filling models are performed. Results indicate that the combination of wind-field and filling models employed in the original study used to derive hurricane wind speeds given in ASCE-7-88 yield significant overestimates of hurricane wind speeds at inland locations, and their wind-field model is unable to reproduce the high surface-level wind speeds evident in very intense storms. The deficiencies in the models used by Batts et al. are carried through to the recommended design wind speeds given in ASCE-7-88.

AB - Results of laboratory tests on four repaired reinforced-concrete flat-slab interior column connections, carrying quasi-static, reversed, horizontal loadings are presented. The specimens, which originally had totally failed, were repaired and subjected to gradually increasing reversed loading histories, similar to those imposed on the original specimens. A comparative analysis was made before the repair. The specimens were repaired by using externally screwed steel plates replacing the lost or damaged full reinforcement of the slab. In addition, high-pressure epoxy injection provided the bond between the concrete and the new reinforcement. Moreover, this repair method can be easily used to restore, strengthen, or upgrade existing and old flat-slab buildings, not suitably designed to withstand earthquakes. The practical aspects of the repair technique developed for postearthquake mass production were emphasized, with satisfactory results even when not applied by research laboratory experts.

AB - Programs for the safety control of nuclear power plants include those that check the prestressing forces in the containment by pullout testing. The selection of the range of tolerance for stresses may be approached as a decision problem in a context of uncertainty. A priori analysis of this decision is made by assuming several simplifications of both the possible actions and the random states that may arise. This analysis shows that the pullout tests, carried out to check the state of prestressing of the containment structure of nuclear power plants, may show to be excessively costly if the ranges of tolerance are strict; if they are wide, these tests are unlikely to fulfill their purpose. This analysis also reveals that the position of nuclear authorities with regard to technically unjustified shutdowns of plants can influence significantly the optimal range of tolerance for stresses in pullout tests of tendons.

AB - An alternative abbreviated method for column design and analysis is presented. The method determines, in one relatively brief computational series, the maximum allowable unbraced length (design) or the allowable column loading (analysis) for a given column and set of conditions. In addition, the trial and error design steps are reduced significantly. The method was derived by first setting the actual compressive stress  f c
 equal to the allowable compressive stress  F
′. The solution then proceeds in the reverse order of the existing computational method as presented in the  Timber Construction Manual
 (1994). If the computed allowable length is found to be greater than or equal to the column length, the unbraced column is adequate. The computational steps of the method are first developed and then combined into a single equation. This reduces the column design and analysis steps substantially. Application of the method is demonstrated.
