AB - Twenty-eight stiffened Z-section beams were transversely loaded to failure and stresses in the lap joints were investigated. Spans of 2.438 m (8 ft) were used. The tested sections were of web depth-to-thickness ratios ( h/t
) ranging from 79 to 131, and were selected from those commonly used by the metal building industry. The tests included a single-section beam of each Z-section and lapped beams with a lap-to-span ratio ranging from 0.25 to 1.0. The results indicated that the lapping process significantly enhanced the load capacity and stiffness of the beams for lap-to-span ratios up to 0.5. For higher ratios, little or no enhancement was noted. Failure was encountered in the single-section zone for beams with lap-to-span ratios less than 0.5 and in the lap zone for higher ratios. The analyses of the stresses in the lap joints indicated that the failure mechanism was governed by bending. Correlations were developed to predict the relative stiffness of the lap zone. The predicted ultimate moments using these correlations were in close agreement with the test results, and the 1986 American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) design specifications were found to be adequate for predicting the strength of single Z-sections.

AB - This paper presents an experimental investigation on the hysteretic behavior of shear panels made of low-yield steel whose nominal 0.2% offset yield stress is 120 MPa. Six shear panels were tested, with the loading conditions and width-to-thickness ratio as test variables. Major findings drawn from this study are as follows. Strain-hardening is very conspicuous under cycles with the same deformation amplitude as well as with increasing deformations. Energy dissipated by the tested shear panels is 1.5–2.0 times larger than the energy that can be dissipated by the equivalent linearly elastic and perfectly plastic system. The hysteretic behavior that involves drastic strain hardening can be simulated accurately by the multisurface model if the associated parameters are chosen properly. A companion paper presents relatively simple models that can simulate the hysteretic behavior of the tested shear panels.

AB - This paper proposes simple models that can simulate the hysteretic behavior of shear panels made of low-yield steel, which exhibits significant strain-hardening under load reversals. The models are based on either the bilinear or the Ramberg-Osgood model, and combine kinematic and isotropic hardening in a linear manner by the introduction of a weighting coefficient. The accuracy of these models is demonstrated by comparing hysteresis curves obtained from these models with experimental hysteresis curves, which have been supplied by a quasi-static loading test with a prescribed deformation history and by a pseudodynamic test. Programming of these models is found to be very easy, involving only slight modification of the programs developed for the bilinear and the Ramberg-Osgood models. Thus, these models can readily be incorporated into inelastic dynamic response analysis of structures having shear panels made of low-yield steel as hysteretic dampers.

AB - This paper is primarily concerned with the formation of barrel-vault space trusses derived from a flat configuration by posttensioning. To obtain a fairly general picture of the shape-formation process by means of posttensioning, both gently and sharply curved barrel-vault models are studied. The structures are devised to be near mechanisms during the posttensioning operation. They are considered to be near mechanisms because only the flexural stiffness of the top chords provides any appreciable resistance to deformation apart from friction and self weight. Therefore, no appreciable axial force is induced in the members of the structures during the shape-formation process. The result of experimental and theoretical work on the shape formation of barrel-vault space trusses by means of posttensioning is presented here. The shape-formation process, referred to as self-erection, can lead to significant economies in the construction of large-span lightweight structures by eliminating or minimizing the need for scaffolding and heavy cranes.

AB - This paper describes an approach, based on the concepts of continuum damage mechanics and standard inelastic analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) frames, to the modeling of the hysteretic behavior of RC frames. A frame member is considered as the assemblage of an elastic beam-column and two inelastic hinges, as in the conventional lumped plasticity models. Three sets of internal variables, which measure plastic rotations and the state of damage of the member, are introduced. An expression for the flexibility matrices and the complementary strain energy of a member are proposed as a function of these internal variables. The resulting model can be classified as “unilateral,” i.e., it is assumed that damage due to positive actions has no influence in the behavior under negative action due to the closure of cracks when moments change sign. The accuracy of the model is verified by simulating various experiments for which data were available in the literature. The model is very simple in nature and as a result is not comprehensive; however, the approach presented is amenable of further generalizations.

AB - A new postcracking formulation for concrete, along with both implicit and explicit layering procedures, is used in the analysis of reinforced-concrete (RC) flexural and torsional elements. The postcracking formulation accounts for tension stiffening in concrete along the rebar directions, compression softening in cracked concrete based on either stresses or strains, and aggregate interlock based on crack-confining normal stresses. Transverse shear stresses computed using the layering procedures are included in material model considerations that permit the development of inclined cracks through the RC cross section. Examples of a beam analyzed by both the layering techniques, a torsional element, and a column-slab connection region analyzed by the implicit layering procedure are presented here. The study highlights the primary advantages and disadvantages of each layering approach, identifying the class of problems where the application of either procedure is more suitable.

AB - Cable-stayed bridges under wind loading exhibit dynamic behaviors that depend on the aeroelastic forces and coupling among vibration modes. In particular, the new long-span cable-stayed designs can lead to behaviors highly dependent on the coupling between distinct modal forms of vibration. To broaden the applications of existing analytical models and to examine their possible shortcomings when facing new design concepts, this paper presents a finite-element modal formulation to deal with cable-stayed bridges under laminar wind flow. In this numerical model aeroelastic forces are described as functions of the experimentally obtained flutter derivatives, and coupling among various vibration modes can be easily considered. The derived equations of motions are solved for a numerical example and the results are compared with those obtained from an analytical method in which instability is rationally considered to occur in one particular mode.

AB - The column design criterion adopted in the 1991 National Design Specification (NDS) contains a parameter  c
 that depends on homogeneity and straightness. The objective of this study was to determine whether the improved homogeneity and initial straightness of laminated members are sufficient to justify a more liberal  c
-value for glued laminated (glulam) compared with that of solid sawn lumber. For Douglas-fir and southern pine glulam columns of four laminations, laminating did not exert a significant effect on  c. 
For Douglas fir, the most likely value of  c
 was found to be 0.76 (probable range, 0.63–0.89). For southern pine, the most likely value of  c
 was 0.83 (probable range, 0.78–0.87). These values do not differ significantly from the value of  c
= 0.8 adopted for dimension lumber. Therefore, we conclude that laminating does not exert a significant effect on  c
 in glulam of four laminations. However, the NDS column design criterion is still conservative in the design value for compressive strength parallel to grain.

AB - The collective experimental evidence from standard uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial tests of plain concrete is examined to identify the essential governing state variables for the benefit of three-dimensional constitutive modeling of the material. It is shown that the volumetric expansion that develops in mechanically loaded concrete due to progressive microcracking is an important measure of the extent of damage in the material microstructure, and can be used to consistently estimate the changes effected on the resistance of concrete as damage accumulates. Within this framework, the degree of restraint against expansion, such as is provided by arbitrary boundary conditions, can be used to completely determine the residual strength and deformability of concrete under these conditions. These concepts provide the tools for the development of a simple but general constitutive model for concrete and offer an opportunity for unification of the existing interpretations of various aspects of the observed mechanical response of concrete. Example problems are included demonstrating that with a limited number of physical variables it is possible to reproduce the sensitivities of an array of benchmark experiments.

AB - The strength of steel tubes used in offshore construction is often limited by local and global stability considerations. We propose a new composite tube, which consists of two concentric steel tubes with polymer concrete sandwiched in between them. The increase in section modulus will enhance the global stability in long tube applications. The interaction of the three components of the composite tube will have a positive impact on the local stability of the tube. This study concentrates on the local stability issue and quantifies the strength and ductility enhancement due to the interaction. Twenty-six small-scale models of short composite tubes were tested under uniaxial compression and six were tested under cyclic semireversal axial loading. Test results showed that the new composite tubes generally had a compressive strength 10–30% higher than the sum of the individual components. The ductility of the composite tube was also much improved. The prediction of strength by an analytical model and an empirical formula is reported in a companion paper.

In this paper, an analytical model is presented to predict the response of the sandwich tube under an axial load up to its peak strength. The tracing of the load-deformation curve was accomplished through an iterative procedure. An empirical formula for the peak strength of the sandwich tube is also presented. Both the analytical model and the empirical formula predict the peak strength of the sandwich tube well.

AB - A model developed for the study of the individual contributions to shear capacity in reinforced concrete (RC) and prestressed concrete (PC) thin-webbed beams is improved here by introducing dowel action, nonuniform distribution of crack opening and slip, and plastic-strain accumulation in the stirrups. The proposed approach is based on the truss analogy and on the diagonal-compression concept, within the context of limit analysis: the failure in shear is related to the simultaneous yielding of the stirrups and the collapse of the compressive struts in shear compression. The model, which is not devised to be an alternative to other code-oriented and simpler models, has a threefold purpose: (1) To provide a viable and open-structure tool to assess the roles of various shear-resistant mechanisms; (2) to guarantee a ductile collapse in shear through a suitable design for the stirrups; and (3) to provide a key to the truss role in shear-sensitive reinforced beams. The proposed model is checked against many test data (RC and PC beams) and its predictions turn out to be markedly closer to test results than either EC2 or ACI codes.

AB - In this paper, the efficiency of tendon profiles is examined for the internal and external prestressing of statically indeterminate structures. The statically indeterminate component of the total prestressing moment is shown to be significant for both parabolic and linear tendon profiles. However, although linear profiles are more effective in counteracting gravity moments in support regions, their efficiency within the spans can be significantly reduced. Therefore, for these profiles, it is more difficult to optimize the effective eccentricity of the prestressing force all along the members. On the other hand, internal prestressing with parabolic tendons offers a more uniform efficiency throughout the structure. Recommendations indicate how localized linear tendons can improve the efficiency of external prestressing.

AB - The concept of prestressing has been used as an effective technique to strengthen composite steel-concrete girders in bridges and buildings. Although several researchers have investigated the behavior of this structural system under static loading, no one has addressed the fatigue behavior. This paper analyzes and summarizes the fatigue test data for the main constituent components of prestressed composite steel-concrete girders—strands, shear studs, and cover plates. The data are also compared with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) requirements. It appears that end-anchored strands for nonbonded, prestressed structures can be designed for fatigue to the AASHTO allowable stress range for category C. AASHTO's approach to designing shear studs and cover plates seems reasonable for prestressed composite girders. A companion paper presents the fatigue behavior of these elements within a prestressed composite girder.

Investigators have determined the static strength of prestressed composite girders, but without addressing fatigue strength—an important design factor in highway bridges. In this paper, 11 prestressed composite beams with a cover plate welded to the tension flange were prestressed with two seven-wire strands. In fatigue tests to failure, cracks initiated in the flange at the cover-plate ends. Stress ranges in the strands and at the base of the shear studs were too small to initiate cracks. Prestressing of the steel beam so that the stress in the tension flange alternates between tension and compression under cyclic loading raised the fatigue strength of the welded cover plates by one category, from D to C.

AB - Existing lamination and beam test results were analytically reviewed to quantify the laminating effect for European and North American glued-laminated (glulam) timber. The laminating effect is defined as the increase in strength of lumber laminations when bonded in a glulam beam compared with their strength when tested by standard test procedures. Fundamental concepts are presented to define the laminating effect, estimates are made of its magnitude, and relationships are presented to describe its character. Our review of experimental data indicated that the laminating effect ranged from 1.06 to 1.59 for European glulam and from 0.95 to 2.51 for North American glulam.

AB - This paper focuses on a study of the variations in geometrical quantities of reinforced-concrete members on three large project sites in Nigeria. Poor inspection enforcement during construction, among other factors, was identified as being responsible for the geometrical imperfections of the studied members. It is believed that this investigation will not only add to the existing body of literature on the subject, but will also be useful to practicing engineers and research groups and committees involved in the development of global structural codes.
