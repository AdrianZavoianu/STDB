AB - Full-scale forced-vibration tests conducted before and after structural repairs on a multispan reinforced-concrete highway bridge are described in the paper. The tests were conducted to investigate any correlation that may exist between the repair works and changes in the dynamic characteristics of the bridge. The approach adopted is suitable for assessing the structural condition of a bridge using vibration data. A purpose-built hydraulic vibrator was used to artificially excite the bridge, and the dynamic response was measured by accelerometers placed on the bridge deck. A single-degree-of-freedom model was fitted to the response functions in order to extract natural frequencies, modal damping ratios, and mode shapes. It was found that the repair works caused a slight reduction in the natural frequencies but there was no definite trend in the changes to the modal damping ratios. Comparison of the mode shapes before and after repairs using modal analysis procedures was found to give an indication of the location of the repairs.

AB - In this study, the writers aim to provide a basic understanding of the creep behavior of wood members reinforced with fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials epoxy-bonded to the tension faces. An analytical method is presented first for the deformation of cross sections based on a Burger model combined with a mechanosorptive element for wood, Findley's model for composite materials, and a stress-relaxation procedure to yield the cross-section stresses and strains as a function of time, for both constant and variable temperature and humidity conditions. Parametric studies assessing the effect of the type and area fraction of composite material on the creep response of FRP-reinforced wood members are also presented, for both constant and variable environment. Finally, the analytical model is employed to predict the time-dependent deflections of wood beams reinforced with carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates of different thicknesses, and the results of a short experimental program involving FRP-reinforced wood beams under constant environment conditions are also described. The (limited) results are in good agreement with the analytical model.

AB - The paper describes a test program performed at the University of Sydney on small-scale (15.25 m span and 4.62 m high) complete single stressed-arch frames subjected to simulated gravity (vertical) loading. The analytical techniques employed in, and the results of, finite-element nonlinear analyses of the frame behavior are also reported. The distinguishing feature of stressed-arch frames compared to conventional steel truss frames is that the arches are erected using a posttensioning process, rather than through the traditional techniques involving the use of cranes and scaffolding. As a result of the posttensioning erection process, the top chord becomes curved and often strained into the plastic range. The purpose of the tests on small-scale frames and the subsequent theoretical analyses was to determine the behavior and strength of the highly curved and yielded top chord in complete frames, as opposed to the isolated subassemblages of stressed-arch frames investigated in previous studies.

AB - Stressed-arch frames are characterized by a posttensioning procedure that is used to erect the frames from an assembled configuration at ground level to a final erected shape. During the erection process, the top chord becomes curved and is usually stressed into the inelastic range. Consequently, the strength of the erected frame under service loading cannot be assessed rationally using conventional elastic or plastic methods for the analysis and design of steel structures. The purpose of this paper is to examine in detail the provisions of the Australian Standard for Steel Structures, AS4100-1990, and the 1993 American Institute of Steel Construction Load and Resistance Factor Design Specification (AISC LRFD) for the design of the top chord of stressed-arch frames, and to propose and validate a simple design procedure. In particular, the irrationality of design based on conventional elastic and plastic methods, and, alternatively, the rationality of design based on advanced analysis as described in AS4100-1990, is identified.

AB - Recent experimental research clearly shows that the strength of stud shear connectors in composite bridge beams immediately reduces when fatigue loads are applied to them. A new fatigue procedure has been developed that allows for this reduction in strength. This procedure can be used in a design mode, for which the strength of connectors required to resist the maximum design load, i.e., overload, is increased to allow for the reduction in strength due to the fatigue loads. Furthermore, the procedure can be used in an assessment mode, for which the reduction in strength due to fatigue loads on the connectors in existing structures can be determined. Theoretical and experimental research has now reached a stage in which this new fatigue procedure can be applied in full. The present paper gives the material properties required for the application of this procedure, as well as examples covering the design of stud shear connectors in a new structure and the assessment of the strength and endurance of stud shear connectors in an existing structure.

AB - Timber beams with holes have been analyzed with linear elastic fracture mechanics. The energy release rate corresponding to the beginning of the crack growth is set equal to the external work done by the loading of the beam. Further, this fracture energy is partitioned into a mode I and a mode II component. Stress intensities at the hole corner are calculated from the strain energy release rates, and the orthotropicity of the material is taken into account. If the hole is near to the support or the point load, a correction term is given for the basic solution. The equations are derived for a rectangular hole, but a circular hole can be modeled with a rectangular one. Solutions for special cases as beam with cracks are given. The method can be extended to other load and support conditions, crack sources, and other orthotropic materials. The analytical solution was experimentally evaluated. Wu's fracture criterion was found to be applicable for beams with known material properties. For small clear beams, the measured capacity was 0.97 times the predicted one. For glulam beams, the measured capacity was 1.04 times the predicted one.

AB - Thirteen experiments are performed to investigate the cyclic behavior of beam-to-column joints of steel frames with slender joint panels. The performance of the joints with respect to strength, rigidity, ductility, and low cycle fatigue are examined. Three different load-carrying mechanisms can be identified. They are the shear action of the web panel, the tension field action, and the frame action of the surrounding elements. The various characteristics of these actions as determined by the experiments are discussed. It is concluded that a good performance can be achieved by properly selecting the dimensions of the web panel, the surrounding flanges, and their relative proportions.

AB - This paper is concerned with the ultimate load behavior of I-beams curved in plan. Results obtained from experiments on two sets of I-beams (one comprising rolled sections and the other built-up sections) are presented. The test results for deformations and ultimate strength are found to be in good agreement with the corresponding values predicted by using the elastoplastic finite-element analysis. The effects of residual stresses and radius of curvature to span-length ratio ( R
/L) on ultimate strength are considered. Each beam was subjected to a concentrated load applied at an intermediate point where the beam was laterally restrained. Test results indicate that the load-carrying capacity decreases with the decrease in the  R
/L ratio.

AB - This paper presents some of the results of a study involving the ultimate and postpeak capacity of composite concrete-steel plate walls subjected to transverse and longitudinal loading. The main application of these composite walls lies in the design of offshore structures subjected to large forces from wave action or moving ice. In this study, a nonlinear finite-element approach is used to determine both ultimate strength and post-peak capacity of a selected composite wall system. The frictional and contact interface between steel and concrete is modeled. Numerical results are compared with those obtained from experiments for a variety of wall geometry and loading configurations. Insight into the behavior of the walls is readily obtained in terms of the modes of failure, load carrying mechanism, stress redistribution, and postpeak response.

AB - The effects of heavy vehicles with leaf-spring and air-spring suspensions on the dynamic response of short-span highway bridges are considered in this paper. The dynamic bridge responses are calculated by modeling the bridge and vehicle separately and combining the models with an iterative procedure. The bridge model is obtained by combining mode shapes with dynamic wheel loads in a convolution integral. This bridge calculation procedure is validated by experiments on two highway bridges. The validated, nonlinear vehicle models consist of a leaf-sprung, four-axle articulated vehicle, and a similar vehicle fitted with air suspensions and hydraulic dampers. These two vehicle models are combined with three different bridge models to predict dynamic bridge responses. Two surface profiles are used on each bridge: a step up at the entrance, and a pseudo-random profile. Dynamic response increments are used to compare the effects of the two vehicles on bridges. The air-suspended vehicle is found to cause significantly lower dynamic bridge responses than the leaf-spring suspended vehicle.

AB - Shear walls are subjected to biaxial in-plane stresses when resisting seismic or wind loadings. Vertical tensile cracking reduces the compressive strength of walls in a direction normal to the tensile strain. This has been widely studied and accepted for reinforced concrete. However, for reinforced masonry there are no data available to predict the reduced compressive strength and behavior for walls with lateral tensile strains. To provide data for masonry, a biaxial test frame was constructed capable of loading masonry panels 80 cm (32 in.) high by 120 cm (48 in.) wide in combined compression and tension. Reinforced masonry panels subjected to various levels of lateral tensile strain were loaded to vertical compressive failure. Results from a test series of wall panels tested under various levels of lateral tension and vertical compression were used to establish a model to predict the reduction in compressive strength due to the lateral strain field.

AB - Light-frame wood roof assemblies may be stronger than what the current single member design approach suggests because of repetitive member load sharing and partial composite action. These strengthening effects are partially addressed in the  National Design Specification for Wood Construction
 through a repetitive use factor of 1.15, applied to the allowable bending stress for repetitive wood members. This paper examines the effect of load sharing and composite action on wood pitched-roof assemblies through a new analysis model. Individual truss and roof assembly strength distributions were computed using the new model. The results show that slope, span, and other truss characteristics cause significant changes in the system factor for a given roof structure configuration. Computed system factors are presented in terms suitable for working stress and reliability-based design methodologies. Computed working stress design system factors vary from 1.15 to over 1.50 for the roof structures studied, suggesting that the current 1.15 factor may be conservative for many roof structures. This conservatism must be retained until more sophisticated analysis models, such as the one proposed herein, are fully verified and accepted for design.

AB - Available methods for discrete variable structural optimization are reviewed in this paper. Methods are classified according to three categories: branch and bound, approximations using branch and bound, and ad-hoc methods. The branch and bound method is theoretically correct for convex design tasks but is costly to use. Approximation methods provide efficiency but do not guarantee an optimum discrete solution. In a majority of the discrete optimization problems, approximation methods provide useful solutions and have been found to be the most practical. Ad-hoc methods such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms attempt to solve the discrete variable problem without resorting to branch and bound methods, and do not guarantee an optimum solution. However, ad-hoc methods provide reasonable solution at an acceptable computational cost. A stepped cantilever beam example is solved using branch and bound and approximation methods, to give a computational sense of the efforts involved in solving discrete variable optimization problems.

AB - Precast prestressed concrete panels have been used as subdecks in bridge construction. To experimentally investigate the nominal flexural and shear strengths of this composite slab system, five full-scale model composite slab specimens were constructed and tested. One specimen modeled bridge deck condition well within a girder span, and the other four specimens represented geometric conditions that occur with skewed concrete diaphragms at 0°, 15°, 30°, and 40°. The slabs were statically loaded through a wheel footprint at preselected locations until failure occurred. To analytically evaluate the nominal strength for these composite slab specimens, yield-line and punching-shear theories were applied to the crack patterns generated during the ultimate load tests. These computations and the observed mode of failure for the specimens indicated that punching shear governed the nominal strength of the slabs. The nominal strength of the slabs significantly exceeded the design load requirements.

AB - An analytical model of the behavior of continuous composite beams under sustained service loads is described. Each beam consists of a rolled or fabricated steel I-section acting compositely with a reinforced concrete slab attached to the top flange. The analysis accounts for cracking of the concrete slab in the negative moment regions at each interior support, as well as the time-dependent deformation caused by creep and shrinkage in the concrete slab. Measurements from a series of full-scale continuous composite beams, which were tested by the writers in a separate study for a period of 340 days under sustained uniformly distributed loads, are used to validate the theoretical model. Close agreement is observed between analytical and experimental results. Finally, the analytical model is used to investigate the effects of material nonlinearity on structural behavior.

AB - Finite-element analyses have shown that the membrane theory assumption for the behavior of gabled hyperbolic paraboloids is incorrect. The form of the structure was originally conceived using this erroneous assumption of membrane behavior, which assumes equal compressive and tensile arches, requiring an edge member that carries large axial forces. Finite-element models have shown that the tensile arches do not exist and that the edge member carries much smaller forces than those predicted by the membrane theory. This paper proposes a design based on these observations in which the edge beam is removed from the hypar. Material is added near the support to reduce the high stresses that result due to the removal of the beam material at this corner. The resulting form has no edge beams, and it has a thickened corner region.

AB - Reinforced concrete shells are structurally complex and closed-form models for their various limit states of serviceability and strength either are not available or may be based on approximations and idealizations of behavior. Nonlinear finite-element techniques have made it possible to account for the complexities of reinforced concrete behavior in the inelastic range, to identify these limit states more accurately, and to assess the safety and reliability of concrete shells. Traditional reliability analysis methods are more convenient to apply when closed-form mechanical models of limit states are available. In the absence of such models, the reliability analysis can be performed by response surface methods that approximate the limit states by polynomial surfaces obtained through finite-element analyses of the system at a set of predetermined experimental points. This paper presents the reliability analysis of a reinforced concrete containment structure by the response surface method. Axisymmetric nonlinear finite-element analyses were performed to define the limit surfaces and importance sampling was used for the calculation of limit state probabilities.

AB - The dynamic characteristics and effectiveness of multiple mass dampers (MMDs), a collection of several mass dampers with distributed natural frequencies, under random loading are investigated in this paper. The MMD attached in a parallel configuration modifies the transfer function of the damper-building system by flattening the peaks observed in a typical single tuned mass damper-building transfer function. The MMD parameters considered here include the frequency range of MMDs, damping ratio of individual dampers, and the number of dampers. Uniform and variable frequency increments in a specified frequency range and mass variation alone, and in combination, are considered. The secondary inertial effect can be represented by conventional mass dampers or liquid sloshing or oscillating liquid column dampers. A parameter study is conducted to delineate the influence of several parameters on the effectiveness and robustness of MMDs in comparison with a single tuned mass damper (TMD). The random loads considered here include wind and seismic excitations. It is demonstrated that the MMD configuration is more effective in controlling the motion of the primary system. It offers the advantages of portability and ease of installation (because of the reduced size of an individual damper), which makes it attractive not only for new installation, but also for temporary use during construction or for retrofitting existing structures.

AB - Dynamic bridge testing techniques used at the University of Sherbrooke on a series of highway bridges in the province of Quebec, Canada, are presented. These procedures were developed to obtain a reliable evaluation of the dynamic amplification factor for existing bridges, as part of an ongoing rehabilitation program of the province's road network. Vertical acceleration responses are obtained under normal or controlled traffic using different test vehicles and loading patterns. The vibration frequencies and mode shapes are calculated from a frequency analysis of the measured data, and used to calibrate finite-element models for each structure. The experimental methods and data-processing techniques are described. The need to establish standard testing procedures is discussed and some recommendations are presented. Examples of test results and comparisons with finite-element eigenvalue analyses are given for three different bridges.

AB - A simplified procedure is presented for redistributing moments caused by inelastic hinge rotations that accompany shakedown of continuous bridge girders under repeated live loadings. This inelastic moment redistribution procedure (IMR) is very similar to that of elastic moment distribution except that inelastic hinges, not girder joints, are initially held locked and then cyclically unlocked until convergence to shakedown occurs. Residual deformations due to shakedown are computed.
