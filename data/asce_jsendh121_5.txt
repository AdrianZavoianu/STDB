AB - Experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out to predict the fire resistance of rectangular hollow steel columns filled with bar-reinforced concrete. A mathematical model to calculate the temperatures, deformations, and fire resistance of the columns is presented in this paper. Calculated results are compared with those measured. The results indicate that the model is capable of predicting the fire resistance of square hollow steel columns, filled with bar-reinforced concrete, with an accuracy that is adequate for practical purposes. The model enables the expansion of data on the fire resistance of square concrete-filled steel columns, which at present consists predominantly of data for columns filled with plain concrete with data for columns filled with bar-reinforced concrete. Using the model, the fire resistance of square concrete-filled steel columns can be evaluated for any value of the significant parameters such as load, column-section dimensions, column length, and the percentage of reinforcing steel, without the necessity of testing.

AB - The investigation reported in the paper is an attempt to assess the relevance of soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects on the dynamic response of bridge piers responding in the inelastic range and, in particular, on the maximum required ductilities in the critical regions of the superstructure. The problem is dealt with reference to a simple structural configuration: a vertical cantilever carrying a mass at the top, representing realistic cases of bridge piers of common geometry with spread footing foundations. A relatively large number of parameters has been considered in the analysis, with a total of 240 cases examined, and with ductility demands on the piers ranging between 1.5 and 7. The results indicate that although in most cases SSI produces an increase of the maximum displacements, this effect is not very significant, and the inelastic demand in terms of curvature essentially remains unaffected by soil-structure interaction, showing a tendency to decrease. Finally, the stability of these conclusions against rather extreme variations of the parameters is confirmed by the results of additional bounding analyses, characterized by unusually soft soil conditions and by a seismic excitation multiplied by a factor of two.

AB - The use of finite-element packages by practioners as a design tool for reinforced concrete structures has increased considerably in the last few decades. All structural codes of practice recognize the assumption of linear elastic behavior at a design stage. However, the problem remains of calculating the required reinforcement in plates and shells. The amount of reinforcement is determined locally, i.e., for each sampling point, from the equilibrium  between applied and internal forces. The formulation of the method includes biaxial behavior of concrete and different lever arms for all the internal forces. Ideal plastic behavior is assumed for both materials. A reference is made to the absence of universally accepted solutions for the design of these structures and, therefore, scarcity of provisions in the structural concrete codes. To appraise the validity of the method, a comparison is made with experimental tests on slab and shell elements. Additional numerical results for practical structures are also given.

AB - This paper deals with experimental investigations to study the ultimate load behavior of I-beam to box-column connections stiffened externally. Specimens representative of interior columns in a steel building frame were fabricated with connections stiffened by T-sections butt-welded at the junction of the beam and column flange. They were tested to failure under static and fluctuating loads applied separately. Ultimate load-carrying capacity and typical load-deflection and moment-rotation responses obtained experimentally are presented; the results for those specimens tested under static loading are compared with the corresponding results using the elasto-plastic finite-element method. Close agreement is observed between the experimental and theoretical moment-rotation curves. Results show clearly that these connections satisfy the basic criteria: sufficient strength, sufficient rotation capacity, and adequate stiffness for a moment connection. The proposed connections are capable of developing load-carrying capacity in excess of the plastic capacity of the beams framing into the joint.

AB - The branch-and-bound method was originally developed to cope with difficulties caused by discontinuous design variables in linear programming. When the branch-and-bound method is applied to solve nonlinear programming (NLP) problems with a large number of mixed discontinuous and continuous design variables, the slow rate of convergence becomes a major drawback of the method. In this study, a number of enhancements are proposed to speed up the rate of convergence of the conventional branch-and-bound algorithm. Three NLP in the form of truss-design examples are tested to compare the capabilities and efficiency of the proposed enhancements. It is shown that of the five criteria for arranging the order in which the design variables are branched, the criterion of maximum cost difference dramatically reduces the number of branch nodes, thereby reducing the total number of continuous-optimization runs executed. Moreover, neighboring search, a branching procedure restricted in the neighborhood of the continuous optimum, is proven to be effective in speeding up the convergence. Investigation also shows that branching several design variables simultaneously is not as efficient as sequentially branching one variable at a time. The proposed enhancements are incorporated along with a sequential quadratic programming algorithm into a software package that is shown to be very useful in the optimal design of engineering structures.

AB - Due to the complex nature of a modern tall building consisting of thousands of structural members, the traditional trial-and-error design method is generally highly iterative and very time-consuming. This paper presents an automatic resizing technique for the optimal design of tall steel building frameworks. Specifically, a computer-based method is developed for the minimum weight design of lateral load-resisting steel frameworks subject to multiple interstory drift and member strength and sizing constraints in accordance with building code and fabrication requirements. The most economical standard steel sections to use for the structural members are automatically selected from commercially available standard section databases. The design-optimization problem is first formulated and expressed in an explicit form and is then solved by a rigorously derived optimality criteria (OC) algorithm. A full-scale 50-story three-dimensional (3D) asymmetrical building framework example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and practicality of the automatic resizing technique.

In this paper, the effect of injecting cement-based grouts in such walls is experimentally investigated on wallets subjected either to vertical or to diagonal compression. A drastic improvement of mechanical characteristics is observed thanks to the homogenization of the three-leaf masonry after the injection of the grout.

AB - The traditional use of displacement ductility factor for damage assessment of structures under high-intensity earthquake ground motion is inadequate, since it is implicitly assumed that damage occurs only due to maximum deformation and is independent of the number of nonpeak inelastic cycles or the plastic strain energy dissipated by the structure. A more recent approach, however, considers structural damage as a linear combination of the normalized maximum displacement and normalized plastic strain energy. At the ultimate limit state, the plastic strain energy is assumed to decrease linearly with the increase in displacement amplitude. The ultimate limit state is also assumed to be reached by the structure independent of the load path. In the present paper, experimental verification of the energy-based linear damage model is provided by small-scale tests of steel cantilever beams subjected to large inelastic displacement cycles. Test results support the linear assumption between plastic strain energy and imposed displacement, and the assumption of path independence of response to the ultimate limit state.

AB - The stability of a concrete gravity dam against sliding along the interface between the dam base and the foundation rock must be assured in a seismic safety evaluation. The hybrid frequency‚Äìtime domain procedure is used to compute the earthquake response of gravity dams, including base sliding. The procedure accounts for the nonlinear base sliding of the dam and the frequency-dependent response of the impounded water and the flexible foundation rock. A parameter study of typical gravity dams shows how the earthquake-induced sliding is affected by the characteristics of the ground motion and dam system. Based on the results of the study, it is necessary to include the effects of dam‚Äìfoundation rock interaction to obtain realistic estimates of the base sliding displacement for a dam. The sliding displacement is sensitive to the value of the coefficient of friction for the interface zone, especially for moderate to tall dams. Water compressibility also affects the base sliding displacement. Although a dam remains stable after an earthquake, the base sliding deformation may damage the interface zone without a significant isolation effect for the dam body.

AB - A series of experiments on profiled composite beams is reported. The experiments include two profiled composite beams and two reinforced concrete beams that were previously tested under sustained service loads. The tests reported were used to ascertain the flexural strength of the beams and to validate the hypotheses of the previously reported service-load tests. Companion specimens of concrete cylinders were tested for compressive strength and elastic modulus properties, for both sealed and unsealed conditions. Specimens of profiled steel-sheeting coupons and reinforcing steel bars were tested in tension to ascertain their yield stress and elastic modulus. The tests here are shown to verify the previously mentioned hypotheses and to provide benchmark results used to validate the theoretical predictions of a companion paper. Failure is shown to occur progressively through a combination of bond-slip failure and local buckling of the steel sheeting. The tests are then used to calibrate a theoretical model for the cross-sectional behavior of profiled composite beams. Local buckling was observed and is predicted by the use of a finite-strip method developed elsewhere.

AB - A simple cross-sectional analysis is developed based on the routine mechanics of materials to study the moment-curvature response and hence the ductility of a profiled composite beam. The material nonlinearities of the cold-formed steel and the concrete are used to determine an accurate description of the moment-curvature response. Parametric studies are made of the influence of material strengths and various cross-section geometries. The ramifications of these on the stiffness, strength, and ductility of profiled composite beams are discussed. The member behavior is then analyzed by using a simple numerical integration technique to obtain deflections throughout a beam. The theoretical model developed herein was verified for its accuracy against experimental data presented in the companion paper. The model was shown to agree well for both the linear and nonlinear ranges of loading with the experimental results recorded for the full-scale testing of two profiled composite beams to failure in a flexural mode.

AB - Web openings in beams occur quite often in practice to provide convenient passage of environmental services. As a result, story heights in buildings can be reduced resulting in major cost savings. In this paper the nonlinear analysis and design of simply supported posttensioned prestressed concrete beams with rectangular openings are presented. Several design parameters are varied such as: opening width and depth, horizontal and vertical locations of the opening, and type of cross section. The results from a nonlinear finite-element analysis are substantiated by test results from 13 unbonded posttensioned prestressed concrete beams, six of which are rectangular in section, five are T-section, and the remaining two are I-section. Good agreement is shown between the theoretical and the experimental results. The effect of the openings on the behavior of such beams at different stages of loading is presented. A simple design method for estimating the ultimate failure load for each type of failure mode is proposed. An illustrative design example is presented.

AB - Soil-structure interaction (SSI) can significantly alter the characteristics of recorded motions in buildings. The dominant frequency recorded in a building subjected to SSI is always smaller than the dominant frequencies of the fixed-base building, and of the foundation when no building is present. A building with SSI is a noncausal system because of the coupling between the motions of the foundation and the superstructure. The presence of SSI can be detected by investigating the causality of the building's impulse response. For causal systems, the amplitudes of the impulse response function at negative times are zero, whereas for noncausal systems they are comparable to those at positive times. The identification of SSI refers to extracting natural frequencies of the fixed-base building and the foundation from the recordings of the foundation and upper stories. The ratio of the Fourier amplitude spectrum of the top-story accelerations to that of the foundation accelerations permits the identification of the natural frequency of the fixed-base building. Two examples confirm the validity of the suggested methods. The first example involves a 10-story simulated building and its calculated response, whereas the second example involves a 30-story real-life building and its recorded response during a large earthquake.

AB - This paper presents a numerical method for predicting the influence of local buckling in component plates and distortional phenomenon on the ultimate strength of thin-walled, welded steel box girders curved in plan. A modified stress-strain curve allowing for local buckling of plate components is proposed. The effect of distortion is considered through incorporating additional strain in the reference stage of the incremental process in the nonlinear flexure analysis. Theoretical predictions obtained using the proposed method are compared to experimental test results. Nonlinear behavior of the test girders is illustrated and reasonable agreement between tests and theory is observed.
