AB - Strengthening of concrete structures in flexure with externally epoxy-bonded carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates is becoming an increasingly popular retrofit technique among researchers and engineers worldwide. A reliability study of such structures is the topic of this paper. First, considering the statistical character of the design variables (geometry, material properties), the effect of changes in these variables on the flexural capacity of CFRP-strengthened members is established. Variabilities in concrete strength and CFRP failure strain and area fraction are most influencial on flexural strength. Next, strength reduction factors are derived, with the aim of achieving a uniform reliability index of about three over a broad spectrum of design conditions. A general strength reduction factor φ= 0.80 is proposed. Finally, the effect of each design variable on the reliability of the system is examined and quantified in terms of the reliability index.

AB - According to Heyman's extension of limit design to masonry structures, the safety of stone arches is a purely geometrical matter, considering that it is almost always possible to assess that mean compressive stresses are low even in structures showing several cracks. Safety of stone arches require the load's thrust line to be anywhere within the arch profile. Different issues must be faced when considering dead and traveling loads. In the first case, a minimum thickness can be defined so as to contain the line of thrust. Considering traveling loads, the goal is to define a load factor such to turn the structure into a mechanism. In this paper, iterative methods to find the minimum thickness under dead loads and the collapse mechanism and load factor when acting also live loads are proposed. The results of a comprehensive numerical investigation are shown, which can be easily used in the safety check of stone arches.

AB - This paper reports the development of a new design guideline for the stair slabs, supported on the structural member spanning at right angle to the direction of the flight. The study is based on finite-element analyses of two common types of stairs, dog-legged and open-well stairs. Results of the finite-element investigation have been compared with the experimental findings, ensuring reliability of the predicted response. The stair slabs, usually supported on walls or beams at landing levels, derive significant rigidity from such supporting arrangement. This results in an efficient distribution of moment along the length of the flight. This distinctive feature of stair slab is not recognized by the leading codes of practice. In order to establish the characteristic behavior of stairs of the aforenamed types, a sensitivity study for the geometric parameters of the stair slab has been carried out. Based on the findings of the present study, a new design rationale for stair slab has been proposed. The guidelines presented here enable straightforward estimation of the design forces, which are generally overestimated by 300–400% when determined by the conventional design practices.

AB - There is a growing trend in constructing multistory garages and high-rise buildings where utility ducts are passed through openings in the floor beams. Accommodating the utility services in such a manner minimizes dead space. However, introducing an opening in the web of such beams reduces the beam stiffness and leads to a more complicated structural response. In this paper the dynamic analysis and design of simply supported and continuous prestressed concrete beams with rectangular openings are presented. Several design parameters are varied such as opening width and depth, horizontal and vertical locations of the opening, type of cross section, and presence of more than one opening. The analytical results were compared to test results in the literature. Good agreement was shown between the theoretical and the experimental results. An extensive parametric study was performed on prestressed beams with openings to determine the natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes. Simple methods are proposed to predict the dynamic response including the beam maximum deflection, deflection of the opening chords, and horizontal and vertical stresses at midspan and at the vicinity of the opening.

AB - The study presents the mechanics associated with the short-term behavior of glass-fiber reinforced-plastic (GFRP) box beams that include a layer of concrete and a carbon-fiber–reinforced-plastic laminate (CFRP) in the compression and the tension zone, respectively. This innovative concept results in cost-effective composite members with pseudoductile characteristics and high stiffness and strength properties. It can be thought of as a better way of producing composite structural members for simply supported spans, through an automated manufacturing technique such as pultrusion. The analytical results are verified by a series of bending tests on large-scale specimens and by the finite-element technique. The agreement between experiments and analysis was found quite satisfactory. A preliminary design procedure for the hybrid members is also presented, based on a complete set of stiffness, strength (flexural strength, web shear failure by either crushing or buckling, lateral instability), and ductility design requirements.

AB - The time-dependent behavior of a new class of hybrid elements consisting of glass-fiber–reinforced-plastic (GFRP) box beams combined with a layer of concrete in the compression flange and a carbon-fiber–reinforced-plastic laminate (CFRP) as additional tension reinforcement is presented in this study. Shrinkage, creep, and fatigue models for concrete are combined with creep and fatigue models for GFRP (based on both laminate theory and semiempirical approaches) to yield a general analysis procedure for predicting the deformation and residual strength response of hybrid GFRP/CFRP/concrete beams subjected to sustained and/or alternating loading. The analytical model predictions are compared with experimental results obtained from creep and fatigue testing of large-scale members, giving very good agreement. The present study shows that the new hybrid beams possess very good time-dependent response characteristics, and the models described here, along with those given in the companion paper for short-term behavior, can be used as analytical tools for the optimum design of such members under both short-term and long-term loading actions.

AB - The critical design decisions in bridge design are made at the preliminary design stage. They depend on the expertise of the designer, built up from extensive experience. Experience is difficult to acquire, and may be entirely lacking when new technology is introduced. As a result, there is little shareable and transferable collective design knowledge within the profession. This paper explores how preliminary design knowledge may be generated, updated, and used, employing techniques of machine learning from the field of artificial intelligence. A model of the preliminary design process is first presented as a sequence of five tasks and then specialized to the design of cable-stayed bridges. A computer tool serving as a design support system is described, whose design follows the model of the preliminary design process, and a design example using the tool is presented. The key property of the system is its adaptive nature: it acquires knowledge from information on existing bridges as well as from designs generated with the system, thereby continuously improving its performance. Future enhancements to the tool breadth and depth are offered.

AB - An efficient nonlinear stochastic finite-element method is proposed for the design of frame structures, specifically applicable to steel structures. The assumed stress-based finite-element method is used to compute nonlinear structural responses and the corresponding response gradients. Nonlinearities due to geometry, material, and partially restrained (PR) connections are considered in the algorithm. Elastoplastic material behavior is considered and the PR connections are modeled by the four-parameter Richard model. The material properties, geometry, connections parameters, and external loads are considered to be random variables. Both the strength and serviceability limit states are considered. The efficiency, robustness, desirability, and application potential of the method are demonstrated by two examples. Several observations with design implications can be made from these examples. Frames designed for strength may not be safe when serviceability is considered. The presence of PR connections makes the frame more flexible, and serviceability could become the governing limit state. It is essential to properly consider the PR connections in the analysis and design of frames, since design forces change significantly. In many cases, the member sizes may change considerably. The assumption that the connections are rigid, which is routinely used in the profession, is not appropriate. The proposed algorithm can be used as an alternative to the currently available methods to analyze and design frames, and to evaluate the corresponding reliabilities. The design is expected to be more efficient using this approach.

AB - Computer simulation was used to study the overload behavior of sheathed lumber systems. Simulations included in this study covered two-way action of the sheathing; partial composite action between the sheathing, connectors, and lumber members; the random mechanical properties of the lumber members; and the random postyield properties of the partial composite members. A trilinear spring model and a member-replacement technique were introduced to account for the nonlinear behavior of partial composite members. The primary factors affecting system overload behavior are the variation in the modulus of rupture of the lumber members and the three parameters that describe the postyield properties of the partial composite members. System-failure criteria are developed and are related to the same factors. A distinction is made between brittle-member systems and nonbrittle-member systems. The results apply for uniformly distributed loads applied to the system and do not include the effects of load duration.

AB - Systems for torsional stiffening, including longitudinal plate, transverse plate, box, and cross stiffeners of I-beams are reviewed. Different configurations for cross stiffeners are presented, including crosses fully formed on both sides of the beam, formed on one side only, or split with half of the cross on one side of the web and the other half of the cross on the other side of the web. The split-cross configuration is particularly desirable, being easy to fabricate but almost as effective as the full-cross configuration. Multiple butting and multiple overlapping cross stiffeners allow torsional stiffening along the entire length of a beam. Relationships for the mechanics of single butting, multiple butting, and multiple overlapping cross stiffeners are developed, and equivalent St. Venant's torsion constant are derived. Design parameters for cross stiffeners are reviewed and a stiffener slope of 45° is recommended. The effect of cross stiffeners on lateral torsional flexural buckling of I-beams is shown to significantly increase the beam capacity.

AB - A new relationship between the fracture energy of concrete, the tensile strength, and the ultimate crack width has been developed by considering the postcracking strength or softening of concrete. Linear, power, and exponential mathematical models were used to describe the descending branch of the stress-strain diagram. A nonlinear finite-element model was developed, using smeared cracks for a layered model approach. This facilitated the representation of the reinforced concrete and composite (steel and concrete) members that were analyzed to verify the modeling of the materials and a range of structures. The predictions of the load-deflection behavior of a reinforced concrete slab and a continuous composite beam in the elastic and inelastic range incorporated the fracture energy model, and the correlation between the theoretical and experimental results was very good. In a final evaluation, the fracture criteria of concrete and metals have been compared, and excellent correlation has been established between the inelastic behavior of the two very different materials.

A large displacement/large strain formulation is proposed for rubber materials considering a consistent penalty approach with gradually decreasing compressibility. Two stress-point plasticity algorithms are adopted to simulate the behavior of lead and steel materials. A practical idealization for passive control bearings is introduced based on a priori analytical and/or experimental information. The proposed procedure is verified against experimental results. The model is implemented for seismic energy dissipation of cable-stayed bridges.

AB - We report on the free and harmonically forced vibration responses of a rigid block rotating on a rigid surface. For free vibration, we compare the approximate quarter period for an initially open block with the exact quarter period, which we derive to be an elliptic integral of the first kind. The difference between the two periods increases as a block becomes less slender; however, the approximate solution improves as a function of an increasing initial rotation. The maximum error is 2.0% for a single segment of rotation for practical geometries. For harmonic excitation, we compare ensembles of time histories for linear and nonlinear responses. The poorly conditioned nature of the system emerges prominently when very small amplitude ( 
&lt;10 −4
) rocking is predicted and when the forcing amplitude to slenderness angle ratio is between 1.2 and 1.8. Parameter studies delineating between surviving and toppling reveal that models are least sensitive to slenderness angle and peak amplitude, more sensitive to rebound velocity coefficient, and most sensitive to block diagonal. This sensitivity is generally reduced when using the nonlinear model. We conclude the nonlinear model provides more robust results, even for slender blocks.
