AB - Identification of damage of structures has recently received considerable attention in the light of maintenance and retrofitting of existing structures under service loads and after natural disasters. In this respect, most of the previous system-identification studies considered structural models typically with not more than three degrees of freedom. Although many of these identification methods should work in principle, local damage detection of real structures remains an arduous task for reasons such as insensitivity of modal frequencies to local structural changes, oversimplification of the model, numerical difficulty in convergence, and inherent measurement noise. This paper presents an “improved condensation” method for identification of local damage of multistory frame buildings in terms of change in story stiffness. Static condensation is employed to reduce the system size. Identification is executed recursively on a remedial model, finally yielding integrity indices for all storys. By numerical simulation studies of a 12-story building with various noise levels, this method is shown to be feasible and computationally efficient. The efficacy of the method is further substantiated experimentally by damage detection of a 6-story laboratory model subjected to hammer tests.

AB - A failure mechanism in concrete plates reinforced in only one direction and subjected to the general in-plane forces is presented. This mechanism is derived by applying a flexible tensorial model, already used for plates reinforced in two orthogonal directions. Differentiations in the behavior of such plates compared to those reinforced in two orthogonal directions are revealed and interpreted. It has also been derived when the failure of plates is brittle, that is, occurring immediately after the cracking, and when the plates have considerable post cracking shear capacity. The failure mechanism obtained by the model presented is verified by comparing the theoretical predictions with the experimental results from reinforced concrete panels containing only longitudinal reinforcement and subjected to pure shear, uniaxial tension, or combined shear and uniaxial tension.

AB - It is common to use composite systems consisting of steel profiles and concrete slabs in modern steel framework structures. In this experimental study, the behavior and ultimate loads of composite beams with web concrete are investigated in the negative bending-moment zone. Test specimens with five various concrete qualities, four different steels as support reinforcements, two different but practically sized spans of 5 m and 3 m, and three different steel profiles with cross sections prepared with or without column elements have been tested. Serviceability limit states and ultimate limit states are both studied.

AB - The tests described in this paper are the second in a program carried out to determine the effectiveness of intermediate stiffeners in controlling the buckling modes of profiled steel decks. A series of specimens with “flat-hat” intermediate stiffeners were brake-pressed to designs that were chosen to ensure that the primary buckling mode took place in the elastic range and was not affected by plasticity. The specimens were loaded in pure bending, resulting in various buckling waveforms prior to ultimate failure through a plastic collapse mechanism. The experimentally determined buckling stresses are compared with studies performed using a computer analysis based on the finite-strip method. The existing design procedure for local buckling in Australian Standard AS1538-1988 and various methods involving distortional buckling are compared with the test results. A method of design accounting for the interaction of buckling modes and its effect on the ultimate moment capacity is proposed and compared with the test results.

AB - Because of torsion, the demanded strength and interstory drift at certain parts of the structure increase above those required by just translational deformation. These effects differ for elastic and inelastic behavior, tending to be larger when inelastic behavior involves a torsional mechanism of the structure. A clear contradiction exists in the present consideration of torsion effects during the design process because torsion effects are elastically considered, while most of the seismic code design methodology is based on the safety level earthquake (EQ). This paper shows that for a special class of buildings, the reduction in the building strength resulting from inelastic torsion can be obtained using the classical theorems of plastic analysis. By analyzing an auxiliary structure, a simplified formula for the reduction in strength due to inelastic torsion is obtained. Using this simplified formula, guidelines to control inelastic torsion during preliminary seismic design are offered.

AB - General considerations, a numerical procedure, and several examples for the optimization of corrugated claddings are presented. The objective of this study is to minimize bending stresses due to bending moment acting on the cladding by designing the appropriate profiles that satisfy the imposed dimensional constraints. A numerical procedure, termed the method of local variation, is proposed for a systematic improvement in the geometry of the optimized profile, and solutions are verified against some limiting cases. This method of local variation is used to optimize the cross-sectional geometry of corrugated cladding using constraints on the coverage, the contour length, and the height of the cross section. The procedure is also extended to include the effects of additional panels added to both sides or to one side only. The results indicate that the simple corrugated profile with no added panels is the most effective in terms of providing maximum section modulus for a given coverage and volume of material. The use of optimal core profiles has been shown to result in considerable improvement when compared to simple shapes.

AB - The dynamic response of two C 3 × 4.1 channel steel beams is evaluated in terms of the reduction in load-carrying capacity of the damaged state versus the undamaged stage. The beam specimens are sized and configured to have similar frequency response observed in actual bridges. Each beam is subjected to different damage scenarios, i.e., various types, locations, and degree of damage. For each scenario, the characteristics of the dynamic response are determined from acceleration measurements made during low-level free-vibration tests. A finite-element model was used to calculate the dynamic response of the simulated damaged structures. The experimental and analytical results are scrutinized to correlate increasing deterioration and changes in the dynamic response. Good correlations are found between the experiments and analysis. For each damage scenario, the yield and ultimate-load capacities of the test beams are defined by a damage index. Both experimental and numerical results indicate that there is less than 10% change in the natural frequencies at critical damage state.

AB - Neural network computing has recently been applied to structural engineering problems. Most of the published research is based on a back-propagation neural network (BPN), primarily due to its simplicity. The back-propagation algorithm, however, has a slow rate of learning and is therefore impractical for learning of complicated problems requiring large networks. In this paper, we present application of counterpropagation neural network (CPN) with competition and interpolation layers in structural analysis and design. To circumvent the arbitrary trial-and-error selection of the learning coefficients encountered in the counterpropagation algorithm, a simple formula is proposed as a function of the iteration number and excellent convergence is reported. The CPN is compared with the BPN using two structural engineering examples reported in recent literature. We found superior convergence property and a substantial decrease in the central processing unit (CPU) time for the CPN. In addition, CPN was applied to two new examples in the area of steel design requiring large networks with thousands of links. It is shown that CPN can learn complicated structural design problems within a reasonable CPU time.

AB - The techniques of discrete-field analysis are used to perform an elastic-stability analysis of a three-dimensional X-braced lattice used as a compression member. Regardless of the number of joints in the system, the solution for the critical buckling load is reduced to solving for the eigenvalues of a 5 × 5 matrix. The formulation thus derived is used to develop a series of curves showing the critical buckling load for various X-braced–lattice configurations and geometries. A comparison of the critical buckling loads for the X-braced lattice indicates that the modified Euler buckling load may vary up to 30% from the loads obtained by the discrete-field–analysis method. The study also shows that as the number of panels increases from four to 32, the buckling-load ratios also increased. The X-braced–lattice depth will affect the buckling load of the lattice system. Variations in chord-member areas create variations in buckling-load ratios. The effects on the buckling ratios of the last two factors tends to diminish as the number of panels increases.

Based on a recursive formulation, the present method always finds buckling loads as roots of a 2 × 2 eigendeterminant, regardless of the number of layers of the laminated plate being considered. Detailed numerical results dealing with axisymmetric buckling of plates made of either homogeneous or laminated material are presented and discussed. The buckling mode shapes for selected problems are also presented.

AB - The seismic performance of various retrofit schemes for nonductile reinforced concrete (RC) frames is investigated using inelastic static and dynamic response analyses of three prototype buildings. The structures considered for study contain typical reinforcing details of older frames and represent low- and medium-rise construction in regions of high seismicity in the United States. Retrofit schemes included the installation of posttensioned bracing, structural steel bracing, or infill walls of reinforced concrete. Dynamic analyses were conducted for five ground motions representative of major earthquakes on firm and soft soil conditions. Response of the original and retrofitted buildings is evaluated in terms of maximum displacements, interstory drifts, and predicted member behavior. The results show that there is no unique solution and that several different retrofit schemes can be designed to provide adequate performance. However, satisfactory performance was obtained only for schemes that controlled lateral drifts to levels that would not result in significant damage to existing gravity-load–carrying elements.

AB - This paper presents the results of an experimental and analytical evaluation of one-way reinforced-concrete pier hinges subjected to a combination of axial compression, shear, and moment in the strong direction. Thirty-four specimens consisting of columns, shear specimens, and compression specimens were tested. The variables were the aspect ratio of columns, arrangement of steel in the hinge region, and thickness of hinge throat. The columns were subjected to cyclic loads, but other specimens were subjected to monotonic loads. Analyses of the hinged columns involved the determination of lateral-load strength, energy-dissipation capacity, shear slippage, and the compressive strength of the concrete in the hinge region. The test data showed that the behavior of column hinges with bundled and diagonal bars was similar to that of the hinges with equally spaced straight bars. Regardless of the reinforcement detail, flexure dominated the lateral load even in specimens with an aspect ratio of 1. It was also shown that the column and footing confine the concrete in the hinge throat, and that the strength of the concrete is enhanced by at least 25%. A simple method to determine the moment capacity of one-way hinges is presented and evaluated using the measured data.

AB - This paper reviews the code development procedures used for the new load and resistance factor design (LRFD) bridge code. The new code is based on a probability-based approach. Structural performance is measured in terms of the reliability (or probability of failure). Load and resistance factors are derived so that the reliability of bridges designed using the proposed provisions will be at the predefined target level. The paper describes the calibration procedure (calculation of load and resistance factors). A new live load model is proposed, which provides a consistent safety margin for a wide spectrum of spans. The dynamic load model takes into account the effect of road roughness, bridge dynamics, and vehicle dynamics. Statistical models of resistance (load-carrying capacity) are summarized for noncomposite steel, composite steel, reinforced concrete, and prestressed concrete. The reliability indices for bridges designed using the proposed code are compared with the reliability indices corresponding to the current specification. The proposed code provisions allow for a consistent design with a uniform level of reliability.

AB - This paper reports on an examination and comparison of the bridge-design advice given in the 1991 book  Bridge Aesthetics Around the World
 by 24 of the world's best-known and respected authorities on bridge-design aesthetics. Although these authorities use various terminologies, comparisons, analogies, and illustrations to discuss the subject of bridge design, it has been found that a majority of them emphasize and discuss only a limited number of primary bridge-design concepts. Chief among these is the concept of bridge/place integration and the use of a contextual-design approach to help achieve such integration. For large and unique structures, they emphasize the importance of a structurally expressive form and simultaneity in design to achieve such a form. With a number of reservations and warnings, a bare majority of these authorities recommend the use of bridge aesthetic guidelines as a means of achieving bridge designs that will be visually suitable for their settings. Finally, the paper identifies and synthesizes the major abstractions appearing in this collection of outstanding papers into an abstraction hierarchy. Consequently, the paper provides a comprehensive glimpse of the present world view of bridge-design aesthetics.
