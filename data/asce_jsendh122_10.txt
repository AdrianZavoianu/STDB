AB - This paper proposes a spectral difference method to estimate the maximum relative displacement between adjacent elastic structures subjected to seismic traveling waves. The method, based on random vibration theory, seeks the cross-correlation between the responses of adjacent structures subjected to differential earthquake excitation with time lag. The results of computer simulation with 15 earthquake records show a good agreement between the proposed spectral analysis and time-history analysis. The relations between the maximum relative displacement of adjacent structures and their vibration periods, damping, as well as the time lag of earthquake excitations are clarified using the closed form solution obtained. Time lag of the excitations among adjacent structures alters the correlation and phase of vibration of the adjacent structures. The cross-correlation coefficient explained herein captures this aspect. Its magnitude under nonzero time lag can be very different from that under zero time lag. In some instances, these coefficients can have different signs. This leads to a significant change in the peak relative displacement of adjacent structures. These are especially true when the structures are subjected to surface waves; they rest on soft soils where low wave velocities develop, and their supports are remotely located.

AB - Pounding between closely spaced structures can be a serious hazard in seismically active metropolitan areas. One of the key issues is estimating the required separation distance to avoid or reduce pounding of adjacent structures that vibrate either elastically or inelastically. Series of dynamic time history analyses can estimate this distance by obtaining the maximum relative distance of the adjacent structures. However, this paper proposes an alternative and more attractive method, called the “spectral difference (SPD) method,” based on a spectrum approach. The method accounts for phasing associated with vibration of adjacent structures, defined as “vibration phase.” The paper also proposes simplified rules to predict the inelastic vibration phase, and demonstrates the accuracy of the SPD method for a variety of adjacent building pairs and earthquakes. Unlike the time history analysis method, the SPD method clarifies the effects of various parameters on the relative displacement through a closed-form solution. The SPD method is also useful for various relative displacement problems between adjacent structures, such as bridges. It is more accurate than the current code calculation method that ignores the vibration phase.

AB - This work presents the results of an extensive numerical study on the nonlinear response of bridges subjected to multisupport seismic excitation. Bridges of varying stiffness and ductility have been designed both for nonsynchronous motion and, as in current engineering practice, for synchronous motion, and have been subsequently analyzed in the nonlinear range under nonsynchronous input motion. The purpose of the study has been to assess the effects on the peak inelastic response of bridge structures and the extent of validity of the force reduction factor ( q
-factor) approach for the design. The results show that displacement ductility demands in bridges designed by the  q
-factor method for a multisupport excitation are in good accordance with the selected value of  q
. The bridges designed for synchronous input and then checked for nonsynchronous motion exhibit an excess of strength in the central piers, whereas the opposite occurs for those close to the abutments, which may have displacement ductility demands larger than those requested under synchronous motion.

AB - A quantitative approach follows for developing a methodology for the rapid seismic evaluation and ranking of slab-on-girder steel highway bridges. In the development of this methodology, analytical expressions are introduced to calculate the seismically induced forces and displacements in bridge components, first assuming that damage to bearings is not acceptable and then removing this constraint. In the latter case, the superstructure is assumed to become unrestrained and slide on its supports. The seismic screening of the bridges is based on the calculation of a ranking index defined as the product of an importance index and overall damage index. Unlike other existing methodologies, the overall damage index of the structure is determined considering the impact of damage to each component on the successive failure of other components and structure as a whole. A cut-off mechanism is introduced to prevent the potentially undue impact some dominating societal aspects could have on the ranking of existing bridges with otherwise excellent seismic-resistance adequacy. The proposed methodology also quantitatively addresses the risk inherent to all seismic hazard zones.

AB - The purpose of this experimental study is to investigate the influences of the filled-in concrete on the strength, ductility and energy absorption capacity of the column. A total of 12 concrete-filled steel box column specimens modeling steel bridge piers were tested under a constant compressive axial load and cyclic lateral loads. In designing the specimens, the plate width-thickness ratio, slenderness ratio and length of the filled-in concrete were chosen as main parameters. Moreover, the effect of the diaphragm over the concrete, on the column behavior was also examined. The collapse characteristics of tested specimens were presented in detail to provide some useful information for understanding of their inelastic behavior under cyclic loading. Test results were also discussed in the light of improvement of ductility and energy-absorption capacity of steel bridge piers. It is concluded that concrete-filled steel box columns can be effectively used as bridge substructures in strong earthquake areas.

AB - This paper presents the results of shaking table studies on the inelastic behavior of two identical 2/5-scale three-story steel structures, one with and the other without viscoelastic (VE) dampers. The VE dampers were designed to provide the test structure with 8% and 15% critical damping ratios, respectively, at an ambient temperature of 28°C. Test results show that the VE dampers were effective in reducing the overall response and ductility demand on the test structure under strong earthquake ground motions. The structure with dampers sustained much stronger earthquake ground motions and experienced less damage than did the structure without dampers. During the tests, the VE dampers experienced large shear strains far beyond their design value of 60% strain and the usual design limit such as 100% strain. Analytical results show that damping ratios of the viscoelastically damped structure can be accurately predicted by the modal strain energy method. The inelastic seismic response can also be well described by using bilinear elements for the structural members. Results from this study suggest that a viscoelastically damped structure with sufficiently large damping may remain elastic under strong earthquake ground motions.

AB - Results from seismic analyses performed on 20-story ductile coupled-shear-wall models designed for Montreal, Canada, are presented. A two-dimensional model was used to idealize the structure including the supporting ground. Allowances were made for nonlinearities not only in the walls and the coupling beams, but also in the soil and foundation elements. The soil foundation was modeled by equivalent massless springs (hangers), located at the base of the structures, allowing for inelastic bearing of the soil and loss of contact (uplift) of base from supporting soil. The stiffnesses of massless foundation springs were obtained using the soil properties that were derived on the basis of strain-dependent shear moduli of real borings. The study showed that the model is capable of tracing the response of coupled shear wall, taking into account the soil-structure interaction effects. Results showed that allowing for foundation flexibility lengthened the fundamental period by a maximum of 33; it amplified deflections by a maximum of 81. However the stresses in the walls and the coupling beams attenuated particularly in lower stories. Finally, no substantial variations were observed in the rotational ductility demands of the coupling beams.

AB - A structural mixture theory is developed for use in predicting the response of a structural frame to earthquake ground motion. The frame is considered to be a mixture of columns and beams and is modeled as two interacting subsystems. The dynamic response of each subsystem is described by its own linear differential operator. The two responses are then subjected to matching conditions (i.e., boundary conditions) which couple them at the subsystem interface. The conditions include damping ratios, moment-of-inertia ratios, frequency ratios, and the effects of relative node/support motion. The solution of the coupled equations is carried out by means of a pair of coupled perturbation series. Example results from the numerical implementation of the theory are given, and compared with the result of the corresponding calculation using the Wilson-θ method and observed earthquake response. The structural mixture theory is valid for multiple-degree-of-freedom structures under the type of ground motions used in this study, and it appears to be applicable to systems with linear or nonlinear behavior.

AB - Seismic design provisions, including the Chilean seismic code, prescribe seismic design forces by reducing a linear elastic response spectra using a response modification factor. The codes also estimate expected maximum inelastic displacement that may occur during a severe earthquake, by amplifying the elastic displacement computed from the design seismic forces by a displacement amplification factor. In this paper, the seismic force reduction factor  R w and displacement amplification factor  C d are computed for typical confined masonry buildings, comparing base shear and first-story drift that develop in the structure when linear or nonlinear behavior is adopted. The computations are performed after analyzing several three and four story buildings. These buildings were subjected to the action of a number of earthquakes records obtained in Chile on March 3, 1985 and in Mexico on Sept. 19, 1985. The  R w factor, evaluated for this type of building, depends both on the structure's wall density and on the source mechanism of the earthquake; in contrast to most code recommendations, the ratio of  R w/C d obtained is less than 1.

AB - The effective length approach for column stability evaluation has long played an important role in approximate methods of analysis. Methods for determination of effective lengths of compression members in frame systems are examined and discussed in terms of exact results and general principles of mechanics of buckling. Conventional rotational restraint factors in the general case are found to be less than accurate. Such factors include the well known  G (or ψ) term, defined as the relative joint stiffness ratio. The vertical interaction between compression members below and above a joint, as implied by the conventional  G-term, are shown to be conceptually flawed. The novel concept of a restraint demand factor is introduced, to allow for improved development of vertical interaction in member stability terms, including effective length predictions. Conventional and alternative restraint demand factors are compared to exact solutions for a realistically wide range of frame parameters. Sources of inaccuracies are identified and quantified, and limits of applicability are suggested.

AB - The mechanical behavior of wood is strongly dependent on factors such as species, grade, moisture content, and member size as well as on time effects such as duration of load and creep. Time-dependent phenomena, combined with the variability inherent in a biological material, make it challenging to definitively evaluate the long-term performance of wood structures in general through experimental testing programs. In analytical studies of wood systems, damage accumulation and viscoelastic stress-strain models have been used to account for time-dependent effects. Recent structural reliability studies on wood systems have used these types of models to include time-dependent phenomena in the assessment of reliability indices for various strength and serviceability limit states. Structural reliability studies produce a notional estimate of the expected frequency of exceedance for a particular limit state, but they do not reveal information on the process leading to that limit-state failure. In the present study, the performance of light-frame–dimension lumber wood-floor systems is investigated using a time-dependent Monte Carlo simulation for combined dead and occupancy live loads throughout a 50 year design lifetime. Particular attention is paid to the relative frequency and temporal characteristics of joist ruptures predicted by commonly accepted duration-of-load models. The results of the study provide insight into probable long-term wood-system behavior and can help to further the development of appropriate design, inspection, and maintenance procedures.

The governing differential equations and the boundary integral method are used to obtain exact expressions for axial, torsional, and flexural stiffnesses. The necessary fixed-end forces and moments are also derived. The procedure of the proposed method is explained through a practical class of tapered members. The procedure, however, can be extended to other axial, torsional, and flexural stiffness variations. The correctness of the obtained stiffness expressions is verified through numerical examples.

AB - Dome-shaped space trusses can be derived from a flat configuration by means of posttensioning. The structure considered here is devised to be a near mechanism initially and during the posttensioning operation. It is a near mechanism as only the flexural stiffness of the continuous top chords provides any resistance to deformation. Therefore, no appreciable force is induced in the members of the structure during the shape formation process. The results of experimental and theoretical work on the shape formation of a dome-shaped space truss by means of posttensioning are presented herein. An analytical  procedure that includes both geometric and material nonlinearities is developed to determine the final shape of the dome-shaped space truss, using commercially available finite-element software. The ultimate aim is to lead to significant economies in the construction of large-span lightweight structures by eliminating or minimizing the need for scaffolding and heavy cranes in the shaping and erection of such structures.

AB - Over the past four years, Lucent Technologies (formerly AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories) has funded a research project that is aimed at determining the feasibility of using a computer to simulate the dynamic response of its digital access and cross-connect systems when subjected to design earthquake loadings. In this work, coarse finite element models are demonstrated to be accurate in calculating the resonant frequencies and corresponding modes of vibration for these structural systems. Through further comparisons with actual shake table tests performed at Wyle Laboratories in Huntsville, Ala., this technology is also proven adequate in calculating earthquake response behavior. It is expected that the research summarized in this paper will provide structural and mechanical engineers in the telecommunications field a basis for applying computer simulation as an earthquake design tool.
