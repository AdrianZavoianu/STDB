AB - This paper presents practical advanced analysis methods for two-dimensional unbraced steel frame design. Three methods for practical design are developed and refined: (1) an explicit imperfection modeling method; (2) an equivalent notional load method; and (3) a further-reduced tangent modulus method. The magnitudes of geometric imperfections for unbraced frames are proposed. The strengths predicted by the proposed methods are compared with those predicted by the exact plastic-zone method as well as the conventional load resistance factor design (LRFD) method. The displacement predictions are also compared with those of the plastic-zone solutions. Analysis and design guidelines in using the proposed methods are given in detail. Member sizes determined by the proposed methods are compared with those determined by the LRFD method. A good agreement is generally observed. The proposed methods can be used for unbraced frame design without the tedious separate member capacity checks, including the calculation of K-factor. The methods are recommended for general use.

AB - This paper presents three practical advanced analysis procedures for a two-dimensional braced steel frame design. These procedures can be used to assess realistically both strength and behavior of a structural system and its individual members in a direct manner. As a result, the procedures can be used for design without tedious separate member capacity checks, including the calculations of  K
-factor. Herein, key factors influencing steel frame behavior are described (including gradual yielding associated with flexure; residual stresses; second-order effects; and geometric imperfections) and simple procedures to enable designers to assess this behavior are provided. The procedures incorporate the refined plastic-hinge concept for spread of plasticity together with practical modelings for geometric imperfections. The strengths predicted by the proposed procedures are then compared with those predicted by the exact plastic-zone analysis as well as by the conventional LRFD procedure. A case study is also given for a braced frame. It is concluded that the proposed procedures are suitable for adoption in practice.

AB - Approximate methods for determination of effective lengths of compression members in frame systems are normally based on rotational restraints defined through so-called joint stiffness ratios or  G
-factors. These approaches allow the member to be considered in isolation from the rest of the frame. However, they are known to be inaccurate in many cases. A method is proposed that involves postprocessing of effective lengths from isolated column analyses to arrive at improved, weighted mean values. The approach, termed the method of means, satisfies general system instability principles, is attractively simple, and yields in general effective length predictions in excellent agreement with exact results for a wide variation of parameters. The errors are normally within a few percent of exact solutions. The method is applicable to braced and to a range of unbraced frames. It is particularly suitable for cases where drastic changes of beam or column stiffness occur, such as in the top or bottom stories of a frame, or where column stiffness, axial force level, and story height change at certain floor levels.

AB - On Oct. 17, 1989, a tall, steel-framed, San Francisco office building with 47 above-grade stories was excited by the Loma Prieta earthquake. The building response was recorded by accelerometers maintained by the California Division of Mines and Geology Strong Motion Instrumentation Program. From the records, important characteristics of the building response can be identified. In this paper, a computationally efficient, approximate dynamic analysis of the building using a reduced-order continuum model is conducted. By making use of the repetitive nature of the lattice framing system, finite-element models generated using continuum methodology have significantly fewer degrees of freedom than models generated using classical discrete finite-element techniques. These reduced-order models can therefore lead to significant savings in the computational effort and cost typically associated with dynamic analyses of large structures. The vibrational characteristics of the continuum model, as well as the results of the dynamic analysis, are compared to the building's recorded response. The continuum model is accurate in capturing the dominant periods of vibration as well as the time-history response and shows promise as a tool for preliminary design of large lattice structures.

AB - The strength and ductility of steel frames depend strongly on the behavior of their beam-to-column connections. The fracture of beam-to-column connections of steel buildings in the Northridge Earthquake generated concern about the reliability of current design and construction technology on steel connections. There is an urgent need to find a reliable method to retrofit these connections and to use it for the design of new buildings. A simple method is proposed here to enhance the ductility of beam-to-column connections. On trimming the beam flanges slightly, the ductility of the connection can be improved greatly. Experimental study of the newly designed connections under cyclic load shows that the ultimate strengths are almost unaltered, whereas the stiffness is decreased only slightly. However, the plastic rotational capacity can be increased several times. Moreover, the fracture proneness of connections due to welding sensitivity and stress concentration from abrupt geometry alternation can be minimized and the energy dissipation capacity can be improved. A shaking table test of a steel frame designed according to the proposed connection method also behaves better than that of a conventional moment-resisting frame.

AB - An analytical procedure is proposed to establish the nonlinear moment-rotation ( M
-Φ) characteristics for the bolted end-plate connections in flexibly jointed steel frames. The connection characteristics are assumed to depend on the component behavior of the tension zone, the compression zone, and the shear zone. The column flange and end plate with each bolt row in the tension zone are considered as a series of T-stub assembly with the effective length recommended by the Eurocode 3. Based on the beam and yield-line theory, the elastoplastic force-deformation relationship for each T-stub assembly is derived. With the consideration of the deformation of column web in compression and shear zone, the connection rotation Φ under bending moment  M
 is evaluated accordingly. The proposed analytical model is compared with some experimental results of extended and flush end-plate connections, and the feasibility and validation of the proposed model are demonstrated.

AB - A finite element methodology is employed in the investigation of the behavioral characteristics of the end-plate connections. In order for the actual behavior to be simulated correctly and effectively, a three-dimensional (3D) model is established with nonconforming 3D elements. The elastoplastic nonconforming solid elements with variable nodes are used for the effective and economic 3D finite element modeling and analysis. The effect of bolt pretensioning and the shapes of the bolt shank, head, and nut are taken into consideration in the modeling. A simple yet efficient contact algorithm with a new gap element is employed to simulate the interaction between the end plate and column flange. The prototype end-plate connection is analyzed with the refined 3D finite element model and is verified by comparison with results from one particular test.

AB - The composite steel-concrete beam-columns in which steel shapes are encased in concrete and second-order effects are significant were studied from 16 specimens loaded to failure. Loading included combinations of axial and transverse forces producing a wide range of different external eccentricities. Observations from the physical tests indicate that, for static loads, the bonding condition at the interface of steel rib connectors and the surrounding concrete has a small effect on ultimate strength. The tests also show that the ACI 318 assumption of maximum usable strain of 0.003 at concrete extreme compression fibers near ultimate load is valid for such beam-columns. Analyses based on ACI 318, Eurocode 4, and finite-element modeling procedures were compared to test results that provided further insight into understanding the structural behavior of such beam-columns.

AB - This paper presents the development of a polynomial equation to represent the three-dimensional (3D) cross-section strength of square or rectangular concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) beam-columns. The equation provides an accurate representation of the cross-section strength of a CFT subjected to a combination of axial force, strong axis flexure, and weak axis flexure. This expression is verified against the results of a detailed fiber analysis formulation, and against experimental tests of short, square CFTs available in the literature. This CFT cross-section strength equation forms a compact expression of the failure surface of square or rectangular CFTs having a wide range of cross-section dimensions and material strengths. The cross-section strength surface also provides the basis for a bounding-surface concentrated plasticity model in 3D force space for CFT beam-columns, presented in related work by the writers. This beam-column model, in turn, is suitable for conducting monotonic static, cyclic static, or transient dynamic seismic analysis of complete composite unbraced frame structures composed of steel I-girders framing biaxially into CFT beam-columns.

AB - The fatigue strength of beams with tapered cover plates was investigated both experimentally and analytically. The test specimens were precracked and then repaired with one of the following three methods: a friction type bolted splice plate connection, air-hammer peening along the weld toe, and a hybrid of the previous two called the partial bolted splice connection. Test results demonstrated that the bolted splice connection was the most effective repair method. Cracked cover plate ends repaired with a bolted splice connection, partial bolted splice connection, and air-hammer peening demonstrated an increase in fatigue life equal to categories B, C, and D of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) specifications, respectively. Air-hammer peening was found to be particularly effective if applied to noncracked cover plate ends, with an increase in fatigue life equal to category B′. An analytical model was developed to predict the propagation life of cracked cover plate ends repaired with one of the three repair methods.

AB - Design of steel transmission poles is formulated as an optimization problem by identifying design variables, a cost function, and constraints. Nonlinearities in structural response calculations due to large deflections are included in the formulation. An example problem available in the literature is solved and the solution is compared with the published one. Several other cases of the example are solved to investigate the effect of certain parameters on optimal design as well as to show the flexibility of the optimal design process. Based on the results of this study, it is concluded that the optimal design process can give more economic designs compared to the conventional design process. Once the optimal design problem is formulated and implemented into a software, many variations in the problem conditions and parameters can be studied in a relatively short time, which can lead to better designs.

AB - In the aftermath of the 1994 Northridge earthquake, extensive field investigations revealed damage in wood frame construction in the form of splitting of the 2 × 4 or 2 × 6 wood sill plates along the line of anchor bolts that typically connect shear walls to the masonry or concrete foundation. Due to the severity of such brittle failures, the city of Los Angeles has recently restricted the use of 2× dimension lumber in sill plates and requires the use of 3× dimension lumber. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the performance of 2× dimension lumber sill plate connections at the yield and ultimate limit states during incremental quasi-static reversed cyclic loading and suggests possible cost-effective retrofit strategies for their improved seismic performance without having to increase the sill plate thickness. Proposed retrofit strategies are based on providing confinement to the sill plate using metal reinforcing straps and reinforcing clamps to increase the deformation capability and energy dissipation capacity of the connection, while maintaining substantial levels of connection strengths.

AB - ASCE Standard 7, “Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures,” and the “NEHRP/BSSC Recommended Provisions for Seismic Regulations for Buildings” both contain load requirements for earthquake-resistant structural design. Many of the NEHRP provisions are being implemented in building codes and are the basis for the seismic load provisions in Chapter 9 of ASCE 7. However, the treatment of combinations of earthquake and snow loads differs in the ASCE 7 and NEHRP documents. Concerns regarding these differences were raised during the balloting of both the ASCE 7-93 and ASCE 7-95 provisions. To address these concerns, the load combination requirements involving dead, snow and earthquake load in these two resource documents were examined using modern probabilistic load models and load combination techniques. It is found that approximately 20% of the nominal snow load should be considered in combining snow and earthquake loads.

AB - In thin-walled open-section beams made of fiber-reinforced laminates, symmetric with respect to their midplane, the bending and torsion are coupled. For this type of structural members, a nonlinear finite-element (NLFE) analysis based on the updated Lagrangian formulation is developed to solve the problem, numerically. The solution could further be expanded for bifurcation and buckling type of problems in composites. The linear and geometric nonlinear stiffness matrices are presented. The displacements of simply supported and cantilever composite channels due to static concentrated loads, applied at the midspan and the end, respectively, are measured and compared with the NLFE solution. The experimental results are in good agreement with the results of the finite-element analysis.

AB - In thin-walled open sections made of composite material, symmetric with respect to their midplane, the bending and torsion are coupled. In this paper, new equivalent moduli of elasticity and rigidity are introduced for this type of material to allow decoupling of the relative differential equations. Therefore, for analysis of composite thin-walled members, the Vlasov relations with the new equivalent moduli could be used. In other words, the material could be treated as an isotropic and homogeneous one. As a result, the required computation efforts and time could be minimized. The results of two examples, presented in this paper, are in good agreement with the finite-element solution developed in the companion paper.

AB - A number of investigators have proposed semiempirical formulas for the critical buckling load of slender columns. The departure from the assumptions of the elastic-plastic theory makes the task of incorporating all the features of real-life columns into a single formula very difficult. As a result, semiempirical formulas, adopted for design specifications often follow a lower bound to experimental observations to include a variety of column types. Therefore, a significant portion of the actual column strength remains unutilized, when such a lower bound is adopted in the design of axially compressed members. This technical note reports development of a tool for the prediction of buckling load of columns, which requires minimum assumptions using neural computing techniques. This concept can be extended to include a variety of column types in a single model for the buckling load of columns. This concept can also be further extended for reliability analysis as the network can also predict the standard deviation in the column strength.
