AB - The Committee on Design of Steel Building Structures of the Committee on Metals of the Structural Division of ASCE is engaged in an ongoing program to study and resolve structural engineering issues faced by the designers of steel buildings. The results of this work are being presented to the profession in a series of papers, of which this is the second. The first paper was published in the December 1992 issue of the  Journal of Structural Engineering under the title “Compendium of Design Office Problems.” The emphasis is on practical solutions that the designer can use directly, without further research. Each issue is listed separately, with a technical discussion of the problem followed by a suggested solution, with references where appropriate. In addition, topics currently under study are listed, as are subjects identified by the Committee as needing investigation.

AB - The current specifications for fatigue design of hollow structural section (HSS) connections are both outdated, and, in view of recent research results fairly inaccurate. Analyses of a large number of connections have been carried out, incorporating results from other researchers. The result is this paper, which contains an outline for improved fatigue design guidelines for HSS structures that are welded directly together without the use of additional stiffeners. To clarify the use of these guidelines and show the difference between the proposed and existing design methods, three HSS connections are analyzed with existing design guidelines as well as with the proposed guidelines.

AB - This study investigates damage process to steel structural members after buckling by subjecting them to large repetitive deformations such as strong earthquake loading up to the ultimate cracking state. Experiments were conducted on steel angle members that were subjected to very low cycle loading that caused global and/or local buckling and plastic elongation. In this study, very low cycle loading means repetitive loading, five to 20 loading cycles, within the large plastic range. The objective of the experiments was to quantify the relationships of the important physical factors relating cracks and ruptures to large repetitive deformations. Also, a nonlinear finite-element-method analysis was performed to trace the experimental behavior of the steel structural members. Both the experimental and analytical results are comprehensively discussed with emphasis placed on the crack initiation process at the local buckling location. It is found that the FEM analysis effectively clarifies the detailed behavior of the steel members that has not been observed through the experiments, especially the behavior of local stress-strain histories at their cracking parts.

AB - This paper studies the implication of the tendon modeling on the global response of tension leg platforms (TLPs) in general, and on the surge motion (low-frequency response) and the limits of the tendon forces (high-frequency response) in particular. The tendons are modeled as massless elastic springs connected to the hull or as flexural beam elements with mass and hydrodynamic forces. For the latter, a complete nonlinear large-displacement coupled analysis is performed. The TLP studied is subjected to regular waves with various heights and periods in different water depths. Among other conclusions, the results show that while the simple elastic spring modeling of the tendons with constant lateral stiffness is satisfactory in computing the surge response (horizontal motion) amplitude, the hydrodynamic forces on the tendons are very important in accurately predicting the surge mean value (offset). The hull setdown (vertical displacement associated with the horizontal motion) also significantly affects the tendon forces, particularly for not very deep water.

AB - The calculation of the deflection of a reinforced concrete element is usually troublesome, and is even more problematic for two-way slabs than for beams. An algebraic equation was developed in this paper for estimating the midpanel deflections of the two-way slab systems subjected to uniform gravity loads. The proposed method was initially derived from the differential equation of plate and then calibrated using the results of finite-element analyses to estimate the elastic deflections of interior panels. The proposed procedure was further directed toward the general problem concerning progressive cracking of concrete, varied boundary conditions due to discontinuity of slab, and long-term effects. The resulting expression provides a more accurate representation of the midpanel deflection than does the simpler method outlined in the ACI Committee 435 report. The adequacy of the proposed procedure was checked by comparing calculated deflections with experimental data reported in previous literature, and satisfactory correlation was found. Finally, this paper includes numerical examples to illustrate use of the proposed equations.

AB - Limitation of midpanel deflection is an essential performance design of two-way slab systems. Two alternative design procedures for deflection control are presented in this paper. One procedure with fewer parameters is written in a format of the minimum thickness requirements. The other, allowing more flexibility in choices, involves the direct calculation of midpanel deflections. Both procedures suggested herein are simple; however, various factors influencing deflections of two-way slab systems (i.e., loading intensity, slab geometrical configuration, material properties, cracking phenomenon, slab discontinuity, long-term effects, and allowable deflection limits) are also considered. These techniques are provided with illustrative examples as well as comparisons with both the available experimental data and  ACI 318-89
 being made.

AB - An upper-bound analysis of reinforced-concrete continuous deep beams is presented. The concrete is assumed as a rigid–perfectly plastic material obeying the modified Coulomb failure criteria with zero tension cutoff. Two collapse modes are considered, each idealized as an assemblage of rigid blocks moving in plane, separated by yield zones. These zones are idealized as lines, the limiting case of narrow zones of failing material undergoing very high strains. Calibration of the computed failure loads against the experimental failure loads for 20 test beams produces the value of the effectiveness factor for concrete in compression for this type of structure. The effectiveness factor may be allowed to vary with the concrete strength and the amount of web reinforcement, but this provides little improvement over the adoption of a uniform value. The effect of the horizontal and vertical web reinforcement on the load capacity is mainly influenced by the shear span to depth ratio. The deeper the beam, the less effective the vertical web reinforcement, and the more effective the horizontal web reinforcement.

AB - Based on the theory of continuous sliding-mode control, control methods are presented for seismic-excited buildings isolated by a frictional-type sliding-isolation system. The dynamic behavior of the building equipped with a base-sliding-isolation system is highly nonlinear, and the sliding-mode–control method is ideal for such nonlinear systems. In addition to full-state-feedback controllers, a simple static-output-feedback controller using only the measured information from a few sensors installed at strategic locations without an observer is presented. The continuous sliding-mode controllers presented do not have undesirable chattering effect. Simulation results for an eight-story building indicate that (1) the control methods are robust; and (2) the control performance is outstanding. A shaking-table experimental program was conducted to verify the proposed static output control method. For the shaking-table tests, a three-story quarter-scale building model was mounted on a base mate that was supported by four frictional bearings. Experimental test results indicate that the control performance is quite remarkable, although a slight degradation was observed due to noise pollution and system time delays.

AB - Heavy truck traffic on highway bridges is known to produce impact loads that cause large vibrations. This phenomenon can reduce the expected service life of many highway bridges. A means to mitigating those deleterious vibrations using an automatic control system that requires no pumps or line power is proposed. A semiactive hydraulic bridge vibration absorber that can be retrofitted to an existing bridge is described. The bridge/vehicle system is modeled, and a practical feedback control that uses either strain-gauge or accelerometer readings to sense the state of the system is synthesized. The results of an experimental test of the new system indicates reductions of peak amplitudes of 65–70%.

AB - A method is presented to efficiently approximate the failure probability of structures subjected to time-variant loads, where the system of loads and structure may have uncertain parameters. The method uses response surface methodology in conjunction with the fast integration technique suggested by Wen and Chen, to provide a limit-state formulation that is computationally simple to solve based on a small number of response  time histories. The system reliability may then be quickly computed by first-order reliability method (FORM)/ second-order reliability method (SORM) or Monte Carlo simulation. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the effect on the failure probability of changes to the system parameters, which can be important when determining whether uncertainty in a given system parameter is significant. An empirical measure of the accuracy of the response surface approximation is presented.

AB - Various statistical methods of estimating the characteristic strengths of materials or structural components from the results of experimental tests can be assessed in the figures and tables of this paper. The methods are tested on normal, log-normal, and two-parameter Weibull populations as well as data sets from timber engineering activities. The results show how the required sample size depends on the coefficient of variation and the likely errors if an incorrect distribution is assumed. Two statistical methods that effectively fit distributions to the lower tails of experimental results, with the consequence that the estimations of characteristic strength are relatively insensitive to the form of the underlying distribution, are recommended because their estimations are almost as good as those obtained when the form of the underlying distribution is known. These methods also have the practical advantage that testing can be stopped when all members of a sample have been loaded to a level so that about 10% have failed, leaving 90% undamaged.

AB - Due to lack of maintenance, increase in legal loads, and increased traffic volumes, several thousands of deficient bridges in the surface transportation system needed to be rehabilitated or replaced. One potential solution to several of today's bridge problems is the shell bridge. This system consists of integrated shell-deck concrete segments that are posttensioned together to form a bridge. A 1:3 shell-bridge model was fabricated and service-load tested to determine its behavior when subjected to various load patterns. The model was tested under the effect of single concentrated loads as well as simulated American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) HS20-44 truck loading. The model was analyzed using the ANSYS finite element program. The buckling potential due to the posttensioning forces was also investigated with ANSYS. Fabrication and construction of the 1:3 model verified the feasibility of constructing segmental shell bridges. The integrated shell-deck section exhibited high stiffness and yet is lighter than conventional systems.
