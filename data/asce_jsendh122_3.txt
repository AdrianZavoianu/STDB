AB - The influence of masonry infill panels on the seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) frames that were designed in accordance with current code provisions are investigated. Two types of frames are considered. One was designed for wind loads and the other for strong eqrthquake forces. Twelve 1/2-scale, single-story, single-bay, frame specimens were tested. The parameters investigated included the strength of infill panels with respect to that of the bounding frame, the panel aspect ratio, the distribution of vertical loads, and the lateral-load history. The experimental results indicate that infill panels can significantly improve the performance of RC frames. However, specimens with strong frames and strong panels exhibited a better performance than those with weak frames and weak panels in terms of the load resistance and energy-dissipation capability. The lateral loads developed by the infilled frame specimens were always higher than that of the bare frame. This is even true for the least ductile specimen deforming up to a drift level of 2%.

AB - Repairs to reinforced concrete beams suffering from chloride-induced corrosion necessitate breaking out concrete around reinforcement. Reinforcement and concrete cannot act compositely where bars are exposed, and the pattern of strains in a beam under load is altered. The present study evaluates postrepair structural performance of reinforced-concrete beams repaired when relieved of load and when repaired under load and using a variety of alternative approaches to maintain structural stability during repair operations. Two series of four or five beams each were loaded and subjected to simulated repair in the laboratory. A reference “as-new” beam was also tested in each series for comparison. The ultimate strength of beams repaired under load was not reduced in comparison with “as-new” companion specimens, although ductility, deflection, crack widths, and flexural stiffness were all affected. However, results do not suggest significant benefits in postrepair performance will be obtained through relieving a structure of load or from application of temporary longitudinal prestress while repairs are carried out. For beams repaired under load, two stage repairs (in which only half the reinforcement at a section is exposed at any one time) offered little overall improvement over single-stage repairs in which all bars were exposed simultaneously.

AB - To develop design guidelines for bond of glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) rebars to concrete, a total of 102 specimens were constructed and tested subjected to monotonic static loading. The research program was inclusive of the experimental testing of 48 beam specimens, 18 pull-out specimens, and 36 hooked rebar specimens. The tensile load was applied to the rebars in a gradual increment of load level until splitting of concrete, rebar pull-out failure, or rebar fracture occurred. The slip between the rebars and concrete was measured at the loaded and free ends at each load level. Variables included in the study were concrete compressive strength, embedment length, clear concrete cover, rebar diameter, concrete cast depth, radius of bend, and tail length. New criteria for acceptable bond performance of GFRP rebars to concrete were developed and were used to evaluate the experimental results. Design guidelines for calculating the development lengths for straight and hooked GFRP rebars to concrete were derived. In addition, confinement factors were calculated to reflect the influence of concrete cover and casting position.

AB - Analytical expressions for predicting the bond stress versus slip response and the bond stress distribution for different types of pullout tests were developed. These analytical studies were mainly based on the use of bond stress versus slip responses obtained by experimental results. The responses of both pullout failures and splitting failures were predicted. For both types of failure modes the results from pullout tests, push-in tests, and a combination of pullout and push-in tests were investigated. The analyses showed that in a standard pullout test the ratio of maximum to average bond stress is about 1.37 for a pullout failure and about 1.26 for a splitting failure. A suitable combination of pullout and push-in forces can simulate a nearly uniform bond stress distribution with ratios of maximum to average bond stress of 1.10 and 1.11 for pullout and splitting failures, respectively.

AB - This paper deals with the current state of the building code provisions for the structural design of concrete stair slabs in general and those proposed for the Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC) in particular. The design of stairs has not received due attention in most building codes. As a result, stairs, as they occur with a variety of support conditions, are designed based on the individual designer's judgment. This results in considerable overdesign with some particular types of support arrangements, since their behavior is not readily understood. The recently proposed draft of the Bangladesh National Building Code provides categorical recommendations for the design of different types of stair slabs. Some of these provisions have for the first time been included in a building code. The background of the design provisions as proposed in the BNBC is presented. A critical review of the relevant provisions of BNBC as well as the American, British, and Indian codes of practice are also highlighted in this paper.

AB - The theory of plasticity and the deformation compatibility equations are used to evaluate the development of lateral confinement of rectangular concrete columns and the resulting increases in strength and ductility. Concrete is modeled as an elastoplastic, strain hardening/softening material, with stress-path dependent strength and a nonassociative flow rule. The geometric modeling concentrates of the effects of the arrangement of transverse reinforcement on the type and magnitude of lateral confinement. The solution is based on the coupling of the elastoplastic relations for concrete and steel, and the compatibility of deformations of the concrete core and the transverse reinforcement. The ability of the method to predict the response of confined compression members is demonstrated based on several published experimental results.

AB - Research in the fundamental behavior of reinforced concrete has progressed greatly since the 1960s, particularly in the areas of shear and torsion. This large body of knowledge spawned many theories and created many terms that do not adhere to a centralized nomenclature—a very confusing situation for the engineering profession. This paper proposes a unified nomenclature that covers all four basic actions (bending, axial load, shear, and torsion) and is based on the angle of inclination of the concrete struts, the scope of applications, and the three fundamental principles of the mechanics of materials (stress equilibrium, strain compatibility, and the constitutive laws of materials). Six models are presented: strut-and-tie model, Bernoulli compatibility truss model, equilibrium (plasticity) truss model, Mohr compatibility truss model, softened truss model, and fixed-angle softened-truss model. This paper shows that all rational reinforced-concrete theories developed to date can be covered by these six models.

AB - The numerical errors obtained using various creep models and calculation procedures are compared in order to identify suitable creep models to use in the simulation of time-dependent behavior of concrete-framed structures subjected to variable sustained loads. A hereditary integral (memory) model and a nonhereditary (state) model were investigated using various formulations and alternative integration procedures. The alternative models are compared in terms of convergence, accuracy in relation to number of time steps, and the efficiency of the numerical integration methods. While the error in all of the formulations is seen to decrease with the number of time steps used, calculations that use the mean stress in each time interval give much more accurate results than those that use the stress at the commencement of the time step. Comparable accuracies are obtained from state and memory models, although numerical instabilities arise if linearization of the exponential functions in the state model is attempted.

AB - A method for the analysis of reinforced and prestressed concrete thin-walled open elements under combined loading is presented. The procedure is based on the Vlasov kinematic hypotheses for thin-walled open elements and uses the transfer matrix method to solve the problem that must be uncoupled in each portion of the element. Nonlinear behavior of reinforced and prestressed concrete under normal and tangential actions is taken into account. With a computer program based on this method, the experimental responses of eight prestressed concrete I-beams under mixed torsion, bending, and shear and the response of a reinforced concrete U-beam under mixed torsion are compared. The comparison of numerical and experimental results shows that the proposed method accurately represents the behavior of this type of element despite the simplifications introduced.

AB - Seismic isolation in the United States is gaining wide acceptance as an attractive and alternate means to upgrade historic structures seismically with minimal disturbance to architecturally significant features. One important historic-landmark structure that underwent such an upgrade is the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals building located in San Francisco, which suffered damage during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and was declared an unsafe building for further occupancy. The present paper summarizes the comprehensive approach adopted for implementation of the seismic-isolation technique for the seismic retrofit of this monumental structure. This historically significant structure is the first federal building to be retrofitted using seismic isolation. The paper discusses in detail the procedure adopted for evaluating the existing building strength, establishing the design approach, and evaluating and selecting the optimum isolator placement location and isolation system best suited for the building's structural performance and architectural usage.

AB - Structural steel angles have a wide variety of applications. However, steel angles have not received the attention comparable to heavy shapes such as wide flange sections. For steel angles, flexural buckling strength is the basic design strength, while the torsional-flexural buckling strength is computed in many codes by modifying the design procedure for flexural buckling strength. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of 26 hot-rolled steel angles under concentric axial compression failing in flexural buckling. The width-thickness ratios of test specimens ranged from 6 to 16. The slenderness ratios varied from 68 to 188, covering almost the entire practical range. Residual stresses and yield stresses across the cross sections were determined and initial out-of-straightness was measured. These data were used in the development of a column curve reported in a companion paper.

AB - Structural steel angles have a wide range of applications requiring a comprehensive design methodology. One of the most important aspects of steel-angle design is the flexural buckling strength. In this paper, the test data for flexural buckling reported in a companion paper as well as in published investigations are compared with current specifications, and the need for the development of a separate column curve for hot-rolled steel angles is established. The experimental data consist of 71 compression tests from five different studies and residual stress and out-of-straightness measurements. A finite-element analysis and a maximum strength analysis have been carried out using the available test data. Nine column curves have been generated. The average curve lies between the Structural Stability Research Council (SSRC) curves 1P and 2P. Equations for the curve have been presented. This column curve can be adopted for routine design or may be used to calibrate special code clauses.

AB - This paper describes a test program conducted on the behavior of cold-formed, compact square hollow section beam-columns. The tests were conducted in a purpose built test rig capable of applying load and moment in a constant ratio. The test specimens were pin-ended specimens loaded, with varying load/moment ratios, at two different ratios of end moment. The results of the tests were closely simulated using a finite-element program, thereby validating its use in predicting cold-formed tubular beam-column behavior. The finite-element program was then used to find the maximum load and moment capacity, for the section tested, at varying ratios of end moment, from which the corresponding maximum second-order elastic moments were calculated. The results of this numerical investigation are compared with the relevant interaction design rules from the 1990 Australian standard AS4100 and the 1986 American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) load and resistance factor design (LFRD) specification.

AB - The new generation of reliability-based load and resistance factor design (LRFD) method for the design of electric transmission line structures at member level is governed by  ASCE Manual 74
. Transmission towers generally comprise steel angle components. The nominal strength of these components, for various end conditions and slenderness ratios, is widely calculated using the design equations in  ASCE Manual 52
 for the reliability-based design (RBD). There are known inconsistencies in the RBD of tower members using these  ASCE Manuals
, particularly in the case of members in compression. Considering these facts, the effect of buckling, joint connections, and framing eccentricities on the RBD of components have been examined and limiting values of the slenderness ratio ( L
/r) for the compression member alone are proposed in this technical note. A 220-kV tangent tower has been used for full-scale testing to validate the analytical results, and a good agreement with the predicted results indicates a definite need for an improvement of  ASCE Manual 52
 and the relevant Indian standards.
