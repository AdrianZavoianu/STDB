AB - This study concerns a type of local failure that was observed during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake: a brace-to-beam connection in concentric braced frame structures due to lack of adequate lateral support to both flanges of the beam. Experimental and analytical studies were carried out to investigate the failure. Field observed local failure of the brace-to-beam connection was reproduced in the laboratory test specimen. The hysteretic loops of the locally failed specimen showed excessive “pinching” when compared to those of bracing members with adequate lateral support. Local failure was confirmed by a finite element analysis. Several upgrading schemes were evaluated by the finite element analyses. The analyses showed that the specimen with a diagonal stiffener in the beam web along the centerline of the brace member axis performed best. The effectiveness of diagonal web stiffeners was verified experimentally.

AB - Results of stationary and transient response analyses of the       Golden Gate suspension bridge, and the New River Gorge and Cold Spring Canyon deck arch bridges, to a general spatially varying earthquake ground motion (SVEGM) model are presented. The results are compared with responses computed using identical and delayed excitations. The use of identical excitations is in general unacceptable for these long-span bridges, and the use of delayed excitations is acceptable only for the longitudinal response of short arch bridges. Surprisingly, the transient lateral displacements of the suspension bridge center span significantly overshoot the corresponding stationary displacements for the filtered Kanai-Tajami excitation power spectrum; this spectrum may therefore be unsuitable for analyzing very flexible structures. The qualitative effects of SVEGM on stationary and transient force responses are found to be similar.

AB - The recorded response of a base-isolated structure excited by the 1994 Northridge earthquake is utilized to validate existing computational methodologies. The isolated structure is located at 1955 1/2 Purdue Avenue in Los Angeles, Calif., and is a three-story braced-steel-frame residential building supported on helical steel springs and viscoelastic-fluid dampers. The procedure developed during the construction of the building by one of the writers to model the isolation system using generalized-derivative constitutive models is utilized to predict the response of the structure. The predicted response is in good agreement with recorded data at the first and third floors of the base-isolated building. Subsequently, it is shown that the peak values of the response can be satisfactorily predicted using an approximate procedure based on modal analysis. The importance of the isolation system is discussed.

AB - Code torsional provisions primarily aim to limit the additional response of lateral load-resisting elements arising from plan eccentricity. Intensive research has addressed this issue exclusively by evaluating additional ductility and deformation demands in plan-eccentric or torsionally unbalanced (TU) structural systems, and comparing the results with well-established seismic design criteria. This paper adopts an alternative approach toward providing complementary data for code evaluation by first analyzing the distribution of hysteretic energy dissipated by the inelastic response of the various lateral restraining elements, and assessing the influence of various seismic code torsional provisions on this energy absorption distribution. Second, in order to evaluate the adequacy of code torsional provisions in restricting inelastic damage effects in TU systems, an energy dissipation index based on the equivalent hysteretic ductility is proposed. This index provides a first step in the development of a widely applicable inelastic damage index for such systems. It is concluded that the distribution of seismic energy dissipation demand on the critical edge elements is greatly influenced by the dynamic torsional response arising due to asymmetry, and also by the form of codified torsional provisions. The flexible-edge element in systems designed according to the  Uniform Building Code (UBC) and the New Zealand code may incur considerable additional inelastic (hysteretic) energy dissipation demand, compared with the equivalent torsionally balanced (TB) systems. For the stiff-edge element, the New Zealand and European code provisions, which permit large reductions of element strength, may induce exceptionally large hysteretic energy dissipation demand and, hence, this element is potentially more vulnerable to seismic damage. Conversely, the UBC provision, which permits no strength reduction in the stiff-edge element may be overly conservative, with very small amounts of hysteretic energy being dissipated. These conclusions are in close agreement with the results of previous studies by the writers and other researchers, which utilized the peak element ductility and deformation demands as measures of dynamic inelastic torsional effects in plan-asymmetric buildings.

AB - Recent analytical studies have shown that reduced column compression and even tension may be experienced by intermediate stories of medium to high-rise reinforced concrete (RC) structures. This is a consequence of high overturning moments coexisting with vertical ground motion. In recognition of such observations, the present study was initiated to investigate the seismic performance of interior beam-column subassemblages under reduced column compression or net tension. A state-of-the-art synchronized shake-table facility was used to test a total of six ordinary and marginal high-strength RC interior subassemblages. A nonconventional design approach was adopted to ensure pure panel-zone (PZ) shear failure, hence a realistic estimate of joint shear strength will ensue. Results indicated loss of shear capacity and increase in deformability when compression column load is markedly reduced or tension is experienced. Findings of this investigation are most useful in providing necessary information about the effect of axial tension on the PZ shear capacity, the joint confinement efficiency, and the overall structural stability in areas of potential high vertical earthquake excitations.

AB - In this paper, a conception of load-induced stiffness matrix is developed, and a beam element for using the finite-element method, which takes into consideration the stiffening effect of dead loads, is proposed. The element stiffness matrices including the effect of dead loads are derived according to Hamilton's principle. The effect of dead loads on natural frequencies is analyzed by the finite-element method for simply supported and cantilever beams; and two types of dead load, uniform load per unit length and concentrated load, are considered in calculations. It is shown that the natural frequencies increase when the effect of dead loads is included, and that the effect is more significant for cantilever beams than for simply supported beams. The validity of the proposed procedure is confirmed by the numerical examples. Although the results obtained by the finite-element method are in agreement with those given by Takabatake, the proposed method with a finite-element-method formulation is more easily applied to practical structures under various support conditions and various types of dead loads.

AB - The modal analysis procedure for calculating the dynamic response of classically damped linear structural systems is reformulated with the objective of developing the physical significance of the elements of the solution and defining modal contribution factors. The resulting concepts are used to develop an approach for predicting how the relative contributions of various modes to the response and the number of modes that should be included in the solution depend on the vibration properties of the system, on the response quantity of interest, and on (1) the spatial distribution and time variation of applied dynamic forces in the case of force-excited systems, or (2) the response (or design) spectrum for an earthquake excitation. To illustrate this approach, numerical results are presented for a five-story frame for a wide range of parameters and a base-isolated building.

AB - The dynamic response of Morrow Point Dam to Taft ground motion is presented for a wide range of properties of the dam, foundation rock, impounded water, and reservoir boundary materials. Based on these response results, the effects of dam-foundation rock interaction (considering damping, inertia, and flexibility of the foundation rock) with empty reservoir are investigated. The significance of dam-foundation rock interaction effects ignored in standard analyses that consider flexibility of the foundation rock but not its inertia or damping—material and radiation—effects is then identified. Finally, the combined effects of dam-foundation rock interaction, dam-water interaction, and reservoir boundary absorption are studied.

AB - We seek to ascertain whether the reverse Weibull distribution is an appropriate extreme wind-speed model by performing statistical analyses based on the “peaks over threshold” approach. We use the de Haan method, which was found in previous studies to perform about as well or better than the Pickands and cumulative mean exceedance methods, and has the advantage of providing estimates of confidence bounds. The data are taken principally from records of the largest daily wind speeds obtained over periods of 15 to 26 years at 44 U.S. weather stations in areas not subjected to mature hurricane winds. From these records we create samples with reduced mutual correlation among the data. In our opinion, the analyses provide persuasive evidence that extreme wind speeds are described predominantly by reverse Weibull distributions, which unlike the Gumbel distribution have a finite upper tail and lead to reasonable estimates of wind load factors. Instructions are provided for accessing the data and attendant programs.

AB - Loads such as those caused by wind, snow, and dead weight act along members in a frame structure. This type of member loads is extremely common in the practical design and analysis of structures. However, most research studies on the second-order and nonlinear analysis of frames idealize all loads as nodal forces and moments. Unlike in a linear analysis, the stress due to the nodal moments and forces in a second-order analysis cannot be simply superimposed on the stress created by the loads along members to obtain the final bending moment and force diagrams, because they affect the nonlinear element stiffness. Without careful consideration of the interactive and nonlinear response of the element with member and nodal loads, the accuracy of a nonlinear analysis for realistic problems is questionable. This paper presents the formulation of a proficient element for the second-order analysis of frames accounting for the nonlinear interaction between the element stiffness, the nodal load, and the member load. The degree of accuracy satisfies the requirement for practical applications, while the simplicity allows the approach to be easily coded in a computer program for the practical analysis of steel frames.

AB - A method for structural parameter identification utilizing elemental strain measurements is presented. By using a subset of applied static forces and a subset of measured strains, element stiffness parameters of all or a portion of a finite element model of the structure are identified. This method preserves the structural connectivity and determines changes in cross-sectional properties at the element level, including large changes or element failures for stable structures. Strain measurements do not require a frame of reference; this makes them superior to static displacement measurements. Strain measurements are also more accurate than ordinary displacement measurements and can easily be used on bridges, buildings, and space structures. The identified cross-sectional element properties can be used for damage assessment and load rating of structures. Two numerical examples, including two-dimensional (2D) truss and frame structures, are presented and the element stiffnesses are successfully and accurately evaluated.

AB - A method for the parameter estimation of structures was developed in a companion paper. It used subsets of static applied forces and strain measurements and successfully identified structural element stiffnesses. In the presence of noisy measurements, the selection of these subsets drastically affect the accuracy of the parameter estimates. In addition, there are a large number of combinations of applied force and strain measurements to be considered. Therefore, a heuristic method is presented for choosing a small subset of forces and strain measurements so as to have the least sensitivity to measurement noise. Once chosen, using a Monte Carlo analysis the subset of measurements is analyzed to determine an input-output error relationship. This heuristic method can be used to design near-optimal experiments for the nondestructive testing and parameter estimation of structures. A truss and a frame example are presented and a small and noise-tolerant subset of forces and strains is successfully selected for possible nondestructive testing.

AB - The present study is aimed at developing a rational design formula for predicting the ultimate strength of steel outstands in compression. To this end, an extensive elastoplastic large displacement finite-element  method (FEM) analysis is conducted. The outstand is assumed to have initial out-of-flatness as well as residual stresses. Based on the numerical results, a formula is derived as a function of both magnitude of the initial out-of-flatness and residual stress. The formula is then used to predict the ultimate compressive strength of members with H-sections, and comparisons of the predicted ultimate strengths given by the effective width method are made with those of numerical study and tests. It is found that the proposed formula can be used in the prediction of the ultimate strengths of compression members that have steel outstands.
