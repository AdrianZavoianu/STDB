AB - Steel moment resisting frames were highly regarded for seismic resistant design. This opinion was based on early research and observations of their performance in past earthquakes. Its reputation was tarnished during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, because cracking was noted in many steel frame buildings. Widely divergent opinions have been expressed regarding the causes of this cracking. The present paper examines the results of past experiments to provide a rational evaluation of potential causes of the observed damage. More than 120 experiments are reviewed, and 91 are examined in detail. Comparisons across different test programs and statistical analyses are performed. The results show that flexural ductility of the beam is reduced by shear yielding in the panel zone and increased beam depth. Beam-flange thickness, column orientation, and beam span to depth ratio also influence the flexural ductility. Other factors including welding process, the size and type of weld, and the yield stress and tensile strength of the steel are briefly examined. The implications of these observations to engineering practice are summarized.

AB - A one-story, one-bay steel structure was constructed such that the beam-column connections could be changed from flexible to semirigid to rigid. Using a shaking table, structures with these three types of connections were subjected to base excitations with various intensities of records obtained from several past earthquakes. These studies indicated that the semirigidity of steel frames does not necessarily result in larger lateral drifts or in more damage than in the rigid frames. It was also observed that a well-proportioned semirigid connection designed to behave in a ductile manner can effectively participate in the nonlinear behavior of the structure, thus providing additional global structural ductility.

AB - Studied in this paper is the inelastic seismic behavior and design of asymmetric multistory buildings emphasizing, primarily, the use of story shear and torque histories. The following six different structural characteristics and their effect on the torsional response of buildings are analyzed: strength of orthogonal resisting planes, stiffness asymmetry, strength asymmetry, planwise distribution of strength, number of resisting planes, and intensity of the ground motion component in the orthogonal direction. As a result of these analyses several techniques and conceptual guidelines are developed to correct the planwise unbalance in deformation demands typical of asymmetric structures. The two most important are to increase the torsional capacity of the system by introducing resisting planes in the orthogonal direction, and to modify the stiffness and strength distribution to localize yielding in selected resisting planes. Using these guidelines the undesirable earthquake response of a very asymmetrical building is effectively corrected by changing slightly the strength of a few key resisting planes. Finally, it is concluded that the use of the story shear and response histories in conjunction with the corresponding story yield surfaces is a powerful tool for conceptual understanding of the earthquake behavior of asymmetric structures.

AB - This paper studies the seismic response of structure-elevator systems. Dynamic models are developed to represent the structure and elevator counterweight subsystems, with nonlinear contact elements between the counterweight and the guide rails. The computational output is given in terms of maximum rail stresses, relative elastic deflections, and interaction forces between counterweight and guide rails. Numerical methods are developed and analysis is performed to study the seismic response of the combined system. The structure subsystem is represented by six flexural modes (i.e., three for each of two horizontal axes), while the counterweight subsystem is modeled with four degrees of freedom. A nonlinear contact element with air gaps, viscous damper, Coulomb friction, and variable stiffness of guide rail is developed to model the dynamic interaction between structure and counterweight subsystems. Nonlinear time-history dynamic analysis was carried out using step-by-step integration of the 20 first-order differential equations using the Runge-Kutta fifth-order method. It was observed that contact forces and rail stresses depend on the mass of the counterweight, width of gaps, cross-sectional properties of rails, vertical motion velocity, and intensities of earthquake excitations. Dynamic contact between the counterweight and guide rails introduces large forces that may endanger the elevator system.

AB - The problem in this paper is to find the set of story stiffnesses of an elastic shear building with added viscous dampers such that each mean maximum interstory drift due to spectrum-compatible design earthquakes would coincide with the specified value. Two simple stiffness formulas have been derived by means of the proposed inverse perturbation procedure of damping level, referred to as the “inverse damping perturbation.” The first formula enables one to evaluate the primary effect of heavy damping for stiffness design, and the second formula enables one to evaluate the effect of off-diagonal terms of the modal damping matrix that is neglected in the first formula. A storywise criterion is derived by use of the second formula as to whether the effect can be negligible or not.

AB - Bridge piers with hollow box sections are widely used in Japan in highway bridges. Unlike the columns in buildings, these piers are designed with high width-thickness ratios of component plates. This makes them susceptible to damage during a severe seismic event. To evaluate the damage sustained, a damage model is developed based on cyclic loading tests on hollow box columns modeling bridge piers. The box columns were tested under a constant axial load and cyclic lateral loads. It was found that the degree and type of damage sustained depends on parameters of the structure and the loading history. The overall behavior is assessed by means of a damage model that accounts for these effects. The parametric constants of the damage model are evaluated using test results. Since the residual strength is an important physical measure of the damage sustained, approximate expressions for correlating the residual strength and the damage index are suggested. The damage model developed in this paper is intended to be used to quantify the damage sustained under earthquake loading.

AB - The seismic response of steel box columns modeling bridge piers is studied using the pseudodynamic testing method. The concept of the pseudodynamic test is reviewed. Scaled models of steel bridge piers of box section were tested under a constant axial load and using site-specific spectrum-compatible accelerograms. The columns sustained damage in the form of local buckling, due to large deformations and low-cycle fatigue. The overall damage sustained was quantified by means of a damage index developed from theoretical considerations and cyclic loading tests. The damage index is meant to assess the safety against collapse and does not consider the serviceability requirements. Tests showed that the damage sustained depends on the structural parameters, axial load, and the parameters of the ground motion. In view of such complications the damage index seems to describe adequately the overall damage sustained under seismic loading with a minimum of computational effort.

AB - Results of an experimental and theoretical investigation on the dynamic characteristics of post-tensioned concrete girders with web openings subjected to repeated cyclic loading are presented. Rectangular, T and I cross-sectional girders were fabricated and tested. Each cross-sectional group included a girder with none, one, and two openings centered about the midspan for a total of nine test girders. Experimental testing included static, dynamic, fatigue, and ultimate loading of each girder. Fatigue loadings of up to 10,000,000 cycles were applied. The finite element method was used to determine the dynamic characteristics of the tested girders and to conduct an extensive parametric study. It is shown that repeated cyclic loading leads to significant cracking at the openings' corners and a deterioration in the dynamic characteristics of such structural members. In addition, the natural frequencies are significantly influenced by the shape of the prestressing strands and magnitude of the prestress force level.

AB - The vibration method is usually used for field measurement of cable tension during the construction of cable system bridges such as an arch bridge stiffened with inclined cables or a cable-stayed bridge. Practical formulas for the vibration method are proposed herein taking the effects of flexural rigidity and sag of a cable into account. The formulas are based on the approximate solutions of high accuracy for the equation of inclined cable with flexural rigidity. Cable tensions are easily estimated by these formulas using measured natural frequencies of low-order modes. The practical formulas presented herein are applicable to various cables, regardless of length and tension as far as the vibration of firstor second-order mode is measurable. As to a very long cable that cannot be easily excited artificially, a formula is presented by using natural frequencies of high-order modes obtained from stationary microvibrations. The accuracy is confirmed through comparison of the values obtained by practical formulas with measured values and calculated values by the finite element method.

AB - The differential quadrature method (DQM) is applied to computation of the eigenvalues of small-amplitude free vibration for horizontally curved beams including a warping contribution. Natural frequencies are calculated for single-span, curved, wide-flange uniform beams having a range of nondimensional parameters representing variations in warping stiffness, torsional stiffness, radius of curvature, included angle of the curve, polar mass moment of inertia, and various end conditions. Results are compared with existing exact and numerical solutions by other methods for cases in which they are available. The DQM provides accuracy even when only a limited number of grid points is used. In addition, results are given for a cantilever that has one clamped end and one free end; no previous results are known for this case. Finally, parametric results are presented in dimensionless form.

AB - A digitally controlled monitoring system has been installed to observe and control the propagation of cracks in the Dome of Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Firenze, Italy. This system has been in operation since 1988. This paper describes the Brunelleschi Dome structure, the development of cracks, and the monitoring system. The monitoring of data is evaluated based with an understanding of the structural behavior of the Dome. Presently the behavior is very different than it was earlier because of the presence of the cracks themselves. The correlation between crack width variation and environmental loads is analyzed. A numerical procedure was developed to estimate the trend of the increasing crack mean width. The results are compared to those obtained by the analysis of other monitoring systems previously installed in the Dome and historical data. Some considerations and suggestions about the use of monitoring systems in the field of the structural preservation of historic buildings are also discussed.

AB - An approximate method to predict ultimate strength is presented for orthogonally stiffened steel plates subjected to uniaxial compression, based on the orthotropic plate theory. The present method can treat all collapse modes which occur on the orthogonally stiffened plates; for example, overall buckling of the main plate together with longitudinal and transverse stiffeners, and overall buckling of the main plate between the adjacent transverse stiffeners together with longitudinal stiffeners. In addition, the method includes the effect of the local buckling that occurs on the longitudinal stiffeners and/or the plate panels bounded by both the longitudinal and transverse stiffeners. Thus the method can be used for the practical design of actual steel stiffened plates; i.e., subjected to eccentric compression, nonuniformly stiffened, or having large stringers together with longitudinal stiffeners. Many test results of longitudinally and orthogonally stiffened steel plates subjected to uniaxial compression are used for comparing with the ultimate strength predicted by the present method. It is found from comparison that the present method shows a good agreement with the test results.

The nonlinear behavior of the masonry in compression due to progressive cracking, and geometric and material nonlinearities is considered in the model. Details of the elastoplastic constitutive model and failure criteria for both blocks and mortar joints are presented. Results from a simulated test of a three-block-high prism are given in the form of stress, strain, and displacement plots. The behavior of the model is compared to known experimental behavior. The methodology, when combined with the substructuring technique, will allow analysis of substantially larger walls than would the more typical full three-dimensional (3D) analysis.

AB - A procedure is presented for the analysis of the stability and propagation of cracks in arch dams based on linear elastic fracture mechanics and three-dimensional boundary element modeling. A simplified crack propagation criterion is employed and the crack trajectories are obtained by multistep extension. The first upstream cracking which occurred in the Kölnbrein arch dam is studied in detail under various conditions concerning the foundation interface, location of crack initiation, reservoir water level and load combinations. Crack trajectories close to the observed one are obtained with water level at 1,850–1,860 m, which agrees with the prototype experience. It is found that the hydrostatic load and associated uplift pressure on the crack surfaces are the key factors for causing an initial crack at the dam base to propagate to the upstream face. It is also noted that the bonded condition at the interface between the dam and the upstream elevated foundation is responsible for producing the distinctive profile of the observed crack, which daylights on the upstream face at an acute angle.

Random fields are represented as continuous functions by using general orthogonal series expansions, and are incorporated directly into the nonlinear finite element analysis and first-order reliability formulation. The proposed method is illustrated by two examples involving a fixed-end beam and a frame. Random spatial fluctuations in the material properties or distributed loads may have a significant effect on reliability if correlation lengths of random fields are less than the lengths of members, meaning that local fluctuations in the fields are relatively high.
