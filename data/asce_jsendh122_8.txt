AB - Although space trusses have been in continuous development since the 1950s, their share in the market of large-span structures is still quite small. Because of being costlier than one-way beam and framed structural alternatives, the use of space trusses has almost been restricted to applications where the trusses' pleasing appearance can justify their high cost. Attempts to address the cost concern of space trusses have resulted in truss systems that do not need node connectors for their assembly, but use continuous chord members directly joined together and with the diagonal members. This technique resulted in a considerable cost cut and was responsible for the relative success of these systems in the economic market. This paper presents a space truss system newly developed with the main objective of achieving a larger reduction in the overall cost of space trusses without compromise in the structural reliability or the common ease of construction. To achieve this goal, the new truss has a simple jointing system that requires no expensive node connectors, and a simple member splicing system that has almost no adverse effect on the truss's performance. The paper includes an introduction to the system's features and an experimental assessment of the claim that the new jointing system of the truss does not entail any compromise in its structural efficiency or reliability.

AB - Cold-formed steel C-sections are frequently used as wall studs and floor joists in both commercial and residential construction. To facilitate installation of ancillary systems such as electrical wiring and plumbing, the C-section is manufactured with a web opening. Although the opening offers construction advantages, it may degrade the structural integrity of the member. To quantify the degrading effect of a web opening, a study has been conducted at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR). The UMR study included the loading conditions of bending, shear, web crippling, and the combinations thereof. This paper summarizes the results of an experimental study which addressed the behavior of combined bending and shear. A total of 68 beam specimens, with varying magnitudes of bending moment and shear force were tested. Based on the findings of this study, it was concluded that the interaction equation employed by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) specification will provide an adequate strength prediction, provided that the shear and bending capacities are modified to account for the influence of the web opening.

AB - Tests are described in which 12 castellated beams were loaded to failure in order to study the buckling of the web post between openings. In 10 cases web-post buckling occurred. Finite-element analysis (FEM) of the web post, taking into account inelastic action, was used to predict the buckling loads. Also, graphical results were obtained based on a previously described analysis in which the web post was treated as a beam and the finite difference method was used to obtain the buckling loads. Both methods show very good correlation with the maximum test loads. Either of these methods provide a satisfactory basis for design, although the FEM results are superior because of the lower variability in the predictions. The graphical results provide general solutions covering a practical range of geometries, and can be considered suitable until the results of finite-element parameter studies become available.

AB - An experimental research program on nailed steel tubular connections is described. The “nailing” of one tube to another coaxial tube within it is achieved by a powder-actuated tool and very high strength driven pins (or nails). Combined steel thicknesses of up to 13 mm (1/2 in.) have been easily connected. Furthermore, these structural connections are made very quickly and safely after minimal training with the equipment. A range of tubes up to 406 mm (16 in.) in diameter, with various diameter-to-thickness ratios, tube wall thickness, and lack of fit, have been joined and 42 tube connections have been tested to failure under axial tension or compression loading. The observed failure modes were nail shear failure, tube bearing failure, and tube shear out failure, for which simple prediction formulas are verified. A recommended load and resistance factor design (or limit states design) procedure for such axially loaded tube-in-tube connections is then advocated.

AB - A parametric study of the static strength of circular hollow-section joints with the multiplanar KK configuration, commonly found in both onshore and offshore structures, is presented. The study, carried out using a well-calibrated and validated finite-element model, investigated the effects of the various geometric parameters on static strength. Particular attention was given to joints with γ ratios, where the amount of experimental data is scarce, to the effect of γ on strength, and to the influence of the two major failure modes. In all, a total of 50 joints were analyzed. The study has established a clear demarcation boundary between the two failure types as a function of the transverse gap between the braces. A strength database—compiled from the finite-element data generated and 37 existing test results—was used to formulate strength equations through multiple regression analyses. The equations were found to provide strength predictions to a very high degree of accuracy.

AB - This paper presents a new formulation for the large-displacement analysis of thin-walled frames taking into account the effects of elastoplastic material behavior. The proposed formulation is derived in an Eulerian (convected) local system which allows relatively simple strain-displacement relationships to be used. Furthermore, the formulation uses the fiber approach for representing the spread of plasticity over a general open cross section, and is capable of modeling initial imperfections, residual stresses, and the Wagner effect. In accounting for material plasticity effects, consideration is given to the interaction between normal stresses and shear stresses due to twisting. Since the shear strain is directly related to the rate of twist, the shear stress in the yield function is replaced by an equivalent contribution to the cross-sectional torque, which leads to considerable computational advantages. This paper describes the formulation details and the implementation of material plasticity effects for kinematic and isotropic strain hardening, whereas the companion paper provides a number of verification and application examples.

AB - The companion paper presents a new Eulerian formulation for the large-displacement analysis of thin-walled frames, accounting for the elastoplastic material response. This paper aims at verifying the proposed formulation and providing several examples of its application to thin-walled members and frames. In this regard, it is demonstrated that such a relatively simple formulation enables the accurate modeling of initial imperfections, residual stresses, the Wagner effect, the beam-column effect, lateral-torsional instability, and large displacements using a small number of elements and a coarse cross-sectional discretization. Moreover, it is shown that the formulation can be used in the assessment of the ultimate and postultimate response of thin-walled structures for which the design codes are either inaccurate or inapplicable. Such structures include continuous beams, simply supported beams with intermediate lateral restraints, as well as frames for which the ultimate limit state involves considerable interaction between the structural members.

AB - A methodology based on inelastic finite-element modeling is employed to evaluate analytically the stiffness and strength characteristics of steel bolted end-plate connections. ANSYS, version 4.4, a large-scale general-purpose finite-element code, is selected for three-dimensional analysis. All major elements influencing the overall response of such connections, including column, beam, bolt components, material plasticity, strain hardening, and interaction of end-plate and column flange through their contact regions, are considered in this framework. The connections are loaded under pure bending moment and the analysis is restricted to internal symmetric, two-way connections. The overall moment-rotation behavior, both for hand-tight and prestressed initial conditions, is discussed and compared against experimental data. The patterns of deformation, stress, and prying force are illustrated using stereoscopic graphs. They are considered as valuable tools for designers to interpret the mechanism(s) through which a connection responds to applied load.

AB - Two analytical approaches are used to investigate the effect of curvature on the elastic local buckling behavior of horizontally curved I-girder compression flanges. First, a governing differential equation for the isolated curved flange plate elements under various loading and boundary conditions is derived in polar coordinates and the equation is solved using the finite-difference technique. Numerical results for various curvatures and aspect ratios are generated. Second, the finite-element method using MSC/NASTRAN is used where the entire cross section of the curved I-girder is modeled. A comparison of the results from the two approaches is made and differences are explained. The effect of curvature on the elastic buckling of the flange plates is observed and a simple but conservative formulation representing this effect is derived for design use.

AB - A procedure for the design of a second-order dynamic controller is presented. The proposed method is applied to the control of structures under earthquake and wind excitations. The controller gains are determined by minimizing the root-mean-square value of the response parameter of interest for the structure, assuming that the excitation is Gaussian white noise. Three examples of structures (of which two are assumed to be subjected to the N-S component of the 1940 El Centro earthquake and one is assumed to be excited by wind loads) are considered to illustrate the design technique. In the first of the earthquake engineering applications, the controller is used for active base isolation of a building modeled as a shear frame, while in the second, it is used to develop an active mass damper for a three-dimensional building with eccentric axes of inertia and rotation (and consequently coupled longitudinal, lateral, and torsional motions). The wind engineering application is the design of an active mass damper for a high-rise building modeled as a planar frame subjected to wind loads. Numerical results for the examples reveal that the actively controlled base-isolation system with velocity feedback has better performance than that with either acceleration or displacement feedback. Complete feedback (i.e., feedback using position, velocity, and acceleration) was used for the active mass damper designs, and the controller was seen to be quite effective in reducing displacement and acceleration levels for both the three-dimensional building (with various eccentric locations of the axes of rotation and inertia) and for the planar frame. For all examples studied the active control systems were observed to perform better than their passive counterparts. Comments on the performance and control effectiveness of these designs and closed-loop-system behavior are made.

AB - A C-core sandwich panel consists of two facing plates connected top and bottom to a core of C-shaped stiffeners. Sandwich panels of this type have high bending and shear-stiffness characteristic in the direction of the core. In the transverse direction, however, both stiffness properties are relatively weak, in particular the shear stiffness. In this paper, the shear stiffness in the weaker direction for C-core sandwich panels is derived and studied. Due to the geometry and discontinuity of the core configuration, the shear stiffness in the weaker direction must be derived from the first principle. By assuming the recurrence condition, the writers previously derived an approximate expression for the shear stiffness in the weaker direction. The work described here presents a more accurate formulation, taking into account the contact interaction between the facing plates and the flanges of the C-core stiffeners. The compatibility equations are obtained from Castigliano's second theorem. The shear strain of a typical segment is obtained from the principle of virtual work. Explicit formulation for the shear-stiffness property is given in this paper. The accuracy of the derivation is verified using thick-plate analysis. A detailed comparison with finite-element studies and experimental results is also given. Good agreement is obtained between the theoretical predictions as derived and experimental results.

AB - Cold-formed steel Z-purlins were tested in combining bending and shear to evaluate the behavior of lap joints. The tested sections covered a range of web depth-to-thickness ratios ( h
/t) from 79 to 131 and lap-to-span ratios from 0.25 to 1.0. The results indicated that the lapping process significantly enhances the load capacity for beams with lap-to-span ratios up to 0.5. Little or no further enhancement was noted for higher ratios. A bending buckling pattern governed the failure of all beams at stresses close to the steel yield stress. Failure was encountered in the single-section zone for beams with lap-to-span ratio less than 0.5, and in the lap zone for higher ratios. Correlations were established to predict the load capacity of lapped beams and were found in agreement with the results of a study cited in the literature. Current American Iron and Steel Institute specifications were also found to be adequate to predict the strength of the single Z-section.

AB - Various equivalent linear analysis methods for base-isolated regular bridges are compared and evaluated in this paper. The equivalent linear analysis models encompassed in the paper are those specified by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Japanese Public Works Research Institute (JPWRI). In addition, an internally used model by the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) and a recently proposed model are also included. The comparison and evaluation are conducted to investigate the fidelity of various equivalent linear models in simulating the bilinear hysteretic bearings and the accuracy of the models in predicting the maximum seismic responses of the bearings. To perform the evaluation, a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system composed of a rigid block isolated by bilinear hysteretic bearings is subjected to 55 earthquake ground motions. The discrepancies of maximum seismic responses predicted by equivalent linear analysis methods and by inelastic analysis method are measured using root mean square (RMS) errors. The average of RMS errors over the 55 earthquake ground motions are compared and used to evaluate the formulations of equivalent linear analysis methods.
