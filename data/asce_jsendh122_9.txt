AB - The feasibility of using welded wire fabric in concrete bridge slabs was investigated by testing 15 slabs up to their ultimate capacity. The experimental and analytical studies showed that simply supported slabs reinforced with welded wire fabric are less ductile than slabs reinforced with conventional reinforcing steel. However, slabs with partial or fixed supports have a comparable load-deflection behavior when reinforced with either type of reinforcement. The load-deflection curves were predicted by using the finite element method and an analytical method which uses the strain compatibility concepts. The experimental measurements showed that the analytical results were accurate up to the point when the concrete begins to crush. It was concluded that the reinforcement ratio, transverse wire orientation, and boundary conditions are the major factors that affect the behavior of concrete slabs reinforced with welded wire fabric.

AB - This paper presents part of an investigation on the failure modes in reinforced concrete bridge decks subjected to monotonic static concentrated wheel-loads. The punching shear deck failure appears to be interrelated with a snap-through instability of an “arching” action mechanism activated in the deck. The predicted critical deflection of about 25% of the deck thickness at instability of a two-dimensional laterally restrained three-hinge compressive strut mechanism correlates well with the measured static ultimate deck deflection values of bridge decks that failed primarily in punching. There is also good agreement between the predicted critical applied static concentrated load at instability of the proposed three-hinge truss and the experimental static deck ultimate strength values.

AB - Orthogonally reinforced panels subjected to in-plane shear and normal loads in certain cases fail by a mode called concrete shear failure, because of a considerable sliding which occurs between the faces of the ultimate critical crack. This mode is observed when the transverse reinforcement is considerably less than the longitudinal reinforcement. In this case failure occurs after yielding of the transverse reinforcement, but prior to yielding of the longitudinal reinforcement. An analytical study of this mode of failure is presented. It has been shown that the so-called concrete shear failure is in fact due to neither shear nor compression of concrete, but due to a tension caused by splitting of concrete. It is further shown that splitting results in a sliding of the ultimate critical crack faces. The theoretical results of this analysis are compared with existing experimental data on panels of reinforced concrete, which were tested under various shear and normal in-plane loads. The test panels were constructed of normal as well as high-strength concrete. For both qualities of concrete, the theoretical and experimental results are found  to be  in excellent agreement.

AB - Chemically bonded postinstalled anchors have seen tremendous growth over the past few years for retrofits, as well as new construction. Currently, they are designed from proprietary tables provided by adhesive manufacturers based on laboratory pullout tests. Recently, Doerr et al. (1989), Cook (1993), and Eligehausen et al. (1984) have developed equations to predict pullout resistance of anchors. Since chemically bonded anchors result in the failure of both the concrete and adhesive-concrete interface, the equations attempt to predict the ultimate resistance of the anchor through the sum of the contributions from the concrete-failure cone and adhesive-concrete interface. However, this approach requires an estimate of both the average or maximum shear stress within the adhesive bond layer and the concrete-failure cone depths. To shed more light on the development of failure for these types of anchors, a state-of-the art elastoplastic finite-element analysis was performed and compared to experimental results. Besides being able to predict pullout resistance, concrete-failure cone depths, and orientations, the analysis revealed that failure initiates as a tension zone below the concrete surface at the anchor-adhesive interface and propagates with load toward the surface. In the process, both the concrete and adhesive material dilate increasing the confinement and shear resistance within the adhesive layer. Once the tension zone reaches the surface, the confinement is lost, resulting in a diminished shear resistance within the adhesive layer and anchor failure. After comparing a number of proposed methods to predict resistance to the experimental data, it was found that a simplistic, uniform bond stress applied over the whole anchor did an excellent job of predicting pullout capacity.

AB - A simple procedure for calculating deflections of reinforced concrete two-way slabs is presented in this paper. The material model for reinforced concrete based on the effective stiffness approach has been implemented in a finite-element program incorporating Mindlin-plate–bending elements. Uncracked concrete is treated as an isotropic linear elastic material, and after cracking, the concrete is considered to be an orthotropic material. The reduced stiffness coefficients after cracking are calculated from the effective moments of inertia in the  x
- and  y
-directions. These effective moments of inertia are determined using the formula proposed by Branson (1963). The influence of both bending and torsional moments is included in the formulation. The proposed model has been verified by comparisons with results from tests on slabs with various loading and boundary conditions. A study has also been undertaken to check the sensitivity of the proposed formulation when applied to the analysis of slabs with different reinforcement ratios, boundary conditions, and reinforcement orientations.

AB - Results of three-dimensional (3D) finite-element failure analysis of composite masonry walls subjected to both vertical and horizontal loads are presented in this paper. The wall is modeled by using eight-noded solid elements and cracking at the interfaces is defined by a simple Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The smeared crack technique is used to model the cracks. It is shown that cracking in the collar joint is initiated at a much smaller magnitude of the horizontal inplane load compard to the vertical load. This phenomenon may be attributed to the relatively high rigidity of the wall in the vertical direction. The failure loads for composite walls are computed using the 3D analysis and are compared with those obtained from an approximate method and experimental values. It is shown that the computed failure loads follow the same trend as the experimental results.

AB - The influence of four different lateral displacement patterns used for experimental simulation of seismic behavior of masonry walls has been studied. Thirty-two equal reinforced-masonry walls have been tested by imposing monotonically increasing displacements; cyclic lateral displacements with amplitudes, stepwise increasing in predefined blocks of two different shapes and repeated three times at each amplitude peak; and simulated displacement seismic response. By imposing the same displacement pattern dynamically, higher values of lateral resistance and more rigid initial behavior of the walls has been obtained than statically. Higher resistance and larger ultimate displacements have been obtained by monotonic than by cyclic loading procedures of all types. At a higher level of vertical load, lateral resistance of the wall was improved, but deformability and ductility decreased at both, static, and dynamic types of loading at all load patterns.

AB - A method of modifying the lateral load–lateral displacement relationship obtained by a simple monotonic racking test to represent the skeleton hysteresis curve of an arbitrary dynamic response of a reinforced-masonry wall is proposed. The results of tests of 32 equal reinforced-masonry walls, tested by imposing monotonically increasing displacements, cyclic lateral displacements of two different shapes, and simulated displacement seismic response, have been used as a basis for the development of the procedure of modification. The amount of input energy, defined as the actuator work done to deform the specimens during the test, has been taken into account as the decisive parameter for carrying out this modification. On the basis of experimental results, correlation factors between the monotonic and cyclic hysteresis envelope curves, as well as stiffness and strength degradation parameters, which define the hysteretic rules, have been evaluated. Good agreement between predicted and experimental cyclic behavior of the walls has been obtained.

AB - The postpeak behavior of high-strength concrete (HSC) columns, loaded in axial compression, is characterized by strain localization in the concrete leading to the formation of an inclined shear failure plane separating the concrete into two wedges restrained by the cohesion of concrete and the reinforcement steel. A model capable of predicting this postpeak load-displacement behavior of confined HSC columns loaded in axial compression is presented. The proposed descending branch is consistent with the physical phenomena observed from axial compression tests on 62 confined HSC columns from three independent research projects. The proposed model shows that the pseudobrittle failure of HSC columns, loaded in compression, come from the fact that the residual axial capacity of the column after failure is mainly controlled by the lateral load carried by the transverse reinforcement and therefore by its yield strength.

AB - A closed-form solution for the design and analysis of short circular reinforced columns is presented. The technique is based on transforming the components of the cross section, concrete, and steel, into an equivalent elastic material. The classical bending theory is used to develop an interaction formula that facilitates assessment of the performance of such columns. The solution provided accounts for nearly all the parameters that may contribute to the behavior of circular columns. Furthermore, no reference to the strength reduction factor is required in the course of locating the neutral axis. The problem is formulated to allow for the incorporation of strain hardening in reinforcement bars. The results obtained compared in a very satisfactory manner with that obtained using the equilibrium and compatibility approach. Flowcharts outlining the design, analysis, and rapid convergence of the technique are presented.

AB - Sequential coupling is a modification of a structural connection that permits an initial, zero resistance slip (or rotation) at each elastoplastic deformation cycle. A sequential structure is obtained when a specified number of connections of elements connected in parallel are replaced by sequential couplings. This modification decreases the yield resistance whenever the amplitude of an oscillatory deformation response is less than the length of the zero resistance slip, and is restored to its original value when the amplitude of the response exceeds the length of the slip. This property of the sequentially coupled structure increases the amplitudes of the local minimum (due to the reduced yield resistance) and thereby reduces the amplitude of the subsequent local maximum in each oscillatory sequence, resulting is a significant decrease of the global maximum response. The paper discusses this, hereto, unexplored phenomenon and its application to the design of structures subject to seismic excitation. The displacement response of a typical medium rise steel structure was computed by means of a single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model. When sequential connections were introduced, it was found that the peak ductile response decreased by 30–50%. Inserting sequential connections leads to a significant improvement of the performance without increasing the size or number of structural members.

AB - A simple effective algorithm for active structural control is proposed. It applies the control force at every time step, minimizing the system energy that is carried over from one time step to the next. The control force needed for the next time step is computed by a simple closed form solution at the current time utilizing the available information. Therefore, the proposed control algorithm is free from time delay problems. The control algorithm is derived from the theory of single-degree-of-freedom (SDF) systems and is extended to multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDF) systems by making use of the modal synthesis. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law. Practical problems in active control, such as the spillover effect, the actuator's capacity limit, and the problems associated with the limited number of sensors are discussed. Various strategies to cope with these problems, in particular, an artificial neural network as the state estimator, are proposed in the paper. The results of the examples show that the proposed control algorithm can reduce the structural response by one order of magnitude and has the ability to reduce the peak that occurs during the first few cycles of the time history, an ability that linear control laws lack. Unlike most control algorithms that deal with the state space of the system that usually involves complex-valued eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the proposed control algorithm deals with the real-valued normal modes of the system.

AB - The finite-element method was used to create detailed models of horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges connected by cross frames. The effects of a number of parameters on the behavior of the curved girder system were established and compared to the effect of these parameters in straight girder systems. The parameters that most significantly affect the behavior of the systems were determined to be the degree of curvature, span length, and flange width. An equation was developed based on a nonlinear statistical regression to provide a preliminary design limit for the cross-frame spacing interval. The results of the equation were compared to those results obtained by previous equations developed by various methods for the same purpose.

AB - Shear lag occurs not only in bridge decks and framed tubes, but also in shear/core walls. However, there have been relatively few studies on shear lag in wall structures. Moreover, most existing theories neglect shear lag in the webs and, although they are acceptable for bridge decks that normally have flanges wider than webs, they may not be applicable to shear/core walls whose webs can be much wider than flanges. To study the shear lag phenomenon in wall structures, a parametric study using finite-element analysis is carried out. Unlike previous studies that neglected shear lag in the webs, many layers of elements are used for both the webs and flanges so that shear lag in the webs can also be taken into account. The results indicate that the shape of the longitudinal stress distribution in an individual web or flange panel is quite independent of the dimensions of the other panels. Based on this observation, design charts and empirical formulas for estimating the shear lag effects are developed for practical applications.

AB - A study using field test results was conducted to determine the effect of live load for the slab-and-beam bridge structures. From the field testing of four existing bridge structures under the real truck loading, the live load distribution factors (DFs) are deducted from the measured strain gauge values and then determined by using several methods developed by the study team. The final results for each bridge are compared against some of the previously developed methods and design codes. The distribution factor concluded from testing results should be showing lower bound values. Results are given in tabulated forms and conclusions about the distribution factors for each bridge are reached from these tables.

AB - In attempting to define structural damage due to earthquakes, various damage indices have been proposed. Some of these indices account for the damage due to absorbed cyclic energy using the hysteretic behavior of the material. The primary difficulty with calculating the damage lies in modeling the hysteretic behavior of the material. Additionally, detailed ground motion records must exist to provide the input to the model. Natural frequencies have been shown to decrease with increasing damage. These changes in frequency can be related to decreases in stiffness through a perturbation solution of the eigenvalue problem. By reformulating the problem as a constrained minimization problem, the reductions in stiffness may be located. This paper proposes a relationship between these calculated stiffness reductions and the amount of absorbed cyclic energy. With this relationship defined, a method of calculating damage in beams is proposed. This method does not need a model for the hysteretic behavior of reinforced concrete, bypasses the need for performing nonlinear analysis, and does not require ground-motion records. This method would not be limited to calculating the average structural damage.

AB - A simplified structural analysis model for mat foundations with grid floor beams as stiffeners is presented here. In the model, the Winkler type of subgrade reaction spring is assumed for the whole area under the mat foundation, and the yield-line theory of slab is used to lump the Winkler springs under slabs to the corresponding locations under the adjacent floor beams of the slabs. Therefore, each floor beam is now supported by springs with a segmentally linearly varied spring constant. The total analysis model for the mat foundation is then simplified to be a grid beam system on an elastic foundation with a segmentally linearly varied spring constant, and is subjected to loadings from the columns of the building structure. Some numerical comparisons with the results by a sophisticated finite-element model are made in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented analysis model.

AB - The analysis of viscoelastic continua and spatial frames may be related back to the study of the RLC (resistance, inductance, and capacitor lumped constant) electrical network by considering the analogy existing between the stress-strain relationships in the viscoelastic materials and the current-potential relationships in the electric circuits. The proposed analogy is also a consistent tool for the evaluation of creep in spatial structures composed of rectilinear frames. The theoretical bases of this possible application are brought out and a numerical example is presented. The main contribution of this work is the development of the electrical analogy to the solution of dynamic systems excited by time-dependent loads. The theoretical formulation of a free dynamic system is extensively discussed and a numerical example shows its easy applicability to a spatial framework. As far as the analysis of damped structures is concerned, two different models of a single-degree-of-freedom system are proposed.
