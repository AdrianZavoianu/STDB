AB - A procedure for evaluating the seismic performance and retrofit of existing low-to-midrise reinforced concrete (RC) buildings is proposed. The procedure is derived from the well-known capacity spectrum method and is intended to provide practicing engineers with a methodology for estimating the margin of safety against structural failure. A series of seismic story demand curves is established from modal superposition analyses wherein changes in the dynamic characteristics of the structure at various response phases ranging from elastic to full failure mechanism are considered. These demands are compared to the lateral story capacities as determined from an independent inelastic pushover analysis. The distribution of lateral forces used in the progressive pushover analysis is based on stiffness dependent incremental story shear demands and forms a critical aspect of the methodology. The proposed technique is applied to a one-third scale model, three-story reinforced concrete frame building that was subjected to repeated shaking table excitations, and that was later retrofitted and tested again at the same intensities. This study indicates that the procedure can provide reliable estimates of story demands versus capacities for use in seismic performance and retrofit evaluation of structures.

AB - In a knee-brace-frame (KBF), one end of the brace is connected to a short knee element instead of beam-column joint. The brace provides the required lateral stiffness, whereas the ductility is obtained through shear yielding of the knee element. Large-scale dynamic testing of a KBF with shear yielding knee is described in this paper. When a two-story KBF with rolled I-sections as knee members was subjected to base excitation through pseudo-dynamic testing, inducing a shear strain of 0.1, it was found that the KBF could dissipate a large amount of energy without any pinching in the hysteretic loops or significant deterioration in strength and stiffness provided that the knees are designed to inhibit local and lateral-torsional buckling. The test results reveal that the variation of shear stress with the shear strain in the knee could be approximated by a bilinear hysteretic curve with a strain hardening slope of 0.02–0.04. The out-of-plane displacements at the knee-brace joints and vertical displacements at the knee-beam joints are found to be small.

AB - An analytical procedure is presented to model the stiffness and strength of dual panel zones; the dual panel zone in a steel column is formed when the conventional beam-to-column connection in steel moment-resisting frames (MRFs) is enhanced for seismic performance by adding haunches on either or both sides of the column. Based on the results of finite element analysis, a relationship between the unbalanced beam moment and shear deformations in the upper and lower panel zones is established first. Treating the dual panel zone as a two-spring serial system in shear, the equivalent rotational stiffness based on a secant stiffness definition, the yield strength, and the postelastic behavior are derived. The analytical predictions correlate well with the finite element analysis results and available full-scale test results.

AB - Earthquake design codes require different methods of analysis for regular and irregular structures, but it is only recently that codes have included specific criteria that define irregular structures. In this paper, the mass, strength, and stiffness limits for regular buildings as specified by the Uniform Building Code (UBC) are evaluated. The structures studied are two-dimensional building frames with 5, 10, and 20 stories. Six fundamental periods are considered for each structure group. Irregularities are introduced by changing the properties of one story or floor. Floor-mass ratios ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 are considered, and first-story stiffness and strength ratios varying from 1.0 to 0.5 are included. The response is calculated for design ductility levels of 1 (elastic), 2, 6, and 10 for four earthquake records. Conclusions are derived regarding the effects of the irregularities on shear forces and maximum ductility demands. It is found that the mass and stiffness criteria of UBC result in moderate increases in response quantities of irregular structures compared to regular structures. The strength criterion, however, results in large increases in response quantities and thus is not consistent with the mass and stiffness requirements. Based on these findings, several modifications to the criteria are proposed, which include a revised formula for estimating the fundamental period for buildings with nonuniform distributions of mass.

AB - Many of the active devices currently being researched for seismic structural control applications are highly energy intensive. This presents a serious concern for active control since adequate energy sources may not be available during an earthquake. To alleviate this concern, an innovative gravity-actuator control system is proposed herein. This control system minimizes the external energy demand by using the reserve kinetic energy stored in suspended active masses to generate lateral forces for control. An idealized model of the gravity-actuator system is analyzed in detail, and equations governing the dynamic response of this model are derived. An algorithm that uses short-duration force pulses to attenuate the structural response is developed for operation of this control system. Numerical examples considering the response of a seismically excited model structure are presented to assess the performance of the control system and the pulse-control algorithm. Results demonstrate that the gravity-actuator control system is capable of significantly reducing the lateral vibrations of the structure, thereby indicating the proposed control concept to be worthy of continued study.

AB - The effect of brace local inertia (LI) on seismic response of short to medium rise diagonally braced offshore jackets is studied using conventional beam-column finite elements. A range of variables including brace slenderness and structural periods in the practical range and seismic input direction are considered. The results show reductions in the global ductility demand due to LI arising from changes in the brace axial load-displacement hysteresis. This is further scrutinized by analyzing isolated braces under conditions experienced within vibrating jackets and by including a wider range of parameters. Initial increases in the buckling capacity and the overall improvement in energy absorption of brace hysteresis are attributed to “delayed hysteretic behavior” that depends on the fundamental period of brace lateral vibrations and the vibrating period of structure. The procedures for incorporating LI in phenomenological modeling practice are also examined and are found to be unrealistic, particularly with an increase in brace slenderness.

AB - Seismic records obtained during the Loma Prieta earthquake and the Whittier earthquake from 21 buildings were analyzed by a system identification method. The adequacy of current code specifications on building period estimation was discussed. A range of damping ratio was obtained for different building types. Characteristics of frame buildings and shearwall buildings were discussed in terms of the maximum story drift ratio envelope and the frequency ratio between higher modes and the fundamental mode. Torsional responses were found to be prevalent in several cases. The orthogonal effect was revealed indirectly by the concurrent nature of maximum story drift in the two horizontal directions. Large change of vibration frequency was found during the course of the earthquakes in many buildings.

AB - This paper presents the results of an experimental and analytical study that was carried out to improve the understanding of the response of cracked concrete from a fracture mechanics point of view. Reinforced concrete panels made of normaland high-strength concrete were tested under uniaxial tension. A previously proposed fracture energy model was modified to predict the obtained tensile response of both normaland high-strength concrete panels. Steady crack growth was described with energy equilibrium during cracking. A new method is proposed to approximate the effective compliance for a member with multiple cracks. For a given cracking stage, the model can predict concrete and steel strains and entire load-deformation curves. The proposed fracture energy model is also capable of predicting the minimum reinforcement ratio of normaland high-strength concrete tensile members of different sizes.

AB - This paper presents an experimental analysis to establish the fundamental relationship between bond stress, steel stress, and slip in reinforced-concrete structures. Tests were conducted on double pullout specimens reinforced with 25-mm plain round mild steel, cold-worked and hot-rolled ribbed bars that had been fully instrumented internally with electrical resistance strain gauges. The results provided examples of the longitudinal variation of the steel strain (analogous to that between cracks). The method has proved to be capable of providing sufficient data for plotting the distribution of steel stress, bond stress, and slip between flexural cracks. The relationship between bond stress, steel stress, and slip was derived from the steel strain function, and has been represented by empirical formulas.

AB - A limit analysis method for predicting the torsional strength of reinforced concrete beams is introduced in this paper. This method uses the modified Coulomb-Mohr failure criterion as the constitutive law of concrete, and assumes the plastic flow of concrete after yielding to be associated with its failure surface. A generalized formulation for energy dissipation rate along a yield line in accordance with the failure criterion as well as the upper-bound method are employed in this research. The ultimate strength of reinforced concrete beams subjected to pure torsion is then predicted by the work equation based upon the energy dissipation rate and the permissible failure mechanism at the ultimate state. The theoretical torsional strengths are compared with the existing experimental results and they appear to be in good agreement.

AB - A finite-element method is used to analyze a full range of stress and deformation behavior for a concrete slab on grade. The slab is axisymmetrical, one with its circumference restrained horizontally, simulating a portion of a slab with infinite extent. The load is applied on a small circular area located at the center. Winkler's assumption is used to study the subgrade behavior. Using Ottosen's failure criterion for concrete under a multiaxial stress state and considering the nonlinear behavior of concrete, the subgrade reaction, displacement of slab, stresses, bending moments, horizontal thrusts in slab, and position of cracks, and so on are obtained. The analytical results were found to compare well with test observations. Based on this finite-element analysis, a new analytical method for computing the ultimate load-carrying capacity of concrete slabs on grade is proposed.

AB - The numerical analysis of slender cracked and uncracked masonry members—including nonlinear stress-strain relationship, self-weight, and vertical and lateral concentrated and distributed loads—is carried out. Analytical solutions of the stability problem are also provided for large cracked members (large eccentricity in each cross section) by neglecting the self-weight. A finite-element method (FEM) approach, using the Galerkin weighted residuals approach, is developed to study the stability problem for any stress-strain relationship and any load condition of the masonry member. The reliability and the convergence of the proposed nonlinear FEM is evaluated by the comparison of the solutions with available analytical ones and with those obtained by means of another numerical technique. It is shown that the self-weight has a stabilizing effect for large eccentricities of the vertical load, but an unstabilizing effect for small eccentricities. The unstabilizing effect is more marked for nonlinear stress-strain relationships. Dimensionless graphs allowing the resolution of similar practical problems are reported.

AB - A new method for seismic base isolation of ground-supported vertical cylindrical liquid-storage tanks is proposed in which the base plate is supported on a soil bed, and the tank wall is supported on a ring of vertically soft rubber bearings. The isolated system derives its flexibility from rocking and uplifting of the base, and derives its energy-dissipation capacity from base-plate yielding, soil damping, and hysteretic rubber damping. In this analysis, the tank-liquid system is represented by a lumped-mass-stick model, and the rubber bearings are represented by a series of nonlinear hysteretic axial springs. The partially uplifted base plate loaded by liquid is analyzed giving due consideration to the effects of membrane action and plastic yielding. Results demonstrate the ability of the isolation method in reducing significantly the overturning base moments and the axial compressive stresses in the tank wall, while still maintaining the values of base uplifts and plastic rotations in the base plate at reasonable levels.

AB - The general cases of cracked reinforced or prestressed concrete sections under axial load and biaxial or uniaxial bending in the serviceability and ultimate limit states have been treated in five previous papers. The ASCE Journal of Structural Engineering published a paper covering the serviceability limit state of reinforced concrete sections without axial load and with trapezoidal or triangular compression zones. That paper caused reader interest due to the simplicity of solution. However, readers wanted a similar simple method covering sections with axial load. The present technical note aims at filling this gap. At the same time, it is extended to also cover pentagonal compression zones, i.e. all possibilities for rectangular sections.
