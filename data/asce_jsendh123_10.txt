AB - Starting from a description of his four curved concrete arch bridge projects it is shown how Maillart adapted his deck-stiffened arch concept to allow for a horizontally curved deck. Based on this review possible extensions of Maillart's concepts are discussed. For shortand medium-span curved bridges the advantages of longitudinally fixed frame systems with slender inclined columns and post-tensioned deck beams are pointed out. For long-span curved bridges, arch systems with post-tensioned deck beams and generously spaced columns or cross walls are found to offer similar advantages provided that the end supports are fixed and deck and arch are appropriately connected at midspan. For moderate live to dead load ratios an interesting variant is obtained by using a suspension cable instead of an inclined arch and by attaching the hangers along the inner edge of a suitably prestressed deck beam that is clamped at the abutments.

AB - This paper presents the results of the second phase of an ongoing investigation into the behavior of tall cavity masonry walls constructed with partially grouted and reinforced concrete block wythe and a burnt brick wythe tied together with semirigid shear connectors. In the first phase, a test program has been conducted on tall cavity walls under eccentric axial forces. In this phase a nonlinear finite-element analysis model is developed to simulate the database of existing test results. The model represents all components of the cavity wall, the reinforced concrete block backup wythe, the brick wythe, and the shear connectors. It accounts for the nonlinear material behavior of all components as well as the large displacement, small strain characteristics of the deformation. The numerical analysis results are successfully compared with a number of test results. The simulation offers insight into the mode of failure, in particular for walls with high eccentricity ratios. That same model is then used to numerically generate an extensive database to examine the effect of various wall parameters on wall stiffness and ultimate strength.

AB - An analytical macromodel based on an equivalent strut approach integrated with a smooth hysteretic model is proposed for representing masonry infill panels in nonlinear analysis of frame structures. The hysteresis model uses degrading control parameters for stiffness and strength degradation and slip “pinching” that can be implemented to replicate a wide range of hysteretic force-displacement behavior resulting from different design and geometry. The paper presents the development of the hysteretic model and the definitions of the control parameters, which can be determined using any suitable theoretical model for masonry infills. An available theoretical model for simplified engineering evaluation of masonry infilled frames was explored for estimating the control parameters of the proposed macromodel. The macromodel was incorporated in a nonlinear structural analysis program, IDARC2D Version 4.0, for quasi-static cyclic and dynamic analysis of masonry infilled frames. Simulations of experimental force-deformation behavior of prototype infill frame subassemblies are performed to validate the proposed model. A lightly reinforced concrete frame structure is analyzed for strong ground motions to evaluate the influence of masonry infill panels on the dynamic response.

AB - The stability condition of cantilevered masonry piers subjected to their own weight and to a concentrated compressive top load is investigated, considering no-tension material with nonlinear stress-strain law in compression, of an experimental nature, and including softening behavior. The analysis is carried out by improving a numerical approach adopted in previous works where stability problems were solved assuming an infinitely elastic linear constitutive law in compression. Before the geometrical nonlinearity is considered, the limit equilibrium of a typical pier rectangular cross section is detected assuming unlimited available compressive strain. This preliminary analysis allows one to determine analytically the limit value that has to be imposed on the eccentricity of the resultant compressive force and to derive the moment-curvature relationships on which the second-order effects depend. Then the stability domains are derived in dimensionless form and their boundaries are modeled by analytical approximate expressions of practical use. Some numerical examples show that, depending on the average normal stress level, the assumption of an approximate linear constitutive law in compression, affected by the same elasticity modulus as that at the origin of the actual stress-strain law, can provide an unacceptable overestimate of the critical load.

AB - The development and implementation of a general, three-dimensional (3D) embedded bending member suitable for modeling dowel action is presented. The development is motivated by the desire to efficiently model rigid concrete pavement slabs with doweled joints using solid brick elements without requiring the mesh nodes to coincide with the dowel element nodes. All derivations are done with respect to an arbitrarily oriented coordinate system. The stiffness matrix of the embedded dowel element is expressed as a transformation of the unembedded dowel element stiffness matrix, eliminating the need for special integration techniques. Consideration is given to axial debonding of the dowel, as well as the nonlinear case where a gap exists between the dowel and surrounding material. Details of the object-oriented implementation of the element and its incorporation in a general, nonlinear solution strategy are presented. Convergence and parametric studies were performed using a realistic model of two rigid, concrete pavement slabs subjected to static axle loading near the joint. The results of these studies demonstrate the applicability of the element as well as indicating the potential for significant detrimental effects on doweled joint performance when gaps exist between the dowels and the pavements slabs.

AB - This paper presents a nonlinear layered finite element method capable of analyzing cracking and punching shear failure of reinforced concrete flat plates with spandrel beams or torsion strips. Incorporating a layered approach with transverse shear capabilities, the procedure takes into account the full interaction between the spandrel beam and the adjoining slab (in bending, shear, and torsion). The formulation of the nonlinear cracking and failure analysis is discussed in some detail. A comparative study based on a series of 11 half-scale reinforced concrete flat plate models and four single slab-column specimens confirms the method's ability to satisfactorily predict the punching shear strengths, the deflections, and the crack patterns, as well as the collapse loads, of the models. Also included in the comparison is a semiempirical procedure, along with those recommended by the American Concrete Institute, the British Standards Institution, and the Standards Association of Australia. Results show that the proposed method and the semiempirical formulas are more accurate and reliable than those of the three national codes of practice.

AB - The determination of the strength of reinforced concrete slabs with proper consideration of the benefits of compressive membrane action is too complex for regular use by the practicing engineer. Following previous work on plastic flow rules and the relationships between rigid-plastic and elastic-plastic idealizations of laterally restrained one-way spanning slab strips, it is shown that the load at the maximum membrane force is expressed in a very convenient form for use in design. The formulation is given in this paper for strips and square isotropic slabs and is shown to provide a useful approximation of the theoretical full load capacity underestimating it by a margin that is larger when the sensitivity to in-plane stiffness is greater. A comparison is made with laboratory tests and a worked example shows how the parameters are employed.

AB - A triaxial constitutive model for finite-element (FE) analysis of preand postcracking behavior of concrete is presented. A five-parameter ultimate strength envelope is used in the stress space. For compression dominated loading leading to crushing, a modified version of a conceptually simple hypoelastic model is used and augmented to capture the postcrushing strain softening behavior approximately. Various test data on multiaxial loading of concrete are analyzed to verify the capabilities of the model. The postcracking strain softening formulation is based on the fracture energy concept with multiple nonorthogonal crack capability. To maintain the objectivity with respect to mesh refinement, a simple method is proposed to compute the crack band widths within 20-noded solid isoparametric elements. This model is verified by analyzing the postcracking response of a uniaxial tensile member, a test notched beam, and a beam subjected to torsion.

AB - A three-dimensional (3D) model for finite-element (FE) analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) based on smeared cracking approach is presented. The constitutive model for plain concrete has been presented and verified in a companion paper; a simple hypoelastic formulation with modification to approximate the postpeak behavior in compression is used. The postcracking model is based on the fracture energy concept with particular emphasis on mesh objectivity through automatic generation of crack band widths using 20-noded solid isoparametric elements. A distinct feature of the present RC model is the inclusion of bond-slip in the context of embedded representation of reinforcement in 3D, which has been verified by analyzing a RC bar under uniaxial tension. Additional analyses of test specimens including a beam-column-slab assembly are presented to evaluate the merits of the current formulation in 3D applications.

AB - This paper describes experimental and theoretical studies on seismic retrofit of reinforced concrete circular columns with poor lap-splice details using prefabricated composite jacketing. Three 1:2 scale model columns have been tested. One column was tested under the condition of “as built” and two others were tested after being retrofitted using prefabricated composite jacketing. The as-built column suffered brittle failure due to the deterioration of lap-spliced longitudinal reinforcement without developing its flexural capacity or any ductility. The retrofitted columns showed significant improvement in seismic performance. The failed as-built column was retested after being repaired. The repaired column also demonstrated significant improvement in ductility. An analytical model, which takes into consideration the bond-slip deterioration of lap-spliced longitudinal bars, has been developed for seismic assessment and retrofit design.

AB - A basic step in the reliability evaluation of high-strength concrete (HSC) columns is the computation of the statistics of the column strength. However, the nonexistence of a widely accepted model for confined HSC, the unavailability of a closed-form solution to express column strength, and the compatibility with the assumed failure criterion make the computation of the strength statistics of HSC columns a very involved issue. In the present study, the strength statistics of HSC columns are assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. Confinement models for HSC are compared and a deterministic procedure for the computation of the column strength is developed. The strength statistics of 48 reinforced concrete columns representing normal-, high-, and very-high-strength are evaluated. The effects of the amount of confining steel, amount of longitudinal steel, and slenderness ratio are examined. Finally, ductility statistics at three different axial load levels are obtained. The influence of the amount of confining steel on the resulting ductility is also investigated.

AB - High-strength concrete (HSC) has found its main application in the lower columns of high-rise buildings. Due to its large application, type of failure, and importance to structural integrity, the reliability assessment of HSC columns is an extremely important issue. On the other hand, this assessment is a very involved issue. First, a unique formulation of the failure criterion has not yet been established. Second, the moment magnification method, when applied to slender HSC columns, may produce conservative or unconservative estimates of the load effects depending on the load eccentricity. Third, information on the resistance variability of HSC columns is scarce. In this paper, the basic requirements for reliability analysis of HSC columns are presented. A failure criterion is sought, a procedure that does not resort to the moment magnification method is established for the computation of the load effects on slender columns, and probabilistic descriptors of load and resistance of HSC are investigated.

AB - This paper discusses a procedure to calculate current levels of reliability of prestressed concrete connections. The procedure is then utilized to determine the reliability of structural steel haunch connections used in prestressed concrete. The analyses accounted for the variability in loading and the variability in the parameters that comprise the connection strength. A variable model error factor was also developed from previous experimental work and included in the analyses. The analyses accounted for the three failure modes of concrete shear, steel shear, and steel flexure. The results presented in this paper show the reliability index for these types of connections to be relatively low in comparison to levels of reliability found in the majority of design standards in use today. An additional load factor, as suggested in the prestressed concrete industry's design standard, was also incorporated in the analyses. This improved the reliability of the connections, but not to levels that may be expected.

AB - A lifetime optimization methodology for planning the inspection and repair of structures that deteriorate over time is introduced and illustrated through numerical examples. The optimization is based on minimizing the expected total life-cycle cost while maintaining an allowable lifetime reliability for the structure. This method incorporates: (a) the quality of inspection techniques with different detection capabilities; (b) all repair possibilities based on an event tree; (c) the effects of aging, deterioration, and subsequent repair on structural reliability; and (d) the time value of money. The overall cost to be minimized includes the initial cost and the costs of preventive maintenance, inspection, repair, and failure. The methodology is illustrated using the reinforced concrete T-girders from a highway bridge. An optimum inspection/repair strategy is developed for these girders that are deteriorating due to corrosion in an aggressive environment. The effect of critical parameters such as rate of corrosion, quality of the inspection technique, and the expected cost of structural failure are all investigated, along with the effects of both uniform and nonuniform inspection time intervals. Ultimately, the reliability-based lifetime approach to developing an optimum inspection/repair strategy demonstrates the potential for cost savings and improved efficiency.

AB - Application of orthotropic constitutive models to lumber with cross grain requires transformation of coordinates when material axes are not aligned with board axes. This paper presents a procedure to construct the coordinate transformation matrix using angles measured on the surface of a board for any orientation of wood fibers and growth rings within the board. Procedures in the literature are limited to special orientations of the wood material, although their authors have not always recognized the limitations. The key to the present method is the recognition that for each set of three independent surface angles there corresponds a set of Euler angles that can be used in the coordinate transformation matrix. Numerical examples show that the procedure identifies significant variations in board elastic properties for changes in the grain and ring angles. The examples also reveal potentially critical material shear stresses in uniaxial situations following stress transformations associated with combinations of seemingly small angles.

AB - This study investigates the performance of 38 by 89 mm (1.5 by 3.5 in.) parallel-strand lumber columns. Currently, the 1991 national design specification of the American Forest and Paper Association for columns includes a c factor that describes the interaction of columns between the pure crushing and stability failure modes. For wood material, c is a combination of member straightness, material inhomogeneity, and stress-strain plasticity. The objective of our study is to determine an appropriate c value for parallel-strand lumber. Columns of several lengths are axially loaded to failure. Based on the nonlinear least-squares fit of column results, adjusted to a common moisture content, the most probable value of c for parallel-strand lumber is 0.86. This increased c value is attributed to the greater homogeneity and straightness of the manufactured columns.

AB - The subject matter of this paper is essentially an extension of the moment distribution method of analysis and with the aim of offering a simple approach to the construction of influence line diagrams for continuous structures, the members of which can be either of constant or of variable cross section. The distributions of the fixed-end moments are similar to the Hardy-Cross approach except that they are performed algebraically rather than by successive arithmetical approximations. The results are a series of simple equations with only one unknown, which can be easily evaluated with the aid of a desk calculator or by elementary programming for the computer. These simple equations can be expanded to include the effects of sway. They also include the effects of degrees of end fixation.
