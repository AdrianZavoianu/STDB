AB - The Montgomery Block building is used as a case study to assess the effectiveness of conventional analysis methods commonly used by practicing engineers throughout North America when conducting seismic evaluation work to predict the seismic performance of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings. This building predominantly constructed of URM pier-and-spandrel facades and URM shear walls was built in 1853 and survived the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake despite being roughly 15 km from the San Andreas Fault that ruptured in 1906. It is found that the impact of engineering modeling assumptions can be of nearly an order of magnitude for buildings of that type, depending on the structural model selected by the engineer. Of all the conventional modeling procedures considered in this paper, it is found that only the special procedure of the Uniform Code for Building Conservation (UCBC) comes close to predicting the observed seismic response. However, some extensions of the more conventional modeling procedures are useful in demonstrating the potentially beneficial period elongation that accompanies structural strength degradation as damage progresses.

AB - Earthquake analysis of bridges requires that the period and damping ratio be determined for each significant mode of vibration. Data on these vibration properties, identified from motions of bridges recorded during actual earthquake events, provide the most direct means of verifying and improving the current guidelines. Thus, the aim of this investigation was to measure the vibration properties of a two-span concrete bridge from its motions recorded during actual earthquake events. These data were then used to investigate how abutment participation affected the vibration properties of bridges with integral abutments. It is shown that the vibration period elongated and the damping ratio increased by a factor of over two as the intensity of ground shaking increased. These changes primarily were caused by increased abutment participation with increased intensity of shaking. Finally, the damping data were used to develop empirical formulas for estimating upper and lower bound values of damping in the first transverse vibration mode of bridges with integral abutments.

AB - An energy-based approach has been used to investigate the seismic behavior of code-designed asymmetric-plan systems. The systems considered in this investigation had large eccentricities in both directions, were designed for bidirectional earthquake loading, and their responses were computed with both components of ground motion acting simultaneously. The presented results demonstrate that the total input energy is about the same whether the system plan is symmetric or asymmetric. Furthermore, flexible-side elements in asymmetric-plan systems may be more vulnerable to earthquakes than the same elements in symmetric-plan systems if they are not designed to accommodate the higher hysteretic-energy demands. This observation correlates well with the damage observed in street corner buildings during several earthquakes. Stiff-side elements, on the other hand, are expected to suffer no more damage in asymmetric-plan systems than in symmetric-plan systems.

AB - Most seismic codes specify empirical formulas to estimate the fundamental vibration period of buildings. Evaluated first in this paper are the formulas specified in present U.S. codes using the available data on the fundamental period of buildings “measured” from their motions recorded during eight California earthquakes, starting with the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and ending with the 1994 Northridge earthquake. It is shown that, although the code formulas provide periods that are generally shorter than measured periods, these formulas can be improved to provide better correlation with the measured data. Subsequently, improved formulas for estimating the fundamental periods of reinforced concrete (RC) and steel moment-resisting frame buildings are developed by regression analysis of the measured period data. Also recommended are factors to limit the period calculated by a rational analysis, such as Rayleigh's method.

Various geometrical configurations of the frame and the infill walls and different material types of the masonry walls are considered. Based on the results, a hysteresis model for infilled frames is formulated and discussed. All parameters in the model have physical meaning and are calibrated with experimental data.

AB - A general three-dimensional (3D) model of light-frame wood buildings is presented. The model has the capabilities of dealing with different structural configurations and different types of loading. Comprehensive verification studies are performed to check the accuracy of the model by comparing with some available experimental data. The proposed model shows excellent correlation with the experimental data. As an application, investigations are conducted to evaluate the seismic response of light-frame wood buildings with different geometric configurations. The effects of the asymmetric in-plane stiffness, dimensions of the horizontal diaphragm, the presence of partition walls, and the ground motion intensity on the structural response are studied. The corresponding load distribution of lateral forces among the shear walls and the deflections of horizontal diaphragms are the main parameters of this study. The application study indicates that rigidity of the horizontal diaphragm is influenced by its dimensions and that partition walls resist a substantial amount of seismic forces depending on their stiffness and the dimensions of the horizontal diaphragm.

AB - Although some past experimental studies indicate that the monotonic structural ductility of steel is not detrimentally affected by severe corrosion, no study has investigated whether such severely rusted members can reliably exhibit the stable cyclic ductile behavior necessary for seismic survival. To generate preliminary data, a few rusted pieces taken from an existing steel bridge have been subjected to numerous cycles of alternating plasticity in flexure. Specimens had up to a 60 loss of cross-sectional area because of corrosion. This limited test program revealed that, although stable hysteretic behavior comparable with that of unrusted specimen is possible, premature failure under alternating plasticity can typically develop (in spite of satisfactory ductile behavior under monotonic loading). Irregularities along the severely rusted surface apparently act as crack initiators and precipitate crack propagation throughout the section.

AB - Thin plate panels in steel-plate shear walls buckle at very small load and the strength of the wall is based on the postbuckling strength of its plate panels. The plate panels can be modeled using equivalent truss elements in the diagonal tension direction. The load-elongation characteristics of these elements are elastic, elastoplastic, and perfectly plastic. The load-elongation characteristics were derived using a strip-gusset element. The gusset area represents the shear zone close to the supported boundaries, which yields in shear before buckling. The load-elongation characteristics for walls where the plate panels are welded to the surrounding beams and columns are different than for walls with bolted plate panels. Test specimens were modeled using the equivalent truss element and the analytical results compared, to a good degree of accuracy, with the test results for monotonic as well as cyclic loading.

AB - Large floor vibration amplitudes can produce disruption and reduced efficiency in employees, and in more extreme cases can result in complete abandonment of a structure for its intended use. The implementation of active control to reduce vibration levels in lightweight floor systems is explored in this paper. A velocity feedback scheme has been developed in which an electromagnetic proof-mass actuator is used to impart control forces on a floor system, thus, reducing the amplitudes of the floor motion. The development, analysis, and experimental verification are discussed for the successful implementation of this control application. A full-scale experimental test floor was designed, constructed, and modeled analytically for this study. Both analytical and experimental results for the floor response to transient excitation show an increase in damping from approximately 2.5% to 40%. Experimental results for walking excitation show a reduction of peak velocity amplitudes to 12% of amplitudes recorded for the uncontrolled system.

AB - This paper presents and discusses the dynamic behavior of two bridge decks. The experimental tests were performed to explain the dynamic performance of one of them: its vertical displacements and accelerations are appreciably greater than those of every other deck in the same bridge, despite similar geometrical and mechanical properties. The experimental data were used to identify the modal parameters of the decks, which have close frequencies. A simultaneous analysis using a two-degrees of freedom (DOF) model, which exhibits dynamic characteristics similar to the first modes of the deck, was carried out. It showed that, when coupled frequencies occur, the sensitivity of the response to the properties of both the system and the excitation is very high, which may explain the difference in the displacements observed.

AB - The objective of this study is to develop an element that is both accurate and efficient for modeling the vehicle-bridge interaction (VBI) in analysis of railway bridges carrying high-speed trains, which may consist of a number of cars in connection. In this study, a train is modeled as a series of sprung masses lumped at the bogie positions and a bridge with track irregularities by beam elements. Two sets of equations of motion that are coupled can be written, one for the bridge and the other for each of the sprung masses. To resolve the problem of coupling, the sprung mass equation is first discretized using Newmark's finite difference formulas and then condensed to that of the bridge element in contact. The element derived is referred to as the vehicle-bridge interaction element, which has the same number of degrees of freedom (DOF) as the parent element, while possessing the properties of symmetry and bandedness in element matrices. For this reason, conventional assembly procedures can be employed to forming the structure equations. The applicability of the VBI element is demonstrated in the numerical studies.

AB - When analyzing steel frames subjected to dynamic loads, several geometrical and material nonlinearities can be encountered in the early stages of loading. These include second-order effects, and semirigid connection and panel zone nonlinearities, respectively. The well-known modal superposition procedure, which is a very popular method for linear dynamic analysis, can be easily modified to perform nonlinear analysis while retaining many of the advantages of the method in the linear range. These modifications are developed in this paper. Element models are derived for panel zone elements and for two types of connection moment-rotation curves. Several approximations of panel zone behavior are also examined and a sample frame is analyzed. Extensive numerical studies are presented. The methodology presented was found to be both a useful and relatively fast method for nonlinear dynamic analysis of steel frames. It was also found that connection and panel zone behavior affect frame behavior and, hence, must be considered in the dynamic analysis. Connection and panel zone behavior are particularly important when frame drift is the controlling criterion in the design, as tends to be the case for taller frames.

AB - Nonlinear consolidation analysis using a finite-element (FE) formulation based on Biot's consolidation theory has been used to study the time-dependent behavior of three-dimensional (3D) frame structures resting on an elastic or elastic perfectly plastic soil satisfying the Drucker-Prager yield criterion. The effect of soil consolidation on the behavior of a 3D frame-raft-soil mass system is considered. The initial stress method with a modified Newton-Raphson iterative scheme has been used for this study. A coupled finite-infinite element modelization is used for the physical representation of the system. Time history of axial forces and bending moments of the mat foundation and the structural elements (beams and columns) are compared with those of time-independent analysis. The results show that the consolidation of soil increases the internal forces in some elements, so that checking the final forces in the frame by time-independent conventional frame analysis may not be sufficient.

AB - An important advantage of cold-formed steel is the greater flexibility of cross-sectional shapes and sizes available to the structural steel designer. However, the lack of standard optimized shapes makes the selection of the most economical shape very difficult if not impossible. This task is further complicated by the complex and highly nonlinear nature of the rules that govern their design. A general mathematical formulation and computational model is presented for optimization of cold-formed steel beams. The nonlinear optimization problem is solved by adapting the robust neural dynamics model of Adeli and Park, patented recently at the U.S. Patent Office. The basis of the design can be American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) allowable stress design (ASD) or load and resistance factor design (LRFD) specifications. The computational model has been applied to three different commonly used types of cross-sectional shapes: hat-, I-, and Z-shapes. The robustness and generality of the approach have been demonstrated by application to three different examples. This research lays the mathematical foundation for automated optimum design of structures made of cold-formed shapes. The result would be more economical use of cold-formed steel.

Two types of dynamic forces were observed, one from crowd reactions after exciting plays and the other from rhythmic cheering. Dynamic load factors for rhythmic activities were less than 0.15 for the first harmonic and less than 0.05 for the second harmonic. No significant horizontal forces were recorded.
