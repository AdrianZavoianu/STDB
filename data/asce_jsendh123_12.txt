AB - This paper and its companion present a detailed comparison of the approaches for design of beam-columns in steel frameworks specified in the present American, Canadian, European, and Australian limit states design standards. The papers also describe and evaluate a simple modification to the current AISC LRFD Specification approach that avoids the need to calculate column effective length factors. This paper discusses the various philosophies and procedures for beam-column design and summarizes the key similarities and differences among the current approaches. To ease the comparison of the approaches, the equations for checking of beam-column strengths are expressed using a unified notation.

The papers also describe and evaluate a simple modification to the current AISC LRFD Specification approach that avoids the need to calculate column effective length factors. This paper concentrates on several elucidatory examples that highlight distinct advantages and limitations in each of the design approaches. The factored design strengths predicted by each of the approaches are compared to one another, and to the results from rigorous plastic zone analyses using these benchmark problems. The paper concludes by suggesting possible changes that can lead to improvements in the accuracy and/or simplicity of the design procedures.

AB - The main objective of the work presented in this paper is to propose a design equation to predict and check the ultimate load capacity of short and slender concrete-encased square and rectangular composite columns under uniaxial or biaxial bending moments and axial load. The proposed design equation satisfies basic analysis and design parameters of both the American Concrete Institute (ACI) and the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC). It is simple to use, and is compatible with the principles of equilibrium—consistent deformation and structural stability. The second order effects on slender columns are considered by incorporating a moment magnification factor similar to the one used by the ACI for reinforced concrete columns, with the appropriate adjustments for rectangular composite columns. The proposed design equation was used to predict the ultimate axial load capacity of more than 80 square and rectangular composite column specimens. The analytical results were compared with the actual test results and current ACI and AISC design methods. The accuracy obtained in predicting the ultimate axial load capacity and checking the design of a composite section under uniaxial or biaxial bending moments and axial load confirms the validity of the proposed design equation.

AB - Cold formed structural members are fabricated from sheet steels which must meet various material requirements prescribed in applicable national design standards. These requirements ensure that (1) Stress concentrations can be redistributed; and (2) members and connections can undergo a minimum amount of displacement without a loss in structural performance. The 1996 Australian/New Zealand (AS/NZS 4600) and 1996 North American (CSA-S136 and AISI), Cold Formed Steel Design Standards allow for the use of thin (t&lt; 0.9 mm), high strength (fy= 550 MPa) sheet steels if the yield stress and ultimate strength are reduced to 75% of their minimum specified values. This paper provides a summary of results detailing the ductility and net cross-section tensile resistance of G550 sheet steels (to the 1993 Australian Standard AS 1397), tested as solid and perforated coupons. Material properties of the test specimens are compared with the Dhalla and Winter requirements for ductility and ultimate strength to yield stress ratio. Limit states tensile design equations are calibrated according to procedures defined by the 1996 American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) Commentary.

AB - Extended end-plate connections are usually regarded as rigid connections. This recognition has not been investigated systematically in frame analysis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the degree of rigidity of extended end-plate connections utilizing the experimental moment-rotation data of steel beam-to-column connections stored in an updated database. It is revealed from this study that all of the real extended end-plate connections stored in the database may not serve the purpose of rigid connection. About 49 of these connections have an initial connection stiffness &lt;105.05 kN-m/rad (106 kip-in./rad). These connections may be regarded as semirigid connections. Those connections whose initial connection stiffness are &gt;105.05 kN-m/rad (106 kip-in./rad) may be classified as rigid connections depending upon their ultimate moment capacity. These conclusions are compared with two systems of connection classifications.

AB - The fatigue behavior of load-carrying cruciform fillet welded joints has been studied extensively using the dual boundary element method. This method, which incorporates two independent boundary integral equations, uses the displacement equation to model one of the crack boundaries and the traction equation to model the other. As a consequence, the analysis of the welded joints can be performed effectively in a single-region formulation. It is shown that the stress intensity factors (SIFs) at the weld toe and at the weld root are approximately equal when γ and λ are equal to 1.0 and 1.7, respectively, where γ and λ are the ratios of the embedded crack length 2a, and weld leg length w, to the main plate thickness T. In other words, the weld size, w, should be &lt;1.7 times the main plate thickness in order for the crack to propagate from the weld root. Using these conditions, the magnification factor, Mk, and the SIFs, K, at the weld root, are calculated using the J-integral in the analysis. They are compared directly with the results derived from the code of practice. Finally, an attempt is made to estimate the theoretical fatigue life of such welded joints using the two approaches.

AB - This paper reports part of the results of an investigation devoted to the analysis of unstiffened flush end-plate steel-bolted joints by means of the finite-element technique. The flush end-plate joint represents an extremely complex and highly indeterminate analytical problem with a large number of parameters affecting its structural behavior. With the advent of high-speed computers and powerful finite-element software packages, the finite-element method offers an ideal tool for tackling such a complex problem. A sophisticated three-dimensional model of the joint is developed and a nonlinear analysis, using the LUSAS finite-element package, is presented. Full-scale tests of a number of flush end-plate joints have been performed. Finally, comparison between computed and measured values has been carried out, which allows the accuracy of the finite-element prediction model to be highlighted.

AB - An annular plate ringbeam at the transition junction of a uniformly-supported steel silo or tank is subject to a large circumferential compressive force that is derived from the radial component of the meridional tension in the conical hopper. Under this compressive force, the ringbeam may fail in one of several possible modes, including out-of-plane buckling. This paper presents an investigation into the effects of various factors on the plastic out-of-plane buckling behavior and strength of this ringbeam, leading to the eventual development of a simple plastic buckling approximation for design use. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated through an example.

AB - Beam-columns of a doubly symmetric cross section generally experience overall buckling in a lateral-torsional mode. Members with thin webs and stocky flanges have been shown in a number of studies to buckle in a so-called lateral-distortional mode, involving distortion of the web of the I-section in the plane of its cross section. For simply supported members, it has been shown further that the effects of this web distortion in reducing the overall buckling load is not great. This is not the case for members with elastic restraint, where distortion of the web can be of significance in the buckling behavior. This paper develops a general line-type finite element with 16 degrees of freedom that can be used to study the elastic buckling of restrained I-section beam-columns. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated, and the stability of an elastically restrained half-through girder is studied.

AB - Reinforced concrete (RC) bridges deteriorate with time. This results in reduction of their resistance, and, consequently, of their reliability. Corrosion of embedded reinforcing steel is one of the main causes of deterioration. The paper presents a method for reliability assessment of RC slab bridges with corroded reinforcement. The method includes a traffic load model, a corrosion model, and a nonlinear finite element structural model. Two types of corrosion—general corrosion, including spalling and debond between concrete and the corroded reinforcement, and localized corrosion—are considered. Reliability is estimated in terms of the reliability index using the first-order reliability method. Uncertainties associated with material properties, geometry, loads, and corrosion parameters are taken into account. A sensitivity analysis of a simple span bridge is carried out to examine the influence of these uncertainties on the bridge reliability. Reliability assessment of a deteriorated three-span continuous bridge illustrates the application of the method.

AB - An investigation of unbalanced or drifted snow loading on single gable roofs is presented. A database of 28 case histories was developed and analyzed to identify trends and key parameters for this type of roof snow drift. The analysis suggests that roof slope, roof width (i.e., ridge to eave distance), and ground snow load are the key parameters influencing drift size. Furthermore, substantial drifts near the eaves of low sloped roofs (slope less than 15°) are possible, particularly if the width is large and the ground snow load is moderate. A number of simple relations were developed that can be used to predict the total height for low sloped roofs. Predicted values from these relations were compared with observed values to gauge their relative accuracy. It is felt that the simple relations developed herein are an improvement over current code provisions, specifically for low sloped gable roofs. It is expected that they will be the basis for proposed changes in building codes and load standards. The implications of the proposed changes are illustrated in a design example.

AB - A live-load survey was performed on classrooms of several public schools in Mexico City. The results obtained were used in a probabilistic Monte Carlo analysis oriented to obtaining the distribution function of the maximum total live loads on classrooms for different areas and for a 100-year time interval. The exceedance probabilities of the values specified by the Federal District Mexican Building Code, RCDF-1993, and by ASCE7-1995 are calculated. The probabilities found for RCDF-1993 are excessively small. Based on this, a new design live load value is proposed for this code.

AB - Creep testing of oriented strand board/foam structural insulated panels (SIPs) was conducted to measure the midspan creep deflections of SIP beams loaded in quarter point and to test the effects of SIP thickness, load duration, as well as core shear stress. A relative deflection relationship was generated for both the expanded polystyrene (EPS) and urethane SIPs from the faw creep deflection data that had been screened based on previously determined limits of viscoelastic linearity. A five element, four element, and three element viscoelastic model along with a power model were all used in the validation procedure to predict the three month relative creep deflection. EPS SIPs were tested at the 2/3 stress level for six months to determine the model capability in predicting relative deflections beyond the experimental time span. Both the five element and the power model were recommended for predicting the EPS and urethane SIP relative deflections for the three month load duration.

AB - This paper summarizes results from the first phase of a study to evaluate the lateral resistance of wood based shear walls without openings, built with regular and nonstandard large dimension oriented strand board panels under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. Furthermore, different types and spacings of panel-frame connectors were investigated. Results of the second phase, which considered shear walls with openings, are presented in a subsequent paper. The results of the first phase indicate that under monotonic loading, a substantial increase in both stiffness and lateral load carrying capacity, as well as comparable ductility ratios, can be achieved by shear walls built with oversize panels, compared to regular panels. The walls built with regular panels, however, were found to dissipate more energy under cyclic loading than the walls built with oversize panels. The failure modes were substantially different under monotonic (nail withdrawal) and cyclic (nail fatigue) test conditions, which raised the question as to whether the adopted cyclic loading schedules realistically represent the loading sequence expected under wind and earthquake loading.

AB - Structural identification is a powerful concept that permits rational characterizations of constructed facilities and their loading environments. Potential uses of structural identification to solve numerous problems related to condition assessment of civil infrastructure are proposed. Definitions and terminology related to the concept are formulated. The experimental, analytical, and information tools that are needed for a successful structural identification of a constructed facility are discussed. Experimental techniques that permit effective structural identification applications to highway bridges have been validated and demonstrated on an operating steel-stringer highway bridge serving as a test bed. Experiences gained during the applications of different forms of modal analysis and instrumented monitoring are presented with example experimental data and results. Hardware, software, and design requirements for field experiments are discussed.

AB - The stress that causes local buckling is related to the width/thickness ratio of the element in compression. In current codes for the strength design of shapes cold formed from sheet metal, the presence of corner bend radii is treated by considering only the “flat width” portion of the element. This can lead to serious errors in the predicted buckling stress. An analysis of the influence of the corner radii is given together with the justification that the full distance between the intersections of the median lines of the elements be used for the design of typical cold formed shapes. In the case of simple formed angle shapes, a radiused bend at the heel actually reduces the critical stress. For trapezoidal deck sections and box shapes the critical stress calculated using the distance between the intersections of the median lines is not significantly influenced by the presence of corner radii &lt;1/20 of the plate width. The theoretical critical stress is compared with that obtained using the “flat width,” which is shown to be unconservative.
