AB - Two- and three-dimensional analyses for truss structures are reviewed with a particular focus on progressive failure. The review begins with a general discussion of truss structures followed by a presentation of the geometric nonlinear formulations for these structures. Member failure models and their implementation into truss analyses are discussed next; first elastic postbuckling member failure then member failure models including inelastic postbuckling response. This is followed by an overall discussion of quasi-static constitutive models, both analytical and empirical. A review of several papers on the dynamic analysis of truss structures for defining dynamic stability and dynamic progressive failure is presented next, concluding with a brief discussion on hysteretic material behavior. A very brief discussion of some stochastic or probabilistic investigations into truss response and behavior is also included. The paper concludes with a recommended strategy for determining both the static and dynamic progressive failure of truss structures.

AB - This paper describes a kind of innovative posttensioned and shaped hypar space truss characterized by an economical fabrication and construction process. The hypar truss, assembled initially in a planar square layout on the ground, is posttensioned at the short bottom chords at one diagonal. As a result, the top chords become curved and thereby a nonzero Gaussian curvature surface of a hypar space truss is shaped. A distinguishing feature of posttensioned and shaped hypar trusses, compared with conventional metal trusses, is that the shape formation and erection is completed by a simple posttensioning process, rather than by the traditional techniques involving the use of cranes and scaffolding. The essential aspects of shape formation are discussed and a small-scale posttensioned and shaped hypar is formed in this paper. Results of experiment and nonlinear finite-element analysis indicate that, even within the yield limit of the members, a planar square layout can be deformed to a significant hypar shape by the proposed shape formation method. Potentially, this procedure can offer economies over traditional construction methods.

AB - Cold-formed steel structures are used extensively in buildings. The use of structural frames and trusses fabricated from cold-formed steel sections is increasing. A key element in the manufacturing of such structures is the nature of the connection between sections. Many conventional connection techniques have some disadvantages. The paper describes and summarizes a major investigation into the application of a new technique, known as press-joining. An extensive program of small-scale shear and bending tests was carried out. A series of full-scale trusses was constructed and tested. It is shown that effective structures can be constructed using the technique. A theoretical method for predicting the strength of joints is presented.

AB - In steel-concrete composite beams particular attention has to be paid to the fatigue phenomena in the connection. If each part of the structure behaves elastically the problem can be faced with the classical load-life fatigue approach, but for long-span beams, the slip at interface may reach values that involve inelastic deformation of the connector. In this case the failure of some connectors for fatigue with a low number of cycles may occur. Due to shear load redistribution along the connection the load-life approach has to be substituted with a strain-life approach. The slip history of each connector beyond the elastic range depends on the behavior of the whole structure. The life to failure of the connector for low-cycle fatigue was experimentally determined using a particular direct shear test. Eight tests were performed for different values of slip amplitude and for a given slip history. The life to failure domain is presented.

AB - To extend previous research on obtaining designs that rely on a second-order inelastic hinge analysis to demonstrate that a structure is adequate in resisting the effects of factored loads, this paper presents a study of a series of two-story planar steel frames where all columns are subjected to combinations of axial force and minor-axis bending. Inelastic designs, which are prepared to satisfy both strength and serviceability limit states requirements, are compared to designs obtained using a conventional second-order elastic analysis in conjunction with the AISC LRFD Specification. The degree of accuracy and reliability of using a concentrated plasticity analysis to model system behavior is also established. The study indicates that for a majority of the frames investigated, a second-order inelastic hinge analysis can be used effectively to design steel structures. It is also shown that in some cases a distributed plasticity analysis may be required.

AB - It is prohibitively expensive to store M-ϕ relationships for all practical connection types and sizes. Therefore, an appropriate solution is to derive and store a single “standardized” moment-rotation function for each connection type in terms of its geometric parameters. To that end, a parametric study was carried out using three-dimensional (3D) model of the connection through inelastic finite element analysis. The paper evaluates previous standardized functions used to model M-ϕ characteristics and includes a discussion of the important parameters affecting connection behavior. The study covers connection to a column stiffened at the beam tension and compression flanges together with a column with no stiffener in the tension region. The effect of column flange strength, especially for a light column even when stiffened, is emphasized throughout the paper.

AB - Based on current knowledge of connection behavior and the evaluation of previous models provided in a former companion paper, the Richard-Abbott power function, a four-parameter model, is adopted in this study to represent the major M-ϕ relationship of extended end-plate connections. The paper presents the characteristics of the model together with a multiple-regression analysis procedure for deriving its parameters in terms of the connection description. The initial stiffness and moment parameters are also expressed as a linear combination of beam, column, and joint geometric subparameters. The analytic formulation is developed in two categories. The first part includes 34 cases of extended end plates connected to a column stiffened at the beam tension and compression flanges and the second group consists of 19 connections with no stiffener in the tension region. The practical application of the suggested predictive equations is demonstrated for both cases.

AB - The behavior and strength of hot rolled beams and fabricated plate girders, subjected to localized edge or patch loading in the plane of the web, is analyzed. Numerous tests carried out over the past 50 years have indicated that failure occurs due to web crippling, which is characterized by elastoplastic postbuckling of the web plate accompanied by the formation of a plastic collapse mechanism in the flange. The tests have also indicated that ultimate loads are approximately proportional to the square of the web plate thickness, other parameters such as web depth, flange width and thickness, and even material yield strength, being relatively much less significant. Available test results are summarized and previously developed mechanism solutions for patch loading between vertical web stiffeners are modified to provide improved predictions of failure loads. The mechanism solutions are also reduced to simple closed form equations for routine practical application, which are adapted to predict web crippling failures at simple end supports.

AB - Minimum weight design of steel moment-resisting space frame structures with or without bracing subjected to the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) specification is presented. The LRFD constraints for moment-resisting frames are highly nonlinear and implicit functions of design variables (cross-sectional areas). The structure is subjected to wind loading according to the Uniform Building Code (UBC) in addition to the vertical loads due to dead and live loads. A scaling procedure is developed that results in fast convergence. The algorithm is applied to minimum weight design of four large high-rise steel building structures ranging in height from 20 to 81 stories and in size from 1,920 to 9,245 members. A comparison of designs of space moment-resisting frames based on the AISC LRFD code with those based on the AISC Allowable Stress Design (ASD) code shows the former results in a lighter structure for the examples presented.

AB - The optimization of three-dimensional (3D) reinforced concrete frames is discussed. The validity of the assumption that optimum concrete-section dimensions are insensitive to the number, diameter, and longitudinal distribution (topology) of reinforcing bars is examined. The validity of this assumption is examined by comparing optimum results from a multilevel method that simultaneously optimizes concrete-section dimensions and the number, diameter, and topology of the reinforcing bars to a traditional method that represents the number, diameter, and topology of the reinforcing bars through the single design variable, As, the total area of steel. Based on results from the comparison, a new method, referred to as the simplified method, is presented and recommended as the most efficient method for the optimization of reinforced concrete frames. The methods are applied to 3D one-, two-, and four-story frames subjected to load combinations involving dead, live, snow, and seismic loads.

AB - In this paper, the problem of spherical masonry domes of uniform strength is examined. For masonry domes of variable thickness it is proved that the change in the sign of the circumferential stresses can occur for considerably larger angles, depending on the shape of the shell profile. The uniform strength thickness is explicitly given solving an eigenvalue problem associated to the equilibrium integral equation. The thickness law for the closed dome subject to self-weight and, possibly, to a superimposed uniform distributed load, and for the open dome subject to the weight of a lantern is obtained. Finally, the problem for a dome exhibiting a bidimensional behavior in the upper calotte and a one-dimensional (1D) behavior below is solved. Masonry is assumed to be a material not able to resist against tensile stresses. Moreover, it is assumed to be either indefinitely resistant in compression or with a cutoff in compressive stresses.

AB - In structural optimization problems, conventional approximations are often used. For this type of approximations, move limits are usually defined as allowable changes in design variables during optimization of the approximate problem. This paper shows that these common move limit constraints, which are suitable for first-order series approximations, might not be effective for various improved approximations. The improved approximations, developed in recent years and used extensively in various applications, require more effective constraints. Such alternative move limits, proposed in this paper, include angle move limits, which are explicit nonlinear constraints on the angle between the initial and the modified design lines and error move limits, which are implicit nonlinear constraints on the errors in the equilibrium equations. The effectiveness of the aforementioned types of move limit constraints is demonstrated by various numerical examples. It is shown that, for improved approximations, the proposed move limits provide more reasonable results than the common approach.

AB - Through the use of active controllers, a structure can modify its behavior during dynamic loadings such as impact, wind, or earthquake loadings. Such structures with self-modification capabilities are called smart structures. The smart-structure technology will have enormous consequences in terms of preventing loss of life and damage to structure and its content specially for large structures with hundreds of members. In this paper, a computational model is presented for active control of large adaptive structures subjected to dynamic loadings such as impact, wind, and earthquake loadings. The governing differential equations of the open-loop and closed-loop systems are formulated, and a recursive approach is presented for computing the response of the structure. A robust parallel-vector algorithm is developed for the recursive solution of the response of the open-loop and closed-loop systems. The computational model is applied to active control of large bridge structures. Three different schemes are investigated for optimal placement of controllers in bridge structures. Results are presented for three types of bridge structures: single-span, multispan continuous, and curved steel-truss bridges.

AB - For important structures, it is increasingly required that catastrophic failure of the entire structure be prevented. Failure of an element due to an accidental event must not result in progressive collapse of other elements or of the whole structure. Studies to comply with this requirement for a bridge of numerous spans are presented. Dynamic analyses with experimental verification show that inappropriate choice of the statical system can produce a structure vulnerable to progressive collapse. The study indicates, for the considered bridge, a load case that must be considered in the design of sections to prevent progressive collapse.

AB - The paper refers to established theory for the flutter of long-span bridges. Within that theory it is shown that the assumption of a spanwise diminution of coherence in the flutter derivatives can account for the observed phenomenon that turbulence in the cross wind raises the critical speed of instability. This finding is supported by data from two recent model studies of the aerodynamic stability of the Golden Gate Bridge. In this illustrative case the flutter instability condition is uniquely dependent upon a single torsional mode, the aerodynamic damping of which is influenced in a pronounced manner as changes in spanwise coherence effects are postulated. Overall, an observed increase of flutter velocity by 10 to 20% over that under smooth flow is theoretically accounted for.

AB - Remote bridge-monitoring systems based on measured structural vibration have been perceived to be able to assist in bridge inspection for future. Sensitivity of measured modal properties to potential damage is very critical for their practical application, which is examined here. Modal tests were conducted on a one-sixth scale multiple steel-girder model bridge and a fracture critical field bridge, including both intact and simulated damage states. Sensitivity of modal parameters to changes of structural condition was studied using statistical methods (for frequencies, damping ratios, mode shapes, and their derivatives). Results show that, even though modal frequencies and mode shapes may be used to identify the existence of commonly observed bridge damage with certain sensitivity, it is difficult to identify their locations.
