AB - This paper reports an experimental program conducted to measure the transfer lengths (or transmission lengths) of pretensioned seven-wire strands in pretensioned concrete specimens. The primary goals of the research were to investigate the ability of the larger 15.2 mm (0.6 in.) strand to reliably transfer its prestressing forces within a reasonable transfer length, and to evaluate the current design provisions for transfer lengths. Eight specimens were pretensioned with 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) diameter strands and 10 specimens were pretensioned with 15.2 mm (0.6 in.) strands. Experimental results indicate that the larger 15.2 mm (0.6 in.) diameter strands require longer transfer lengths and cause more distress than the smaller 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) strands. However, the tests indicate that 15.2 mm (0.6 in.) strands can be readily employed for pretensioned concrete structures. Additionally, the results demonstrate that current design practice estimating transfer lengths can lead to unsafe designs and that a more reliable expression for transfer lengths should be adopted.

AB - An experimental and analytical study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using grit-impregnated, epoxy-coated, prestressing strands (coated strands) and smooth surfaced, epoxy-coated, deformed, welded-wire-fabric in thin prestressed concrete (PC) subdeck panels and to determine the transfer lengths for 9.53-mm (3/8 in.) diameter, seven-wire, 1,860-MPa (270 ksi), low-relaxation, coated and bare (uncoated) strands. When coated strands are located at the middepth of a PC panel, the experimental testing revealed that a 76-mm (3 in.) minimum thickness was required to prevent concrete cracking when the strands were cut, that the amount of concrete side cover affected the uncoated-strand transfer lengths, and that a 152-mm (6 in.) strand spacing did not appear to affect the transfer lengths for either the coated or uncoated strands. The experimental and analytical investigations showed that the measured coated-strand transfer lengths were about one-half of those measured lengths for uncoated strands and that the American Concrete Institute (ACI) Building Code expression for strand transfer length overestimates the coated-strand transfer lengths and underestimates the uncoated-strand transfer lengths.

AB - This paper describes an investigation into the redistribution of moments in certain composite concrete beams. Seven two-span beams 6.2 m long were constructed and tested by means of applying two point loads at midspans. Each beam comprised two precast beams made continuous by a top flange cast “in situ.” Since the term “redistribution of moments” is normally used in two different meanings (in research papers or in codes of practice), the concept of degree of redistribution is explained. A brief bibliography review presents the main research advances in this subject, and the contradiction between the results is significant in some cases. The experimental program is presented as well as the geometric and material properties of the test beams. The main results obtained from tests are presented from zero loading up to failure. The ultimate loads obtained from the tests are compared with theoretical ones considering both plastic and elastic behavior. Conclusions from the results are presented.

AB - A series of laboratory-based experiments is described in which an electrical time domain reflectometry (ETDR) system is used to locate, identify, and size a number of different artificial voids and wet sections in ducts filled with sand and containing a variety of steel cables. The echo waveforms were digitized using an ETDR instrumentation system and the signals passed to a computer for storage and processing. Data analysis using simple regression techniques, in conjunction with simple transmission line theory, suggests that a system based on the same principles could be used to identify and size similar voids in posttensioning ducts used to carry prestressing cables in load-bearing concrete structures such as bridges, retaining walls, and load-bearing platforms. Although considerably more research into the usefulness of this technique is required, initial results suggest that ETDR sensors, incorporated into the ductwork at the construction phase, may lead to the development of self-monitoring or so-called smart structures.

AB - Understanding the strain-softening behavior of concrete provides an essential key for numerical modeling. The strain-softening response depends, among other influences, on the degree of lateral constraint. In this paper the behavior of concrete panels with constraint provided by lateral in-plane reinforcement subjected to uniaxial compression is studied. Two different concrete strengths (41 and 87 MPa) were investigated. Results given pertain to compressive strength, axial and lateral strain at the ultimate, the effect of reinforcement ratio and reinforcement spacing, and the influence of panel width and thickness. To minimize boundary constraint the panels were tested using a lubricant to reduce friction between loading platens and the specimen. A combined feedback signal of the applied force and the axial specimen displacement provided a stable postpeak response. An existing model is used for predicting complete stress-strain curves of plain and reinforced normal-strength panels.

AB - External confinement of concrete by means of high-strength fiber composites can significantly enhance its strength and ductility as well as result in large energy absorption capacity. The confinement mechanism may include fiber-wrapping of existing columns as a retrofitting measure or encasement of concrete in a fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) tube for new construction. Proper design of such hybrid columns, however, requires an accurate estimate of the performance enhancement. Current design methods use simple extension of the models developed for conventional reinforced concrete columns. Results from a series of uniaxial compression tests on concrete-filled FRP tubes are compared with the available confinement models in the literature. The present study indicates that these models generally result in overestimating the strength and unsafe design. The study also shows a unique characteristic of confinement with fiber composites in that, unlike steel, FRP curtails the dilation tendency of concrete, as it reverses the direction of volumetric strains. This paper provides a framework for better understanding of the behavior of fiber-wrapped or FRP-encased concrete columns.

AB - An experimental investigation was conducted to study the difference in strength and behavior of unfilled and filled blocks and prisms compressed in two orthogonal directions, normal and parallel, to unit bed face. In some codes and standards no consideration has been given to the way the prisms should be constructed, nor to the way the blocks or prisms should be loaded to meet situations where the acting external forces are applied in a direction parallel to the unit bed face. This paper recommends methods of determining the specified compressive strength of blockwork masonry, fm′, be used in the preceding and in strength design theory for masonry structures. The effects of using different grout mixes and mortar joint types on the samples' strength were also investigated. The results show that changing the mortar strengths have little influence on unfilled prisms strength compressed parallel to bed face compared to those compressed normal to bed face. The presence of grout significantly increased the filled prisms section capacity compared to unfilled prisms, but for the range of grout strengths used, the contribution of grout to the prisms section capacity was small.

AB - The tensile behavior of reinforced concrete and clay unit masonry was studied by conducting a series of 33 direct tension tests on instrumented specimens. The effect of the steel reinforcement ratio was the principal variable considered. Reinforcing steel bars varied from no. 4 to no. 11 bars, while masonry unit widths varied from 90 to 290 mm. The measured tensile stress-strain curve permitted determination of the decrease in the tension stiffening behavior as a function of the cracking strain. All specimens were strained to levels far in excess of those permitted by design codes without suffering tensile bar failure. Initial behavior was governed by elastic properties. After cracking, a rapid decrease in effective stiffness was observed with the stiffness reducing to that of the reinforcing steel at a strain of approximately four times the cracking strain. This observation is significantly different from that reported for reinforced concrete. Examination of the stress-strain curve after yield showed a very strong influence of the reinforcing ratio on the shape of the stress-strain curve with lower steel ratios resulting in decreased ductility.

AB - Experimental and analytical studies have been carried out to investigate the performance of masonry-infilled RC frames under in-plane lateral loadings. In this paper, the experimental results are concisely summarized, and a constitutive model is presented for the modeling of masonry mortar joints and cementitious interfaces in general. A smeared-crack finite element model is used to model the behavior of concrete in the RC frames and masonry units. It is shown that the finite element models are able to simulate the failure mechanisms exhibited by infilled frames including the crushing and cracking of the concrete frames and masonry panels, and the sliding and separation of the mortar joints. The lateral strength obtained with these models are in good agreement with those obtained from the tests.

AB - The hysteretic behavior of reinforced concrete elements depends in large measure on the interaction between reinforcing steel and concrete through bond. This paper presents a new finite element for reinforcing bars anchored in concrete. The novel aspect of the element is the use of force instead of displacement interpolation functions. The force interpolation functions satisfy equilibrium in a strict sense and ensure the numerical stability of the results, even in the presence of significant strength loss and softening, as might be the case for reinforcing bars with insufficient anchorage length. Another novel aspect of the element formulation is its implementation in a general purpose finite element analysis program that is based on the stiffness method of analysis. Correlation studies with available experimental data demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to simulate the bond deterioration and eventual pull-out of anchored reinforcing bars under severe inelastic excursions.

AB - In this paper, a stress-strain model of concrete that takes confinement effects into account is developed, based on the results of a series of compression loading tests of reinforced concrete column specimens. The specimens have circular, square, and wall-type cross sections, with various arrangements of hoop reinforcement so as to cover practical bridge column sections designed in Japan. Test results showed that three parameters—peak stress, strain at peak stress, and deteriorating rate—are significant factors for the stress-strain curve of confined concrete. These parameters were analyzed statistically based on test data and equations for estimating them were proposed. An equivalent confined section was also proposed to evaluate effect of cross ties in wall-type cross section. Test results were compared with both the proposed model and existing models. The comparison showed that the predicted stress-strain relation by the proposed model provides better agreement with the experimental results than existing models.

AB - The paper proposes an improved method of analysis of reinforced concrete columns in braced (no-sway) frames, which is suitable as a simple computer solution for design practice and is more realistic than the existing ACI and CEB methods. The elastic restraint provided by beams adjacent to columns is described by rotational springs. The inelastic behavior of concrete is defined by a uniaxial stress-strain curve with postpeak softening in compression and a zero strength in tension. Plasticity of reinforcement is also considered. The deflection curve is assumed to be a sine curve. The improvement consists in considering the wavelength as unknown and variable during loading. The problem is reduced to a system of seven nonlinear algebraic equations, which are easily solved for small increments of axial displacement by a standard library optimization algorithm. The convergence always occurs and is fast if the increments are small enough. The influence of various parameters on the load-deflection curve, the path in the diagram of axial load P versus moment M, and the failure envelope are studied. Various phenomena, such as the possibility of a concave P(M) path at constant load eccentricity, are explained. It is shown that the ACI approach is slightly conservative in most cases, although situations exist in which the ACI approach is either grossly overconservative or slightly unconservative.

AB - Concrete plasticity models for the analysis of reinforced-concrete (RC) members in plane stress are studied. The proposed plasticity model for reinforced concrete provides a unified approach combining plasticity theory and damage models. It addresses strength enhancement under multiaxial compression, and tensile cracking damage. The model uses multiple failure criteria for compressive crushing and tensile cracking. For tensile cracking behavior, rotating-crack and fixed-crack plasticity models are compared. As crushing failure criterion, the Drucker-Prager and von Mises models are used for comparison. The proposed model uses new and existing damage models for tension softening, tension stiffening, and compression softening due to tensile cracking. Finite-element analyses using the plasticity model are compared with existing experimental results. To verify the proposed crushing and cracking  plasticity models, the experiments have load capacities governed either by compressive crushing of concrete or by yielding of reinforcing steel. The advantages and disadvantages of rotating-crack and fixed-crack plasticity models are discussed.

AB - A numerical model has been developed to reproduce the punching failure in reinforced-concrete structures. It is characterized by an efficient triaxial strength criterion for concrete, a nonassociated flow rule reproducing the concrete dilatancy observed experimentally, and a cracking model accounting for the brittleness of concrete failure under various states of stress. The simulation of punching failure in a circular slab is successfully performed as the localized mode of failure—characterized by an inclined crack—is reproduced. It is shown that punching failure is initiated by the coalescence of microcracks inside the slab, followed by a crack propagation towards the corner of the slab-column intersection. A parametric analysis of the punching failure demonstrates that (1) punching failure is due to tensile failure of concrete along the inclined punching crack and is not due to compressive failure; (2) increasing the percentage of reinforcement reduces the state of internal cracking resulting in an increase of the failure load and a reduction of the ductility; and (3) the size effect observed experimentally is reproduced and a size-effect law is proposed.

AB - The behavior of composite concrete sections reinforced with conventional steel bars and steel fibers, and subjected to flexural cyclic loading beyond the yield point of steel bars, is analyzed by means of a mechanical model. The stress-strain relationships for the concrete, for the steel fiber, and for the steel bars are assumed to be piecewise linear. These constitutive laws are used to obtain the primary moment-curvature relationship of the section for a monotonically increasing load up to failure. On this basic curve, the successive stiffness degradation is created as a function of stress and strain levels reached in the section at each load cycle. Strain hardening of steel and the combined effect of confinement ensured by the stirrups and metal fibers are also taken into account. The numerical results, obtained at first for ordinary reinforced concrete sections, are compared with experimental results available in literature. Subsequently, the model is applied to study concrete sections reinforced with steel bars and steel fibers, subjected to a flexural cycle, with identical mechanical and geometrical specifications to the reinforced concrete sections. The equality of the maximum curvature reached to each load cycle for both kinds of sections is imposed, and comparisons are drawn in terms of energy dissipation.

AB - The firstand second-order stiffness matrices and load vector of a prismatic beam-column of double symmetrical cross section with semirigid end connections including the effects of end axial loads (tension or compression) and shear deformations are derived in a classical manner. The derived matrices can be used in the stability, firstand second-order elastic analyses of framed structures with rigid, semirigid, and simple connections. The classical stability functions are utilized in the stiffness matrix and in the load vector. The proposed stiffness matrices can also be utilized in the inelastic analysis of frames whose members suffer from flexural degradation or, on the contrary, stiffening at their end connections. The validity of both matrices is verified against available solutions of stability analysis and nonlinear geometric elastic analysis of framed structures. Three examples are included that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed matrices.

AB - A computer program has been produced to study numerically the instability of normaland high-strength reinforced concrete walls. This method of analysis requires the calculation of moment-curvature values, which are then used to accurately predict the maximum axial load a wall section can carry before failure occurs. The computer program is used to analyze a standard 150 mm-thick wall section to illustrate its advantages over simplified code methods. In particular, the computer program is used to investigate the effect of high-strength concrete on the load capacity of a wall section.

AB - One of the simplest approaches for optimizing statically loaded trusses is to handle stress constraints using the fully stressed design (FSD) technique. The displacement constraints are handled using the optimality criteria (OC) approach. Optimizing structural systems require regarding design variables as discrete quantities. The easiest approach is to consider the variables continuous and later approximate them to the immediate higher available discrete values. This procedure leads to nonoptimal designs. A modified approximation rule is suggested here. This rule leaves some displacement constraints violated, but a new technique based on 1-0 integer programming (IP) is developed to satisfy the displacement constraints. The proposed technique uses very few design variables. It is very efficient for designing trusses using available sections. Problems involving up to 1027 design variables have been solved efficiently with this approach.
