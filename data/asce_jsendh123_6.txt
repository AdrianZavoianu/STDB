AB - While the flanges of cold-formed hollow flange beams (HFBs) are very stiff torsionally, their webs are comparatively flexible, and may allow web distortion effects to reduce their resistances to lateral buckling. There is no simple formulation for predicting the effects of web distortion on the lateral buckling of HFBs. As a result, structural designers are unable either to check or to extend the available elastic buckling predictions; thus code writers are not able to provide explicit formulations for the effects of distortion. The conversion from elastic buckling to strength for HFBs is also questionable, since cold-formed beams have different stress-strain curves, residual stresses, and geometrical imperfections from those of hot-formed beams. This paper deals with these problems, first by finding a simple but sufficiently accurate closed-form solution for the effects of distortion on the elastic lateral buckling of simply supported HFBs in uniform bending, and then by developing an advanced theoretical method of predicting the effects of the stress-strain curve, residual stresses, and geometrical imperfections on the strengths of HFBs that fail by lateral-distortional buckling. Such a method allows the development of a conversion from elastic buckling to strength, which is appropriate for HFBs. The use of this conversion together with the simple approximation developed here for elastic lateral-distortional buckling provides a rational basis for the lateral buckling design of unbraced HFBs.

AB - The work presented in this paper was motivated by the collapse of an elevated conical shaped water tower structure in Fredericton, Canada, in December of 1990. It is analytically based and involves nonlinear stability analysis of liquid-filled conical steel vessels possessing geometric imperfections and residual stresses. A finite-element formulation based on a newly developed consistent shell element that includes both geometric and material nonlinearities is used. Elastic stability analyses of conical shells with different geometric imperfection patterns are undertaken, and the results indicate that the presence of axisymmetric imperfections leads to the lowest limit load for the structure. The sensitivity of the hydrostatically loaded conical vessels to geometric imperfections and residual stresses is investigated by considering inelastic analyses of three cases: (1) perfect vessels; (2) same as case 1, but with axisymmetric geometric imperfections of the order of the thickness of the shell; and (3) same as case 2, but with the addition of residual stresses due to welding. Results of these analyses indicate that liquid-filled conical shells are quite sensitive to geometric imperfections and that yielding precedes elastic buckling for tanks having practical dimensions.

AB - The behavior of steel columns submitted to axial compressive forces in case of fire is analyzed by means of numerical programs. Centrally loaded as well as eccentrically loaded columns are considered. A proposal is made for a buckling coefficient in case of central loading and for an interaction formula in case of eccentrical loading, based on the material properties of steel at elevated temperatures as defined in the 1995 Eurocode. The buckling coefficient comprises one scalar parameter that has to be calibrated by comparison with experimental results to ensure the appropriate safety level.

AB - The paper explores a general approach to the design of columns of metallic materials, notably aluminum and stainless steel. The stress-strain curves of these materials, and metallic materials in general, are nonlinear. In the paper, the stress-strain curves are assumed to be expressed as Ramberg-Osgood curves, defined in terms of the initial modulus (E0), the 0.2% proof stress (σ0.2) and the parameter n. It is shown that the column curve can be expressed in terms of the Ramberg-Osgood parameters by adopting a Perry curve as a basic strength curve and expressing the imperfection parameter in terms of E0, σ0.2, and n. The proposed strength curves are compared with column strengths obtained using advanced finite-element analyses of square hollow-section columns. For a wide range of material parameters, the mean of the ratio of finite-element strength to column strength is calculated using results for a range of column lengths and shown to lie between 0.98 and 1.04. The coefficient of variation of the same ratio is shown to be less than 0.025 indicating that the proposed strength curves are in good agreement with the finite-element strengths.

AB - Brittle fracture of structural steel members in buildings is generally triggered by a ductile crack initiated at a notched surface after undergoing a noticeable amount of plastic strain, as evidenced by structural damage in Kobe during the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake, as well as by large-scale fracture testing in laboratory. This study, based on fracture experiments and finite-element analyses, showed the conditions governing the initiation of such a ductile crack in conjunction with notch sharpness, material properties, and specimen size. Major findings are as follows. Ductile cracking is governed by three physical parameters, that is, averaged plastic strain in a notched section, peak stress triaxiality under the notch root, and uniform strain capacity pertinent to the material, in such a way that the strain at the onset of a ductile crack increases with the reduction in stress triaxiality and with the increase in uniform strain capacity. Their relations are established in an empirical formula. It is, furthermore, shown that size effect is not involved in the criterion for crack initiation.

AB - This paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) cyclic nonlinear finite-element model for concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) beam-columns and composite frame structures. This CFT beam finite element is incorporated into a matrix analysis program suitable for conducting monotonic static, cyclic static, or transient dynamic seismic analyses of complete composite unbraced frame structures composed of steel I-girders framing biaxially into CFT beam-columns. The material formulation consists of a concentrated plasticity bounding surface model in 3D stress-resultant (force) space. A polynomial expression developed in previous work to represent CFT cross-section strength is incorporated into this material model to represent the force-space yield surfaces. In addition, new formulations are present for isotropic and kinematic hardening of the loading and bounding surfaces to model strength degradation and stiffness deterioration of CFTs subjected to cyclic loading. Part II of this two-part paper presents the calibration and verification of the CFT element. This formulation is verified against a comprehensive set of experimental data and is accurate for a wide range of CFT cross-section sizes and material strengths.

AB - Part I of this two-part paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) cyclic nonlinear finite-element macromodel for concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) beam-columns and composite frame structures. The material formulation consists of a concentrated plasticity bounding surface model in 3D stress-resultant (force) space. Part II presents the calibration of the material model parameters based on comparison to both monotonic and cyclic experimental results of CFT beam-columns subjected to uniaxial and biaxial bending plus axial force. The macromodel is then verified against a comprehensive set of monotonic experiments, establishing its accuracy for a wide range of CFT cross-section sizes and material strengths. A final study compares this CFT finite element to an experiment consisting of a cyclically loaded 3D subassemblage composed of steel I-girders framing rigidly from three sides into a CFT beam-column. This CFT beam finite element is suitable for conducting monotonic static, cyclic static, or transient dynamic analysis of complete composite CFT unbraced frame structures, for executing seismic “push-over” analyses of composite CFT structures, and for conducting advanced inelastic analyses of composite CFT frames directly for design.

AB - A parametric study is presented of the ultimate strength of multiplanar KK-joints in circular hollow sections, which are commonly found in both onshore and offshore structures. The study was carried out using a well-calibrated and validated finite-element model, and the joints were subjected to antisymmetrical axial loading. In all, 40 joints were analyzed to investigate the effect of the various geometric parameters on static strength. Those joints that failed by chord bending can be divided into two groups: one with cracking occurring in the transverse gap region and the other with cracking occurring in the longitudinal gap region. This finding is in accord with experimental evidence from previous research. The finite-element data and the existing test and numerical data form a database on which multiple regression analysis was carried out. Two sets of strength equations were developed from the regression analysis: one provides correction functions that can be applied to an existing planar K-joint equation and the other relates the nondimensional strength directly to the geometric parameters. Both sets of equations were found to provide strength predictions to a very high degree of accuracy.

AB - This paper presents experimental results of 44 composite beam structures tested under static and fatigue loads. While designing the specimens, variables considered included: (1) the number of shear studs; (2) reinforcing method (deformed bars versus welded wire fabric); and (3) load levels and load ranges for fatigue tests. Results show that (1) cracks were initiated in the concrete slab; (2) propagation and connection of cracks led all specimens to fail; (3) the shear studs become stressed after formation of the cracks; (4) crushing of concrete near the shear studs was observed in some fatigue tests; and (5) the flexural stiffness of the specimens decreased through fatigue tests. The specimens containing wire mesh are superior to those containing steel bars. Moreover, no practical difference in structural behavior was found between the full composite and the 80% composite specimens.

AB - Beams with corrugated webs were tested to failure under uniform bending. The failure was sudden and due to vertical buckling of the compression flange into the web after the stress in the flange reached the yield stress. The test results indicate that the web offered a negligible contribution to the moment carrying capacity of the beam. The test specimens were modeled using finite elements and the computer program ABAQUS was used to perform nonlinear analysis. The finite element model was able to depict the test results to a very good degree of accuracy. Parametric analytical studies were conducted to examine the effect of the ratio between the flange and web thicknesses and yield stresses, the corrugation configuration, the panel aspect ratio, and the stress-strain relationship. Based on these studies, it was concluded that, for design, the ultimate moment capacity can be calculated based on the flange yielding ignoring any contribution from the web.

AB - Beams with corrugated webs were tested to failure under partial compressive edge loading. The failure was due to a flange collapse mechanism and web crippling or web yielding, followed by crippling and vertical bending of the flange into the crippled web. The test specimens were analyzed using finite-element models, and the correlation between the analytical and experimental results was very good. Parametric studies were conducted using finite-element models, and simple design equations were developed. The effect of the presence of in-plane bending or shear on the capacity under patch loading was examined analytically, and design recommendations were made.

AB - The stability equations for plane frames with prismatic columns according to the buckling mode (as sidesway inhibited, partially inhibited, and uninhibited frames) are derived in a classical manner. In addition, an approach that evaluates the effective length K-factor, the critical axial load, and the sway-magnification factor δs for an entire story in plane framed structures is presented. The three-way frame classification and the proposed corresponding stability equations overcome the paradoxes of the current two-way classification of “braced” and “unbraced” frames. Moreover, the proposed equations are applicable to the stability analyses of multistory multibay plane frames with rigid, semirigid, and simple connections. It is shown that the stability equation of frames with sidesway partially inhibited has been the “missing link” to a full understanding of the elastic stability behavior of frames, and is the key to solving the paradoxes of current methods. Four detailed examples are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method and the complete classical stability equations for plane framed structures.

AB - An elastoplastic analysis of rotationally symmetric reinforced concrete plates resting on elastoplastic subgrade under column load is presented. The plates are made of an elastic, perfectly plastic material that obeys the Johansen's yield condition and the associated flow rule. The analysis is simplified by assuming that any plate element is either entirely elastic or entirely plastic. This assumption is practically fulfilled for a sandwich plate. Differential equations that describe the behavior of plastic zones during the deformation process are derived and solved in closed forms. Interaction between the plate and the foundation is investigated. Dimensionless load-moment relations for different plate parameters are shown in figures. Examples of solutions are given.

AB - A live-load survey was carried out on several building offices in Mexico City. The results are used to estimate the probability distribution function of the maximum total loads for different influence areas over a 50-year return period. The mean values of these loads are compared with the specifications of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and with those of the Federal District Mexican Building Code. The probabilities of exceedance of nominal values recommended in these codes are drastically different. The results of this study serve to propose a new load-reducing rule for the Mexican code.

AB - This paper proposes a method to describe the stress, strain, and deflection behavior of reinforced concrete beams. The role of compression reinforcement is included via an enhanced rational approach and an iterative technique that are designed to converge quickly, normally within two to three cycles. Creep deflections are computed by applying a direct procedure similar to that currently used by ACI318-95 to calculate immediate deflections. The regular routine of computing deflections is thus basically preserved. A slight modification is only needed to model concrete and section properties under sustained service load. The results of the creep model are superposed with those from a shrinkage model, and the combined effect is found to well represent the actual time-dependent deflections. Beams with high compression steel ratios are particularly shown to yield calculated results in good correlation with experimental results. This represents an improvement in the ACI318-95 building code procedure, which is known to exaggerate the role of compression steel in reducing deflections, particularly for lightly reinforced beams with high compression to tension steel ratios. For the examined cases it was determined that the calculated deflections using the proposed method are 9% less to 12% more than the measured values.

AB - Unlike other building materials, dimension lumber is available only in a very limited number of sizes. Typical low-rise building construction uses common “two-by” lumber ranging in size from nominal 2 × 4 to 2 × 12 (38 × 89 to 38 × 296 mm). The implications of sizing up to the next available discrete lumber size on the reliability of wood members in flexure are reported in this paper. Consideration is given to both strength and deflection serviceability limit states and the new load and resistance factor design (LRFD) specification for wood construction.

AB - It is well known that wood exhibits continued additional creep deflection under long-term load. Differential creep behavior among joists, sheathing material, and connection details in a wood joist floor system can affect the system performance of the assembly over time. For example, if the flexural stiffness of the partial composite T-sections consisting of wood joists and sheathing changes continuously over time, the deflection response of the wood assembly would obviously be affected. The objective of this research was to investigate the time-dependent behavior of wood floor systems within the service-load range as defined by time-dependent deflection behavior and time-dependent load-distribution behavior. The specific focus of this paper is on experimental tests and observations.
