AB - Metal angle sections, singly or in combination, acting as concentric or eccentric columns, beams, or beam-columns, may buckle in flexure or torsion, or combinations thereof. The behavior of such structural elements is discussed, and simplified design formulas using a uniform treatment are suggested. The use of normalized slendernesses for all modes of buckling, with a normalized buckling curve, is described. Local buckling and torsional buckling are differentiated and the special cases in which local buckling can occur are identified. Single and double angles acting as concentrically and eccentrically loaded columns, and as beams with combined moments are treated. Failure modes are overall buckling in columns, beams, and beam-columns, and yielding or local buckling at the extreme fibers of beams and beam-columns.

AB - The paper describes a design procedure for stainless-steel columns failing by flexural buckling. In the approach, the stress-strain curve is assumed to be expressed as a Ramberg-Osgood curve, defined in terms of the initial modulus (E0), the 0.2% proof stress (σ0.2), and the parameter n. It is shown that the column curve can be described in terms of the Ramberg-Osgood parameters by adopting a Perry curve as the basic strength curve, and expressing the imperfection parameter in terms of E0, σ0.2, and n. By using a Perry curve, the design procedure is explicit. This contrasts with the iterative approach described in the ASCE load and resistance factor design (LRFD) specification for the design of cold-formed stainless steel structural members. The proposed strength curves are compared with those from tests on stainless steel columns. It is shown that the coefficient of variation of the ratio of test strength to design strength is lower using the proposed design approach than when using the ASCE specification; thus, the proposed approach is more accurate than that described in the ASCE specification. It is also more efficient because it is explicit. Using the comparison with test results, the resistance factor to be used with the proposed design procedure is derived.

AB - Cyclic tension and compression testing has revealed that cracking behavior in structural steel subjected to plastic strain reversals is transitional from a fatigue to a ductile mode with the elevation of strain amplitude. The transition can be identified by the plastic strain accumulation pattern, the fractographic appearance, the crack penetrating profile, and the convex feature of the Manson-Coffin's curve. Since the strain amplitude induced by a severe earthquake is large enough to cause a crack in a few or several cycles of plastic strain, the crack is not a fatigue crack, but a ductile crack. Thus, the crack onset under cyclic seismic overloading can be predicted from the crack initiation strain under monotonic tensile testing. Because the monotonic tensile test is easily carried out in practice, it can be used to qualify steels and welds for seismic applications.

AB - This paper describes an analytical study to investigate the behavior of subassemblages with a range of semirigid connections under different test conditions and loading arrangements. The αpin concept, which gives an indication of the benefit of the restraint from the beam-to-column connection after incorporating the potentially disadvantageous influence of moment through the connection, is validated. It is noted that the M-ϕ response is of fundamental importance and the success or failure of semirigid design methods rests on it. However, it is the most difficult parameter to determine accurately. The results in this study have shown that significant variations of the M-ϕ response have a negligible effect on the load carrying of the column and the behavior of the subassemblage. This implies the precise form of the M-ϕ response is not important for the column capacity of braced frames. Due to the boundary condition of the model, these results only translate into the braced frame behavior.

AB - Optimization of large structures consisting of thousands of members subjected to the highly nonlinear constraints of the actual commonly used design codes, such as the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC), Allowable Stress Design (ASD), or Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) specifications (AISC 1989, 1994), requires high-performance computing resources. We have previously developed parallel optimization algorithms on shared memory multiprocessors where a few powerful processors are connected to a single shared memory. In contrast, in a distributed memory machine, a relatively large number of microprocessors are connected to their own locally distributed memories without globally shared memory. In this article, we present distributed nonlinear neural dynamics algorithms for discrete optimization of large steel structures. The algorithms are implemented on a recently introduced distributed memory machine, the CRAY T3D, and applied to the minimum weight design of three large space steel structures ranging in size from 1,310 to 8,904 members. The stability, convergence, and efficiency of the algorithms are demonstrated through examples. For an 8,904-member structure, a high parallel processing efficiency of 94% is achieved using a 32-processor configuration.

AB - Conventional design does not exclude risk of local damage to a structure due to accidental events. Safety of the structure can be improved by ensuring that failure of any of its components does not cause, within an appropriate level of reliability, collapse of the whole structure or a major part of it. In this paper reliability of multistory framed structures subjected to column failure is investigated using a probabilistic method. The method is based on a combination of a nonlinear finite-element structural model and a first-order reliability method. Uncertainties in material properties, geometry, loads, and the structural model itself are taken into account, and their influence on frame reliability is considered. The uncertain parameters appropriate to the strength of reinforcing steel, live load, and the model uncertainty are found to have a major influence on the frame reliability. For three-span frames with different numbers of stories and span-length ratios, critical cases of column failures are identified. As a result it is possible to restrict the number of examined structures. Finally, a simplified probabilistic method is proposed for the reliability assessment of damaged frame structures.

AB - The conditional probability of failure of a structure, given that it has already survived for T years, shows that structural reliability increases for service proven structures. Further, construction loads act essentially as proof loads, and so provide a means to detect the presence of gross construction errors. The present paper investigates the effect of construction error, proof load tests prior to occupation, realistic construction loads, and dead loads and office floor live loads on the probability of failure of service proven structures. The human reliability analysis (HRA) approach is used to simulate the effects of construction error. Results obtained from a Monte-Carlo computer simulation analysis showed that up to 50% of failures will occur during construction for reinforced-concrete beams constructed without engineering inspections. This suggests that construction loads act essentially as proof loads; hence, for structures with low live-to-dead load ratios the adverse consequences of construction error will most likely become evident during construction. Nevertheless, engineering inspections is a more effective error control measure.

AB - The results of an experimental and analytical study of the behavior of damaged or understrength concrete beams retrofitted with thin carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) sheets are presented. The CFRP sheets are epoxy bonded to the tension face and web of concrete beams to enhance their flexural and shear strengths. The effect of CFRP sheets on strength and stiffness of the beams is considered for various orientations of the fibers with respect to the axis of the beam. Nineteen beams were fabricated, loaded beyond concrete cracking strength, and retrofitted with three different CFRP systems. The beams were subsequently loaded to failure. Different modes of failure and gain in the ultimate strength were observed, depending on the orientation of the fibers.

AB - This paper presents a test program on full-scale reinforced slender shear connected cavity walls subjected to an eccentric compressive loading. A total of nine walls were tested. All specimens were constructed with a partially grouted and reinforced, 190-mm concrete masonry block wythe and a 90-mm burnt clay brick wythe. All had a slenderness ratio of height to backup wythe thickness of 27.8 and, except for one specimen, all walls had a 75-mm wide cavity. The primary variable, was the axial force eccentricity. The eccentricity varied both in magnitude from t/2 to t/3, and in direction, either towards or away from the brick wythe. Some walls were tested with a single curvature, others were tested in double curvature. The load-displacement response, failure mode, and ultimate load capacities are examined and reported along with the observation and discussion.

AB - Many buildings have been constructed with structural clay tile masonry as either infills, bearing walls, or partitions. Little data are available on the strength and constitutive properties of structural clay tile. The limited historical data and the results of some recent testing of structural clay tile prisms are presented. The current program tested side constructed prisms, or prisms with horizontal cells. Testing was performed at various angles to the bed joint. For loading perpendicular to the bed joint, the prism strength can be conservatively estimated as three-tenths of the unit tile strength. A linear relationship between the modulus of elasticity and the prism strength was also developed. Prisms loaded perpendicular to the bed joint exhibited an abrupt brittle failure, with the strain at peak load averaging 0.0014.

AB - A method for identifying the element properties of a truss is developed in this paper. The axial strains of the truss elements measured in static tests are used in the identification process. The finite-element method is used to derive the equilibrium equation of the truss. The identification problem is then formulated as an optimization program in which the error norm of the equilibrium equation is minimized. It is shown that given sufficient test data the element properties can be directly attained without iterations. Furthermore, the solution is unique and globally minimal. The proposed method can be applied to total truss identification as well as substructure identification. The identifiability of the inverse problem is then studied in depth. The perturbation method is adopted to investigate the influence of measurement errors on the identification results. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the proposed method. Finally, a model test is performed to examine the effectiveness of the method in real applications.

AB - The long-term laboratory tests on wood-based stressed-skin panels (SSP) of mixed construction were conducted in a controlled climate [20°C, 65% relative humidity (RH)] under a constant load. The purpose was to compare the measured results with theoretical predictions and to illustrate the principle of different degrees of creep in component parts and joints involving partial composite action. The elastic solution for a panel with partial composite action was adapted to creep conditions by using an effective modulus of elasticity for all the component parts and joints. The elastic modulus was reduced for each specific time to obtain the effective modulus of elasticity by using a simple creep model, namely a “power function.” The predictions of the long-term behavior using this simple method appeared to be very good. After being verified with the measured results, the model was then used for analyses of the sensitivity of creep in various component parts and joints in an entire SSP.

AB - A procedure for the design of controllers for tall buildings under wind loads is presented. It is assumed that there are constraints on the design, in terms of requiring that the root-mean square (RMS) values of certain displacements, velocities, or accelerations be within prescribed values. In addition, there are constraints on the RMS control force available. Under these conditions, the synthesis of a stabilizing controller is investigated. The solution process involves posing the search for a controller as a problem of constrained optimization for which the Lagrange multipliers are determined by an ellipsoid algorithm. These multipliers are directly related to the weights in the objective function of an associated Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) optimal control problem. Thus the design problem may be seen to be one of optimal weight selection in the LQG setting. Two examples of tall buildings under wind loads, involving the design of active tuned mass dampers, are considered to illustrate the design process and to assess the performance of the controllers. Results on the performance of the designs and the control effectiveness are presented and discussed. The generality of the current procedure enables it to be applied directly to other kinds of structures like bridges, shell-like domes, cooling towers, tall chimneys, under earthquake or wind loads, and using either active mass dampers, active tendon control, or other technqiues as appropriate.

AB - A new design model is presented to derive expressions for the elastic effective length factors for columns in unbraced multistory frames. This model takes into account the effects of boundary conditions at the far ends of the columns above and below the column in question. According to the relative bending stiffness of the girders and columns framing at the far ends, the far end conditions can be modeled as rigid, hinged, or fixed. Because the alignment chart model is based on rigid-far-end conditions, it is not applicable in designing columns with either hinged or fixed-far-end conditions. This refined model rectifies inherent problems associated with currently available solutions caused by both the invalid assumption of constant story drift angles and the errors in mathematical formulation. Using the background of extensive numerical studies, a modified design procedure based on the alignment chart is suggested. The proposed design procedure is characterized by both simplicity and accuracy.

AB - In recent years nonlinear dynamic analysis of three-dimensional structural models is used more and more in the assessment of existing structures in zones of high seismic risk and in the development of appropriate retrofit strategies. In this framework beam finite-element models of various degrees of sophistication are used in the description of the hysteretic behavior of structural components under a predominantly uniaxial state of strain and stress. These models are commonly derived with the displacement method of analysis, but recent studies have highlighted the benefits of frame models that are based on force interpolation functions (flexibility approach). These benefits derive from the fact that models with force interpolation functions that reproduce the variation of internal element forces in a strict sense yield the exact solution of the governing equations in the absence of geometric nonlinearity. While the numerical implementation of force-based models at first appears cumbersome, simple examples of nonlinear analysis in this paper offer conclusive proof of the numerical and computational superiority of these models on account of the smaller number of model degrees of freedom for the same degree of accuracy in the global and local response. A numerical implementation that bypasses the iterative nature of the element state determination in recent force-based elements is also introduced, thus further expanding the benefits of flexibility-based nonlinear frame models.

AB - In this technical note, a finite-element solution of a simply supported beam with variable arc length under a point load is presented. The beam is hinged at one end and simply supported over the other end. The distance between the two supports is the span length. A point load is applied at various locations along the span of the beam. The finite-element method based on the variational formulation, which involves the bending strain energy, work done by the point load, and the strain energy due to axial forces in beam, is used to solve the problem. Because of the unknown total arc length, the finite-element discretization is made along the span length rather than the total arc length. For a given value of the point load, two possible equilibrium configurations exist, of which one is stable and the other is unstable. For the stable configuration, the finite-element solution gives results that are in good agreement with the results obtained using the elliptic-integral method and the shooting-optimization technique.

AB - This technical note describes a computer program written to generate the member stiffness matrix for geometrically nonlinear space frames using the equations of three-dimensional (3D) beam-columns without cross-sectional warping. (The 3D beam-column equations simply extend what is commonly done in two-dimensional (2D) beam-columns to beams in space where there now exist many unexplored, coupled buckling phenomena.) A power series approach is used to solve these equations.
