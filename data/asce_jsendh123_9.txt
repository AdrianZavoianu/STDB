AB - A new cold-formed and resistance-welded section known as the hollow flange beam (HFB) has been developed recently in Australia. In contrast to the common lateral-torsional buckling mode of I-beams, this unique section comprising two stiff triangular flanges and a slender web is susceptible to a lateral-distortional buckling mode of failure involving lateral deflection, twist, and cross-section change due to web distortion. This lateral-distortional buckling behavior has been shown to cause significant reduction of the available flexural capacity of HFBs. An investigation using finite-element analyses and large-scale experiments was carried out into the use of transverse web plate stiffeners to improve the lateral buckling capacity of HFBs. This paper presents the details of the finite-element model and analytical results. The experimental procedure and results are outlined in a companion paper.

AB - The hollow flange beam (HFB) is a new cold-formed and resistance-welded section developed in Australia. Due to its unique geometry comprising two stiff triangular flanges and a slender web, the HFB is susceptible to a lateral-distortional buckling mode of failure involving web distortion. Investigation using finite-element analyses showed that the use of transverse web plate stiffeners effectively eliminated lateral-distortional buckling of HFBs and thus any associated reduction in flexural capacity. A detailed experimental investigation was then carried out to validate the results from the finite-element analysis and to improve the stiffener configuration further. This led to the development of a special stiffener that is screw-fastened to the flanges on alternate sides of the web. This paper presents the details of the experimental investigation, the results, and the final stiffener arrangement whereas the details of the finite-element analyses are presented in a companion paper.

AB - The development and accuracy of an appropriate analytical model to predict the behavior of cold-formed steel (CFS) structural members necessitate a correct representation of the corresponding material characteristics. The results of two series of experimental investigations to evaluate the mechanical properties and the built-in residual stresses of CFS sections are reported in this paper. These investigations were performed on channel-shaped CFS sections manufactured using the cold-roll forming technique. Tensile coupon tests were used to evaluate the mechanical properties at different locations such as flat area, and the corner areas, of the channel sections. Electrical resistance strain gauges with an “electrical discharge machining” cutting technique were used to establish the magnitudes and the distributions of residual stresses within the channel sections. Based on the experimental results, appropriate analysis models for the stress-strain relationship, the variation of the yield strength, and the residual stresses in CFS channel sections have been established. The proposed analysis models for material properties have been incorporated within a large deformation shell finite element to form an analysis model for CFS sections. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed material properties models have been evaluated by comparing the finite-element analysis results against corresponding experimental results of CFS sections subjected to axial compressive loads.

AB - Steel angles acting in tension can be used singly or in pairs. In either case, it is not usually possible to connect both legs. This means that the effectiveness of the member must reflect the shear lag that is present in such an arrangement. This study reports on the experimental testing of 24 single and double angle tension members that use bolted end connections. This experimental work is supplemented by that of others and by an analytical investigation. Design recommendations are made that differ in some significant ways from design rules currently used.

AB - A simplified approach to evaluate creep and shrinkage effects in a steel-concrete composite beam with rigid or deformable connections, based on the age-adjusted effective modulus method, is presented. An aging coefficient, χ, evaluated in the absence of connection is adopted and exactly characterized by a theoretical point of view. Simplified expressions to evaluate χ and an easy to use, closed-form solution in the hypothesis of rigid connections and uncracked concrete are proposed. Numerical comparisons show how the proposed approach provides accurate results independently of the connection stiffness and load condition, and how it can substitute appropriately the more popular effective modulus method.

AB - This paper reports the experimental test results of four small-scale concrete-encased I-shape steel columns subjected to biaxial bending moments and axial compressive load in single curvature. The composite column specimens, one short and three slender, had a square cross section. The effects of the eccentrically applied axial compressive force, slenderness of the cross section, different material properties of concrete and steel, and load-deflection and moment-curvature behavior on the maximum load capacity of a composite column were examined. The test results were compared with the analytical results of the maximum load capacity obtained from a numerical analysis. The numerical analysis uses the finite differences method to establish the relationship between curvature and deflection. A computer program to perform the numerical analysis is used for the case of composite columns. The comparative results indicate that the analytical method and computer program used to model and analyze the composite column specimens can accurately predict the maximum load capacity and deformation behavior of a pinned-ended biaxially loaded concrete-encased steel column with axial compressive load in single curvature.

AB - Finite-element buckling analyses of singly symmetric I-shaped girders subjected to transverse loading applied at different heights on the cross section were conducted. Single-curvature and reverse-curvature bending were considered. Moment gradient factors based on the finite-element results were calculated and compared with traditional values used to predict the buckling capacity of I-shaped doubly symmetric sections. The results from the computational study show that, for many cases, traditional moment gradient factors can be used for singly symmetric girders if effects of load height are measured relative to midheight of the cross section. Solutions for load-height effects are presented for singly symmetric I-sections.

AB - It is well known that a central elastic torsional restraint restricts the lateral buckling shape of an elastic I-beam and increases the elastic flexural-torsional buckling moment. However, the effect of torsional restraints on inelastic buckling has not been studied, and it is not known whether the limiting stiffness for elastic buckling can be applied to beams that buckle inelastically. This paper develops a finite-element model for the inelastic nonlinear flexural-torsional analysis of steel I-beams and uses it to investigate the effects of central elastic torsional restraints on the inelastic flexural-torsional buckling of steel I-beams. It is found that a central elastic torsional restraint increases the inelastic strength of the beam, but that the increase in the inelastic strength decreases as the beam's modified slenderness decreases. The limiting value of the stiffness of a central elastic torsional restraint at which the inelastic strength of the beam is equal to that of the corresponding beam with a rigid restraint is related to the modified slenderness of the beam. For a beam with a low modified slenderness that buckles inelastically the limiting restraint stiffness is much smaller than that for a beam that buckles elastically. For slender beams the moment transferred by a central torsional restraint of the limiting stiffness exceeds the strength design requirement for the restraint implied by Standards Australia's AS4100 as a result of excessive central twist rotation.

AB - In certain types of steel framed structures members can be subjected to significant distributed axial as well as lateral loads along their lengths. The behavior of the member is complicated by the nonlinear interaction between the member force and the member stiffness. The conventional assumption of lumping loads to the member ends can lead to inaccurate results. This paper addresses the second-order analysis of frames with members subjected to gravitational axial loads. The error associated with lumping of distributed loads at the members ends is shown to be nontrivial in certain cases. In most design codes axial loads are assumed to be nodal and do not vary along the member length. Also, the result of previous studies on second-order frame analysis ignores this influence and, therefore, their solutions are only approximate and may be incorrect. The derived element improves the accuracy and widens the scope of application for a computer program based on the concept of “second-order analysis,” the “advanced analysis,” and the proposed “integrated analysis and design approach,” which carries out an analysis simultaneously with design meeting the design code requirements. This proposed approach differs from other available methods for advanced analysis in its simplicity and capability of meeting the current and the widely used design code philosophy based on the first-plastic-hinge concept.

AB - Stability criteria that evaluate the elastic critical axial load of beam-columns with flexural connections under the combination of conservative end axial forces are presented in a classical manner. The end axial loads include gravity loads combined with forces such as those produced by tension cables that always pass through fixed points or forces applied by rigid links. The proposed method follows the same format and classification of beam-columns and frames under gravity loads. The derived equations that can be applied to the stability analysis of beam-columns in structural and mechanical systems with rigid, semirigid, and hinged end connections overcome the limitations of current methods of stability analysis (such as the well-known alignment charts for braced and unbraced columns and frames under gravity loads). Several examples are presented in detail that demonstrate the effects of compressive forces applied by prestressed cables or rigid links combined with gravity loads on the overall stability of frames and the effectiveness of the proposed stability equations.

AB - The vertical deflections perpendicular to the plane of a horizontal beam curved in plan are coupled with its twist rotations, and its axial deflections are coupled with its horizontal radial deflections. Because of the first of these couplings, a horizontally curved beam subjected to vertical loading has both primary bending and torsion actions. In the nonlinear range, second-order couplings between the vertical and horizontal deflections and the twist rotations are developed, and the nonlinear behavior of the curved beam becomes more complicated. This paper studies the linear, neutral, and nonlinear equilibrium of elastic horizontally curved I-beams under vertical loading and develops a curved finite-element model for their analysis. It is found that when the included angle of a curved beam is small, the primary coupling is also small and bending is the major action. In this case, the nonlinear behavior is similar to the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of a straight beam. However, if the included angle of the curved beam is not small, the primary coupling becomes significant and both torsion and bending are major actions. In this case, nonlinear behavior develops very early and is quite different from the flexural-torsional buckling behavior of a straight beam.

AB - The paper is intended to present a numerical and experimental study on the local-overall interactive buckling behavior and ultimate load of I-section steel columns. The numerical method, named the finite strip plasticity coefficient increment initial stress method, is proposed to trace up the interactive buckling ultimate load-carrying capacity of thin-walled plate structures involved in elastic-plastic and large deflection. The detailed solution procedures based on the amended Newton-Raphson iteration technique are presented. The structure discretization degree is reduced by the finite strip method and the computing quantity of elastic plasticity is significantly decreased by means of the section plasticity coefficient concept. Parameters such as column slenderness, web and flange plate width-thickness ratio, welded residual stress, and load eccentricity are considered in this paper. The experimental results of 11 welded I-section steel columns with relatively large plate width-thickness ratio have been found to agree reasonably with the numerical predictions. The results have shown that the column failure brought about by local buckling, overall buckling, or local-overall interactive buckling, and the local buckling of component plates does not mean a complete loss of the load-carrying capacity of the column at once.

AB - Braced metallic tubes are used to dissipate kinetic energy in impact attenuation devices used in transportation safety applications. It is an experimentally observed fact that these braced tubes collapse asymmetrically, even under symmetrical loading conditions. This paper examines the energy dissipation characteristics of such a tube when braced across its diameter and subjected to lateral plate loading conditions. Upperand lower-bound limit analysis approaches are used to first determine the initial asymmetric collapse load of the tube with diametrical bracing oriented perpendicular to the line of action of the loads. Then, the equivalent structure technique (EST) and finite-element program, ABAQUS, are used to determine the postcollapse characteristics of the tube. Finally, these mathematical and numerical model predictions are compared with experimental results to demonstrate the accuracy of the modeling process.

AB - Members of a plane-frame structure may be subjected to a combination of lateral loads, end moments, and axial forces. Analysis of such a structure may be classified as elementary, first-order or second-order, depending on the load conditions, magnitude of displacements, and method of solution. A numerical procedure is presented in this paper for the solution of geometrically nonlinear problems considering second-order effects. After a brief literature review, the paper presents the assumptions pertinent to the research; the relationship between the engineering strain and Green strain tensor considering small strain and moderate to large rotations; finite-element consideration in the derivation of the incremental stiffness matrices using increments of total potential energy and the concepts of a variational method; a procedure for the solution of the nonlinear problems and its algorithm; numerical examples and comparison of the numerical results with published literature; and conclusions and results. The algorithm that is presented in this paper is useful in identifying the differences between the firstand second-order analysis of structural systems.

AB - A numerical procedure for structural analysis of bored piles is proposed that uses the composite filamented beam element. The beam stiffness about the reference axes is obtained by summing the contributions from all the concrete filaments and all the embedded reinforcements. Once the concrete has cracked at a filament, its effect on pile stiffness is neglected. This models the variation of stiffness beyond cracking loads. Soil loads on the pile are modeled by nonlinear soil springs. These springs use a modified Ramberg-Osgood model to represent the lateral response and hyperbolic function to represent axial and torsional behaviors. Before cracking, the concrete is modeled as a nonlinear elastic material. The pile postcracking torsional stiffness is also considered. The steel reinforcing bars are modeled as elastic-plastic axially loaded elements. Three numerical examples are presented to study the validity and applicability of the present method. The results obtained are compared with experimental and/or analytical work by other investigators.

AB - This paper presents a study on the structural modeling and analysis of modular falsework systems. The structural model of a two-story door-type modular falsework system is developed based on the observed behavior of full-scale tests. The effects of initial imperfections, connection stiffness, and boundary conditions are investigated. The use of simplified two-dimensional models for analyzing three-dimensional falsework assemblies is examined. The paper discusses the slippage of wooden shores as a possible cause of failure. The study concludes that the use of shoring extensions as the most significant factor that reduces the load-carrying capacity of modular falsework systems.

AB - This paper presents a constrained multiobjective (multicriterion, vector) optimization methodology by integrating a Pareto genetic algorithm (GA) and a fuzzy penalty function method. A Pareto GA generates a Pareto optimal subset from which a robust and compromise design can be selected. This Pareto GA consists of five basic operators: reproduction, crossover, mutation, niche, and the Pareto-set filter. The niche and the Pareto-set filter are defined, and fitness for a multiobjective optimization problem is constructed. A fuzzy-logic penalty function method is developed with a combination of deterministic, probabilistic, and vague environments that are consistent with GA operation theory based on randomness and probability. Using this penalty function method, a constrained multiobjective optimization problem is transformed into an unconstrained one. The functions of a point (string, individual) thus transformed contain information on a point's status (feasible or infeasible), position in a search space, and distance from a Pareto optimal set. Sample cases investigated in this work include a multiobjective integrated structural and control design of a truss, a 72-bar space truss with two criteria, and a four-bar truss with three criteria. Numerical experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly efficient and robust.

AB - The main objective of this study is to assess the structural integrity of the double-deck through-truss Brent-Spence bridge when subjected to a seismic event from the New Madrid, Wabash Valley, or Anna seismic zones. To achieve this, the scope of work was divided into several tasks as follows: field testing of the main bridge, analytical modeling, determination of the site-specific ground motion, and seismic response analysis. This paper deals with the first two tasks. The ambient vibration properties of the main bridge were determined through field testing under traffic induced excitation. The purpose of measuring the ambient vibration properties was to determine the mode shapes and the associated natural frequencies. These vibration properties were subsequently used as the basis for calibrating the finite-element model for seismic response analysis. A three-dimensional finite-element model of the main bridge was developed for the free vibration analysis. The seismic response analysis using this calibrated finite-element model is presented in the second part of this two-part paper.

AB - This is the second part of a two-part paper on field testing and analytical studies related to seismic behavior of the Brent-Spence bridge. This part of the paper deals with seismic evaluation of the bridge, while the first part dealt with free and ambient vibration studies of the bridge by field testing and finite-element analysis. Site-specific ground motion scenarios are developed for the bridge to represent probable earthquakes that may occur in these seismic zones. The time histories of these events are then used in the seismic analysis of the main bridge and response spectra are used for analyzing the approach spans. A three-dimensional finite-element model of the main bridge was subjected to the time histories to determine maximum responses (displacements, forces, and stresses). The seismic analysis of approach spans dealt only with the potential for loss of span due to excessive longitudinal displacement along the highway main line. For the maximum credible earthquake of magnitude 8.5 Ms (7.3 mb,Lg) on the Richter scale at New Madrid, the seismic evaluation indicates that the main bridge will survive the earthquake in the elastic range without significant damage and no loss of span. The approach spans are found to be vulnerable to loss of span failure in the 8.5 Ms event.
