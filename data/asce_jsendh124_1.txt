AB - Reinforced concrete structures deteriorate over time due to environmental aging, fatigue, and other reasons. Strengthening and rehabilitating those concrete structures by wrapping them with carbon fabric is one of several economical engineering solutions. The intent of this study is to evaluate the increase in flexural strength of reinforced concrete beams after wrapping them with carbon fabrics. In this study, 24 reinforced concrete beams strengthened with carbon fiber wraps were experimentally evaluated to determine improvements in flexural strength. In addition, bending test results from the wrapped beams were compared with those of other identical concrete beams strengthened with bonded steel plates. Four different carbon wrap configurations were used for strengthening beams and for evaluation and comparison of experimental data. Static responses of all the concrete beams were evaluated in terms of strength, stiffness, compositeness between wrap and concrete, and associated failure modes. Factors governing the percentage increase in the ultimate strength are discussed. Wrapped beams were analyzed considering conventional force equilibrium equations and compared with the experimental results.

AB - The fatigue response of concrete decks reinforced with fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) bars is critical to the long-term endurance of this type of innovative structure. To evaluate the degradation of FRP reinforced bridge decks, fatigue tests were conducted on four concrete deck steel stringers. An initial stress range of 2.27 MPa (0.33 ksi) (tension) in the main FRP reinforcement, 3.1 MPa (0.45 ksi) (compressive) in the concrete deck top, and 24.8 MPa (3.6 ksi) (tension) at the bottom flange of a steel stringer was applied for all specimens. The stringer stiffness, composite versus noncomposite casting, and transverse posttensioning using high-strength Dywidag steel rods were varied during this research. The fatigue test results showed no loss of bond between FRP rebars and concrete in any of the test specimens. The major crack patterns were in the direction parallel to the stringers, i.e., flexural cracks in the concrete deck spanning the steel stringers. Effective central deck deflections could be set as a measure of global deck degradation during fatigue, and this rate of degradation in decks reinforced with FRP rebars was found comparable to decks reinforced with steel rebars.

AB - The behavior of filled masonry arch bridges under truck loading is examined by service load testing and by developing a finite-element model of a unit width of the structure. The field tests included five structures varying in span from 3 to 12 m. The structures tested included a group of three structures of similar geometry, material, age, and geographic location. The testing program demonstrated the significance of the linearity of the response to different loading levels and the importance of permanent deformations in evaluating a structure. The field tests also gave evidence of the range of responses of similar structures, and showed some evidence of the development of an incipient mechanism. The analytical model included approximation of the load distribution through the fill and the restraint to movements of the arch ring developed by the fill and spandrel walls. Reasonable approximations of the experimentally observed response of the structures were obtained using the analytical model. Guidance in selecting material properties and stiffnesses for the abutments and fill-in modeling masonry arch structures is given.

AB - Fourteen full-size reinforced panels (membrane elements) made of 100 MPa high-strength concrete were biaxially tested in the universal panel tester at the University of Houston. A new servocontrol system, newly fitted to the panel tester, allowed us to conduct strain-control tests and, for the first time, to correctly measure the three-dimensional (3-D) stress-strain curves of panels and the descending branches of the compressive stress-strain curves of concrete. The 3-D stress-strain curves provided new insights into the failure processes, and thus revealed the true stress-strain relationships of concrete and steel that were misinterpreted in the past using the conventional two-dimensional (2-D) stress-strain curves. Five 100 MPa concrete panels in this research were subjected to biaxial tension-compression. By comparing the behavior of these panels with those of 42 and 65 MPa tested previously, the writers were able to evaluate the effect of concrete strength on the constitutive laws of concrete in compression. Because the softening coefficient in this law was found to be inversely proportional to the square root of concrete strength (fc′), those constitutive laws obtained previously for normal strength concrete can now be generalized to include concrete strengths up to 100 MPa. The remaining nine test panels were subjected to pure shear. The load-deformation behavior of these panels was correctly predicted by both the rotating-angle softened-truss model (RA-STM) and the fixed-angle softened-truss model (FA-STM). The range of applicability of these two models previously obtained for normal strength concrete were found to be valid for high-strength concrete as well. The failure modes of high-strength concrete panels were also predicted by a theoretical failure modes diagram.

AB - This paper presents an analytical study on the effect of panel zone (PZ) distortions on moment-resisting steel frame behavior. Analytical frame models were developed to study the influence of PZ distortions on frames with hinging beam and hinging column joints. A simple, trilinear analytical model was developed based on the mechanics of the column web and the flanges at the beam-column joint. Two bilinear rotational springs were needed at each joint to accurately simulate PZ distortions. Results suggest that simple analytical models that do not include PZ distortions underestimate the elastic drift and overestimate the base shear capacity for moment-resisting steel frames. Further, simple analytical models used to determine inelastic seismic behavior may underestimate the rotational ductility for beam-column joints.

AB - A control strategy based on the combination of feedforward and feedback gain controls (an open-closed loop) is presented for the reduction of the displacement response of the shear frame model of tall buildings to random ground motion, which is represented by double-filtered white noise. The control force is applied to the structure by an active mass damper (AMD) placed on the top of the building frame. The AMD controls the responses of the shear frames of different heights using the proposed control strategy. The responses of the same shear frames are also obtained by (1) Applying the conventional closed-loop control algorithm; and (2) allowing the AMD to act as a passive tuned mass damper (TMD). The responses obtained by the three different control strategies are compared for a parametric study.

AB - Making use of a relatively simple, approximate but reliable method of analysis, a study is made of the responses to horizontal base shaking of vertical, rigid circular cylindrical tanks that are filled with a uniform viscoelastic material. After describing the method of analysis, comprehensive numerical data are presented which elucidate the response of the system and the effects and relative importance of the various parameters involved. In addition to the characteristics of the ground motion, the parameters examined include the ratio of tank height-to-tank radius and the physical properties of the contained material. Both harmonic and earthquake-induced ground motions are considered. The response quantities examined are the dynamic wall pressures, the critical forces in the tank wall, and the forces exerted on the foundation. The effects of tank wall flexibility are studied in a companion paper.

AB - The analysis of the response to horizontal base shaking for solid-containing rigid tanks, described in a companion paper, is extended to flexible tanks. Simple, approximate expressions for the critical responses are formulated, and comprehensive numerical data are presented that elucidate the effects of wall flexibility over wide ranges of the parameters involved. The response quantities examined include the stresses induced on the wall, the maximum wall forces, and the forces transmitted to the foundation. In addition to long-period, effectively static excitations, harmonic motions of arbitrary frequency and an actual earthquake ground motion are considered. A brief account is also given of the interrelationship of the critical responses of solid-containing tanks and those induced in tanks storing a liquid of the same mass density.

AB - Interstate 90 crosses Mercer Slough near Bellevue, Washington. Mercer Slough is filled with a very soft, thick peat deposit. Very little is currently known about the dynamic behavior of such soils or the seismic response of bridges supported on peaty soils. In this study, the seismic response of the westbound structure of the I-90 bridges crossing Mercer Slough was investigated. Both linear spectral and nonlinear dynamic analyses were performed. For the spectral analysis, two different column and three different foundation stiffness values were used, along with two different earthquake spectra. For the nonlinear analyses, soil-structure interaction and inelastic column behavior were included. Equivalent Winkler-type pile foundation models were used with two different conditions of fixity at the pile cap. In addition, earthquake acceleration time-histories that included the effects of the soil motion were used. The response of the bridge from the nonlinear analysis was found to be similar to that from the spectral analyses, but the response was found to depend significantly on the foundation assumptions.

AB - A performance-mode (PM)-based evaluation procedure is proposed to determine the probability of unsatisfactory performance (UP) for two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) systems involving pile-supported dams. This methodology includes ductile behavior of individual piles for the strength mode. It also examines the 3-D effects on the bounds for the series-parallel system. The procedure is an extension of the reliability method presented to compute the system probability of UP of pile-supported structures using brittle-element behavior. Lateral and vertical deflections are the limit states of the pile cap that provide the system-level probability of UP for the serviceability limit state. The element-level probability of UP for strength and system-level probability of UP serviceability are combined to evaluate the bounds for the load-case specific system probability of UP. Finally, the overall system probability of UP is evaluated considering the contributions of all load cases combined. The procedure is illustrated with examples, and the bounds for the system probability of UP are evaluated. The results indicate that the bounds of probability of UP for the example are narrower for ductile behavior than for brittle behavior. A 3-D problem correctly recognizes a number of significant PM that are absent in the 2-D approximation.

AB - The Bayesian updating rule is used to assess the American Concrete Institute (ACI) model relating the elastic modulus of concrete to its compressive strength. Uncertainties inherent to the modeling process are identified. A likelihood function for the assessment of the model is derived assuming statistical independence between observations. This function is subsequently modified to account for model-induced correlation. It is shown that the correlation effectively reduces the amount of information contained in the data. The likelihood model is used with data available from literature and new data acquired at the University of California, Berkeley, for a specific concrete mix to compute the posterior statistics of the model parameters and to derive a predictive model for the elastic modulus of concrete. The presented approach is unique as it accounts for all sources of model uncertainty, deals with the important issue of model-induced correlation, and shows how Bayesian updating can be used to derive an improved predictive model for a specific concrete mix. Use of the proposed approach in performance-based codified design is discussed.

AB - This paper presents a nonlinear finite-element model for predicting the load-slip response of a single-shear nailed wood joint under reversed cyclic loading. Of particular interest is the post-yielding region of the load-slip response at which the deformation of the nail is large. In the proposed theory, the nail is modeled using a finite beam element approximation that incorporates the effects of large deformation and hysteretic nature of the stress-strain behavior of the material. The embedment behavior of wood under the action of a nail is described through a hysteresis model developed by the writers. In addition the effects of shear deformation in the nail and friction between nail and wood are incorporated into the model. Results from material tests conducted to characterize the embedment behavior of wood and stress-strain curve of nail material, and from joint tests to verify the finite-element model, are presented. A comparison of test data with model predictions demonstrates the validity of the model. The present theory can be extended to analyze wood joints containing other dowel-type fasteners.

AB - A finite-element formulation that can be used for the analysis of reinforced-concrete shells subjected to thermal and mechanical loads is presented. It incorporates the nonlinear material model for concrete, which takes into account cracking of concrete, tension stiffening, softening of concrete in compression, and yielding of reinforcement. The finite elements used are the degenerate, isoparametric shell elements. The resulting finite-element procedure was checked by comparison of the theoretical and experimental results. A parametric study was undertaken, in which several special considerations associated with the thermal analysis of reinforced concrete were addressed and discussed.
