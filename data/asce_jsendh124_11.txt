AB - This paper describes the results of cyclic loading tests applied to 14 full-scale beam-column subassemblages. First, efforts undertaken in the Japanese steel community in response to damage observed at welded beam-to-column connections in the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu (Kobe) Earthquake are introduced. Second, the major test parameters chosen in this study are described: type of steel, type of connection, type of weld access holes, type of weld tabs, and type of loading. Third, the test results are presented in terms of the ductility capacity of the test specimens. Major findings are as follows: (1) All specimens developed plastic rotations and cumulative plastic rotations of 0.03 rad and 0.3 rad, respectively, suggesting that ductility capacity of the specimens was sufficient in light of present Japanese seismic design; (2) dynamic loading had no detrimental effect on ductility capacity; (3) ductility capacity was significantly smaller for specimens with steel weld tabs than for those with flux tabs made of ceramic; and (4) modified details for the weld access hole had an effect of preventing cracks initiating from the toe of the weld access hole.

AB - This paper presents a detailed examination of the experimental behavior of 14 full-scale, welded beam-column subassemblages. First, ductility capacity of the specimens is evaluated in terms of cumulative plastic rotation and maximum skeleton rotation. Second, the effects of dynamic loading are examined in reference to the maximum resistance, ductility capacity, and failure mode of the specimens. Dynamic loading generally increased ductility capacity and produced a more ductile mode of fracture. A significant rise in temperature observed in the dynamic loading tests was the likely cause of the larger ductility capacity and more ductile fracture. Third, strains in the vicinity of beam ends are examined. Strain distributions along the beam flange width were found to be very complex, and were significantly larger at the flange edges over the flange midwidth. Fourth, fracture surfaces were examined from fractography analysis. Changes in material hardness before and after the test are also investigated, and correlation between the hardness increase and cumulative plastic strain was quantified.

AB - Most deck-truss bridges have been designed and constructed without seismic resistance considerations; as a result, their members, connections, and frequently their substructure are not sized and detailed to provide the ductile response needed during major earthquakes. A ductile seismic retrofit solution proposed here consists of converting the deck slab into a composite slab and replacing the end cross-frames and the lower lateral braced panels adjacent to the supports by special ductile diaphragms, thus creating ductile fuses to protect the remaining superstructure and substructure. This paper illustrates the typical seismic vulnerability of such bridges, presents a model governing transverse seismic response of retrofitted deck-trusses, and a methodology to determine overall stiffness and strength of such ductile panels based on developed seismic performance goals. The results of computer simulations for a retrofitted deck-truss subjected to severe ground excitation validates the proposed methodology and the global modeling. It is concluded that the proposed ductile retrofit solution can significantly enhance seismic performance of deck-trusses.

AB - A companion paper has demonstrated how deck-truss bridges can be retrofitted by converting the end cross-frames and lower end panels adjacent to the truss supports into special ductile panels. However, the design of such retrofitted systems must respect constraints on flexibilities to limit global drifts and ductility demands, as well as other constraints germane to the type of ductile device introduced. Proposed, here, are performance based design procedures accompanied by graphical approaches that incorporate all of those constraints affecting seismic response of deck-truss bridges retrofitted using eccentrically braced frames, vertical shear links, or triangular-plate added damping and stiffness device ductile systems. Using the proposed method, ductile panels for a 80-m-span deck-truss example bridge using eccentrically braced frames, vertical shear links, and triangular-plate added damping and stiffness device were designed, detailed, and modeled by computer. From the results of nonlinear inelastic time history analyses of the retrofitted bridge, it is concluded that all three systems designed according to the proposed procedure perform satisfactorily and enhanced seismic performance of the deck-truss bridges.

AB - This paper discusses the optimum design of tuned mass damper (TMD) for seismically excited building structures. In the design process the multi degree of freedom structures are considered so that it makes improvement to the available design procedures so far, where usually only single mode model is considered. The H2 norm of the transfer function from the external disturbance to a certain regulated output is taken as a performance measure of the optimization criterion. The genetic algorithm, which has been successfully applied in many applications, is used to find the optimum value of TMD parameters. The numerical examples for optimum parameters of TMD for multi degree of freedom structures are presented to show the effectiveness of this design procedure. It is shown that by using the proposed procedure, the optimum value of the mass damper can be determined without specifying the modes to be controlled. A comparison is also made to the Den Hartog and Warburton approaches.

AB - This paper reviews, compares, and contrasts the three methodologies proposed by C. A. Cornell, by Y. K. Wen, and by FEMA 273 (as proposed by H. Krawinkler) for predicting the postelastic response of buildings subject to seismic excitation. All three methods have the potential to contribute effectively to the problem of improving the practical prediction of seismic response of structures. Applications include preliminary design, routine (code) use, calibration of codes, and specific structure assessment. These methods appear different because their authors did not share the same objectives or information bases. The methods by Cornell and Wen are decisively prediction-oriented in explicitly probabilistic frameworks. The approach suggested by Krawinkler has instead the goal of understanding in some average sense the seismic response of structures at various performance levels. This last method has been adopted, however, for prediction purposes by the FEMA 273 Guidelines for rehabilitation of existing buildings. Despite the differences, the work proposed by these researchers is profitably brought under the same perspective here.

AB - An accurate finite-element-method-based analysis to predict the ultimate hysteretic behavior of thin-walled steel columns subjected to seismic loading is presented in this paper. For this purpose, we develop the three-surface cyclic metal plasticity model. The three-surface model includes less material parameters and internal variables for the ease of its implementation in the finite-element method analysis. This model is characterized by a discontinuous surface inserted between the yield surface and the bounding surface. The discontinuous surface is used to express the yield plateau and the change of hardening coefficient. Most material parameters in the three-surface model can be determined by the tensile coupon test. However, three parameters independent of material types are calibrated by the existing cyclic loading test results of thin-walled steel columns. This is to improve the accuracy of this analysis specifically in the simulation of the localized buckling behavior, which accompanies extremely large plastic strains.

AB - An active mass driver has been designed for installation on the upper observation deck of the 310 m Nanjing TV transmission tower in China in order to reduce the acceleration response under strong wind gusts. In this paper, the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG), H∞, and continuous sliding mode control (CSMC) strategies have been applied to the active mass driver system based on the acceleration feedbacks. Emphasis is placed on the practical applications of LQG, H∞, and CSMC controllers, including limitations on the actuator peak force and stroke, the limited number of sensors, and noise pollution. Further, a method for modulating the control effort for the CSMC controller is proposed in this paper to satisfy the practical constraints on the actuator. A state reduced-order system has been established to design the dynamic output feedback controllers. The wind loads acting on the tower are defined by the Davenport cross-power spectral density matrix. Simulation results demonstrate that, when designed appropriately, the LQG, H∞, and CSMC control strategies are suitable for full-scale implementations of the active mass driver, and their control performances are quite remarkable.

AB - In this paper, a finite difference formulation for vibration analysis of structural cables is introduced. This formulation incorporates into a unified solution the effects of the bending stiffness of cable and its sag-extensibility characteristics and provides a tool for accurate determination of vibration mode shapes and frequencies. Various cable-end conditions, variable cross sections, and intermediate springs and/or dampers are taken into account. Using a nondimensional form of this formulation, a parametric study was conducted on the effects of sag-extensibility and bending stiffness. The formulation is verified with available theoretical solutions and compared with finite-element analyses. Capabilities of this formulation are demonstrated through examples. A simple relationship among nondimensional cable parameters is also introduced for the range of parameters applicable to stay cables in cable-stayed bridges. This simple relationship provides an accurate tool for measurement of tension forces in stay cables using the vibration method.

AB - This paper describes a new method for shape and member-size optimization of a plane truss by using techniques of parametric curves. Description of nodal coordinates as well as cross-sectional areas in terms of Bézier curves enables one to find a smooth optimal truss. The optimal truss is found under the constraints such that all the response strains to multiple design loads including static loads and earthquake excitation are within a prescribed range. The objective function to be minimized is a weighted sum of the total structural mass and the deviation of the shape from the one preferred by the designer. The latter is written explicitly in terms of the coordinates of the control points. Side constraints are easily incorporated based on the convex hull property of the Bézier curve. In the examples, optimal trusses are found under single and multiple loading conditions and the characteristics of the optimal trusses in reference to the weight coefficients are discussed.

AB - The optimum structural shape design of skeletal structures has traditionally been solved by using conceptual designs, often based on ground structures, in which the generated designs resemble the conceptual designs. If the design could be approached without the use of conceptual designs or ground structures, there is a potential for generating new and innovative designs, especially when more complex design problems are attempted. A methodology using such a design approach, made possible by the use of the genetic algorithm, is proposed in this paper. The proposed methodology uses the genetic algorithm to evolve optimum structural shape designs, which are free to assume any geometry and topology. The sizing, configurational, and topological aspects of the design are simultaneously addressed. Discrete member sizes are considered. The methodology is capable of addressing single and multiple loadings, and plane or space structures. A new string representation scheme, generalized penalty function, and fitness function are introduced. The proposed methodology is applied to two illustrative examples involving single-span plane trusses and the results described.

AB - The procedures involved in the use of a typical finite-element model for the development of prediction charts for partially clamped, reinforced concrete slabs, under uniformly distributed loading, are demonstrated in this paper. Test results from two sets of four, partially clamped slabs are used as a basis for finite-element simulation and extensive parametric studies, to identify the set of computational conditions and model parameter values, which would guarantee reliable prediction for similar slabs. The direct finite-element simulation of nine other partially clamped slabs, with the identified values, gave an average experiment-to-predicted strength ratio of 0.93. The developed finite-element model is then used for the analysis of a total of 450 “computer-model,” partially clamped slabs, resulting from various geometric dimensions, material strengths and reinforcement ratios, and the resulting database of ultimate strengths is used for chart development. Predictions from the developed charts, for partially clamped slabs of similar configuration, are found to be of the same order of accuracy as the direct finite-element analysis. Other design applications of the outlined procedure are also discussed.

AB - Lining of rigid pipelines has emerged as a competitive alternative solution to conventional pipeline replacement. Due to the nature of the liner installation process, the final liner may end up being loosely fitted into the damaged pipeline. The liner should safely carry any external pressure due to the ground water. This study considers the effect of an initial gap between the circular liner and the circular host pipe on the critical buckling pressure. The finite-element method is used for the evaluation of the critical pressure for loosely fitted circular liners. The interface between the circular liner and the host pipes is assumed to be smooth. A brief description of the finite-element model and the analysis is given, followed by a parametric study for the effect of gap size and liner thickness-to-radius ratio on the stability of the liner. The results of this study are reported in a form suitable for design purposes. The work includes comparisons between the writers' numerical solution and previous theoretical solutions and experimental work.

AB - The weight advantage of light-weight construction materials such as steel or fiber-reinforced plastics is usually accompanied by the disadvantage of greater costs when compared with, e.g., reinforced concrete. This cost disadvantage makes light-weight materials uneconomical for many kinds of structures, because the advantage of reduced weight cannot efficiently be transformed into a cost benefit. For certain kinds of structures, however, weight reduction at the right locations conveys cost savings large enough to compensate for the higher material cost. Typical examples are high-rise buildings and long-span bridges, where light-weight materials can result in overall cost savings when used in the upper floors of the building or in the midspan region of the bridge. The weight-versus-cost problem is analytically investigated for a fan-type, cable-stayed bridge. A break-even point is determined that indicates the extension of the main-span center part that should be made of light-weight material to minimize overall costs. Results of example calculations are presented.

AB - A simple, easy-to-apply effective torsional constant for the rotational stiffness of a restrained open section was developed. This effective torsional constant takes both the pure torsion and the warping torsion into acccount. The final result is a simple formula for a modified torsional constant, which is in terms of unbraced length and can be easily calculated. The constant then can be used for any generic finite-element structural analysis program.
