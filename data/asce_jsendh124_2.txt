AB - A large-scale, four-story, single bay steel plate shear wall specimen with unstiffened panels was tested using controlled cyclic loading to determine its behavior under an idealized severe earthquake event. The shear wall had moment-resisting beam-to-column connections, resulting in a lateral load-resisting system that possesses an inherent redundancy. Gravity loads were applied at the top of the wall and equal horizontal loads were applied at the four floor levels. The specimen endured 30 cycles of loading during the test, of which 20 cycles were in the inelastic range. Prior to failure of the specimen, the deflection reached in the lowest story was nine times the yield deflection. The test specimen proved to be initially very stiff, showed excellent ductility and energy dissipation characteristics, and exhibited stable behavior at very large deformations and after many cycles of loading. A description of the test setup, loading procedures, and specimen behavior is presented.

AB - A nonlinear finite-element model for steel plate shear walls was developed and then tested using the as-built dimensions and measured material properties of a large-scale four-story test specimen. When a nonplanar initial plate geometry and measured residual stresses were included in the model, it gave an excellent prediction of the load versus deflection response. Furthermore, a good prediction of the ultimate strength of the shear wall was obtained even when the second-order effects were neglected. Another analytical method is presented that is useful for the prediction of monotonic behavior. In this relatively simple plane frame model, the infill plate is represented as a series of tension strips. The model gave a good prediction of the behavior of the four-story shear wall specimen. An associated hysteresis model also gave good predictions of observed cyclic behavior. The models account for inelastic behavior in both the infill panels and the frame members.

AB - The paper describes a test program on cold-formed plain channel columns compressed between fixed ends and pinned ends. Whereas it is well-known that local buckling of pin-ended channel columns induces overall bending, this phenomenon does not occur in fixed-ended channel columns that remain straight after local buckling and only bend when overall buckling occurs. These fundamentally different effects of local buckling on the behavior of pin-ended and fixed-ended channel sections lead to inconsistencies in traditional design approaches, which account for full or partial rotational end restraint solely by using effective lengths. A series of tests was performed for different geometries of cross section fabricated by brake pressing from high-strength steel sheet. Tests were performed over a range of lengths such that the column curve could be obtained. Local buckling loads were also obtained from the fixed-ended column tests. Detailed measurements of local and overall geometric imperfections, material properties, and residual stresses were conducted. The purpose of this paper is first to present and compare the test strengths with existing Australian/New Zealand, American, and European specifications for cold-formed steel structures and, second, to propose recommendations for the design of fixed-ended singly symmetric columns.

AB - The paper describes a series of tests on lipped channels compressed between fixed ends. Complete column curves were obtained for two cross sections with different flange slenderness. Detailed measurements were conducted of the material properties, residual stresses, and local and overall geometric imperfections. The test strengths are compared with the rules of the Australian, American, and European specifications for cold-formed steel structures. It is shown that a fixed-ended channel column can be designed using an effective length of one-half of the column length and assuming the applied force acts at the centroid of the effective section. Pin-ended column tests of the same cross sections were conducted for reference. It was shown that the current design rules lead to very conservative predictions. The shift of the effective centroid, as predicted by the Australian and American specifications, was shown to be inaccurate compared with the tests for the cross section with slender flanges. This led to the abnormal result of an increase in column strength with increasing length.

AB - During the expected service life of a transmission tower, the members are subjected to a large number of significant stress fluctuations resulting from alternating wind applications. Fatigue behavior due to repeated loading must therefore be considered in design. This study presents the fatigue-test results of 52 cold-formed steel members. The experimental program involved the use of five cross-sectional shapes, two test temperatures (−50°C and 25°C), and two steel types, ASTM A715 grade 60 steel and CAN/CSA-G40.21-M 300W. A series of constant amplitude axial fatigue tests were conducted using a loading frequency that ranged from 1–2.5 Hz. All specimens were supported at the ends through bolted connections and were tested under load-controlled condition in a fully reversed load-cycle. Stress-strain response was monitored at different stages of the test until failure. A group of S-N and Load-N curves were developed for the purpose of determining the safe endurance limit. The results obtained could be used to establish guidelines for fatigue design of cold-formed steel sections.

AB - Two new series of experimental full-scale tests have been performed on steel columns at elevated temperature, either under small or large eccentricities. Those results have been introduced in a database, together with results from previous tests found in the literature. An analytical formula for the buckling coefficient presented as shown in an earlier paper has been calibrated here by comparison with the results of tests made with no or with small eccentricity. The analytical proposal for a P-M interaction curve presented in the companion paper has been compared in this paper with all the results from the database, and proved to provide a satisfactory agreement.

AB - This paper presents a model for the determination of the serviceability and ultimate moment capacities of bolted moment end plate connections utilizing rectangular hollow sections and two rows of bolts. One row of bolts is positioned above the top flange, and the other is positioned symmetrically below the bottom flange. The model considers the combined effects of prying action caused by flexible end plates and the formation of yield lines in the end plates. The model is calibrated and validated using experimental data from an associated test program. The design model constitutes a relatively simple method for predicting the serviceability and ultimate moment capacities for the particular type of bolted moment end plate connection described here. An example is given to illustrate how the design model can be applied to practical connection designs.

AB - An arch loaded in-plane may suddenly deflect laterally and twist out of the plane of loading and fail in a flexural-torsional buckling mode. This paper investigates the out-of-plane inelastic flexural-torsional buckling and strength of steel arches using a finite-element model in a three-dimensional nonlinear inelastic analysis. The 3D elastic-plastic behavior of an arch is determined by taking into account the effects of the in-plane curvature of the arch, subtended angle, large deformations, material inelasticity, initial crookedness, and residual stresses. The strengths of steel arches in uniform compression and in uniform bending are studied. It is found that the design rules for steel columns and beams cannot be used directly for the design of steel arches. Design rules for steel arches in uniform compression and in uniform bending are developed based on the results of the finite-element analyses. The effects of initial crookedness and twist, residual stresses, and yield stress on the strengths of arches are also investigated.

AB - Nonlinear analyses have been conducted on three-dimensional finite element models of transversely stiffened plate girder web panels (without longitudinal stiffeners) subjected to pure shear, including the effects of initial out-of-flatness. Currently, the design equations for shear in plate girder web panels in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) specifications account for elastic shear buckling strength and postbuckling strength separately and combine these resisting capacities based on the aspect ratio of the web panels. Although equations in these specifications predict the overall shear strength with reasonable accuracy, they often underestimate the elastic shear buckling strength, due to an underestimation of the rigidity at the flange-web juncture, and often overestimate the postbuckling strength of certain web panels, as a result of excluding the effect of out-of-plane bending stresses. Based on a parametric study of numerical results, new design equations are proposed for the determination of ultimate shear strengths of web panels. To validate these equations, ultimate shear strengths computed from the equations are compared with existing experimental data.

AB - In this paper, the problem of the local resistance of wood beneath a bolt connector subjected to shear is studied both in the case of load parallel to the grain and perpendicular to the grain. Two specific test methods were adopted in order to study the influence of lateral confinement. Thin plate specimens of glued laminated wood pierced through by a steel bar (16 mm diameter) were considered to simulate a real situation. From the load-slip curves, the initial stiffness and the embedding strength of wood beneath the connector were estimated. Moreover, the geometric interferometry technique made it possible to obtain the entire field of displacements in the wood surrounding the bolt. Comparisons of test results with existing data are in good agreement for specimens without confinement. Confined specimens show a slight increase in bearing capacity for load parallel to the grain and a significant increase of the ultimate bearing capacity for load perpendicular to the grain. Negligible differences were noted in deformability.

AB - Canadian warships are equipped with free-standing latticed masts, and the research reported here has been aimed at reducing the weight and profile area of these structures and increasing their ability to absorb energy. From initial studies of 11 latticed configurations, a control configuration was selected and an innovative one was compared with it, with encouraging results. This innovation is considered to be applicable not only to warship masts, but also to other latticed structures such as transmission towers, latticed beam-columns, and free-standing and guyed masts. Although this research contains an experimental component, no experiments have been conducted on the innovative configuration. Such experiments constitute additional research that is needed.

AB - Analysis of gust winds in the United States has resulted in a new wind speed map for design-level winds. The map is based on 50-year peak gust speeds rather than fastest mile speeds used in the national wind load standard ANSI/ASCE 7-93. The change in gust duration is necessary because the fastest mile wind record has ended. A new technique was used to reduce variability due to sampling error in non-hurricane areas. Individual stations were demonstrated to be statistically independent and were combined as regional superstations. The purpose was to decrease sampling error by effectively increasing sample length. Wind speeds on the hurricane coast were converted from fastest mile to peak gust using new information on gusts in hurricanes. In addition, three Monte Carlo studies of hurricane speeds were considered in place of the one study available for the earlier map. Wind speeds for various return periods are presented.

AB - In the early 1980s, a glass failure prediction model (GFPM) was introduced to resolve differences in U.S. industry procedures used to determine the minimum thickness of glass required to resist a specified uniform lateral pressure. The differences in these industry procedures continue to cause problems for designers who are forced to choose between two different glass thickness selection methods that result in different specified thicknesses of glass for the same loading. Since its introduction, the GFPM has helped resolve industry conflicts as it has gained increasing acceptance. In the late 1980s, the GFPM was used to develop glass thickness selection information that is incorporated in ASTM E 1300-94. The purpose of this paper is to provide documentation for the ASTM E 1300-94 glass thickness selection procedure and to propose improvements. The proposed improvements include modifications to the optional procedure for calculating the probability of failure of a rectangular glass plate, and the presentation of a new set of dual-unit glass thickness selection charts.
