AB - It is now fairly common practice to glue steel plates to the tension faces of existing reinforced concrete slabs, as it is an inexpensive and unobtrusive upgrading procedure for strengthening and stiffening. However, the application of this technique to continuous reinforced-concrete beams, as opposed to slabs, is severely restricted by premature debonding of the ends of the tension-face plates through the action of vertical shear forces, that is, shear peeling. An experimental study is presented in which steel plates are glued to the sides of reinforced-concrete beams specifically to inhibit shear peeling of the tension-face plates. The results are incorporated into a design procedure for plating the tension faces of continuous composite beams that can allow for any distribution of applied loads, any variation of the cross-section properties along the length of the beam, and the time effects of creep and shrinkage, as well as propped and unpropped construction. The procedure is then applied to the strengthening and stiffening of a continuous reinforced-concrete beam for strength and serviceability requirements.

AB - An experimental study of the behavior of reinforced concrete columns and results of a nonlinear finite-element analysis are presented. Twelve full-scale columns with square sections were tested under eccentric monotonic loading. Effects of key parameters such as concrete strength, stirrup spacing, slenderness of the columns, and eccentricity of the applied axial load were studied. Significant gains in load capacity were obtained with increased concrete strength. The results of the finite-element analysis correlate well with the results of the tests. A parametric study was made to examine the difference in failure modes for the different concrete strengths, length-to-width ratios, and loading eccentricities. The higher compressive concrete strength was especially advantageous when the load eccentricity was small. When the eccentricity was increased, the strength of the high-strength concrete columns decreased more rapidly than that of the normal-strength columns. However, the high-strength concrete columns still exhibited a greater load capacity than the normal-strength columns.

AB - This paper presents the experimental results of six scaled high-strength concrete columns with concrete compressive strengths of 76–86 MPa. Primary experimental parameters include axial loads ranging from 10 to 20% of column axial load-carrying capacity based on concrete gross section; longitudinal steel ratios of 2.46 to 3.53% of the gross sectional area; and volumetric ratios of transverse reinforcement ranging from 1.63 to 3.67%. Model columns with transverse reinforcement designed following the seismic provisions of current code developed sufficient ductility, with displacement ductility factors equal to or exceeding 6.0. The model columns designed with 50% of the transverse reinforcement required by current code also developed sufficient ductility when the axial load was 10% of its axial load-carrying capacity. Lateral load-carrying capacities of all the columns exceeded the flexural capacities calculated based on the equivalent concrete stress block used in current design code. Seismic shear strength of high-strength concrete columns was also examined, based on the test results and analytical approaches.

AB - Tests on 127 × 127 × 381 mm concrete columns were carried out to study the efficacy of welded-wire fabric (WWF) as confining transverse reinforcement in columns. Three different wire spacings and a total of five wire sizes were used. The WWF was placed transversely in columns at close longitudinal spacing. The longitudinal spacing to column width ratio (S/D) varied from 0.1 to 0.3. For each of the five wire sizes, four different S/D ratios were used. This resulted in 20 reinforced column specimen designs. Each design was tested under displacement-controlled uniaxial compression with three identical specimens. The axial stress-strain curves were recorded. For the range of parameters tested, the WWF reinforcement provided varied degree of confinement to the concrete, as reflected in the varied level of enhancement of concrete strength and ductility. The S/D ratio seems to have a more dominant effect on confinement than the volumetric ratio of WWF. From the test results, a relationship between the S/D ratio and the volumetric ratio of WWF was deduced to serve as a boundary separating ductile behavior of the confined concrete from brittle behavior. It is concluded that, with proper design, WWF can be effective in providing lateral confinement to concrete in column construction. Further study using large columns is suggested.

AB - The effect of longitudinal spacing of transverse reinforcement on the confining stress in concrete columns is studied analytically. A linear-elastic solution is obtained for circular columns laterally confined by hoops. From this solution, an effective confining stress at any point and an average confining factor for circular transverse cross sections are defined. The relationship between the average confining factor and the longitudinal spacing of hoops is established from the numerical results of the analytical solution. The same procedure is then applied through a series of finite-element analyses to square columns transversely reinforced with welded-wire fabric. The resulting formula relating the longitudinal spacing and the average confining factor is remarkably similar to that found from the circular column analysis.

AB - A comprehensive analytical model has been developed and presented in this paper to study the response of unreinforced masonry to in-plane dynamic loads, including earthquake loads. The analysis has been implemented in a nonlinear finite element program. Masonry is treated as a nonlinear homogeneous orthotropic material. A failure envelope has also been developed that is capable of predicting both joint sliding and the cracking and/or crushing types of failure. The effect of bed joint orientation has been considered; this is achieved through a ubiquitous joint model. The model is capable of performing both static and time history analyses of masonry structures. Nonlinear dynamic analysis is carried out using the Modified Newton-Raphson iteration scheme in conjunction with the Newmark time integration algorithm. To calibrate the model and to demonstrate its applications, several numerical examples have been treated, and the results have been compared with those from full-scale tests on masonry shear walls under both cyclic and dynamic loads. Reasonably good agreement has been found between the analytical and experimental results.

AB - A general step-by-step model for the nonlinear and time-dependent analysis of reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, and composite steel-concrete planar frame structures is presented. The model can simulate segmental construction processes such as changes in either the longitudinal and cross-sectional geometry or in the properties of the materials; the placement or removal of elements, prestressing tendons, and stays; and modifications in the internal and external boundary conditions. The nonlinear time-dependent materials properties, the structural effects of the delayed deformations, and the second-order effects are also considered in the structural analysis under loads and imposed deformations. The model can trace structural response during the construction of the structure and throughout its service life. Consideration of the geometric and material nonlinearities allows the structural response to be traced through the elastic, cracked, and ultimate load level, providing valuable information about the influence of the construction process on the short- and long-term carrying capacity of the structure. Complex phenomena such as delayed cracking, nonlinear creep, or creep buckling can also be captured by the model.

AB - The hysteretic behavior of reinforced concrete structures depends to a large extent on the hysteretic behavior of reinforcing steel. An accurate and computationally efficient numerical model of reinforcing steel is, thus, very important in the analysis and evaluation of these structures under cyclic loads, including earthquake loads. A new macroscopic hysteretic model of the short-term cyclic behavior or ordinary and high-strength reinforcing steel is presented. The model is based on a uniaxial stress-strain relation that is expressed in terms of natural stresses and strains, so that a single envelope curve governs the monotonic behavior in tension and compression. The hysteretic model accounts for the degradation of strength properties with accumulation of plastic strains. The material parameters of the model are calibrated with monotonic tests of coupon specimens, while strength degradation relations are derived from cyclic test data. Correlation studies of the model with available experimental data for ordinary and high-strength reinforcing steel demonstrate the ability of the model to simulate the hysteretic behavior of all types of reinforcing steel over a wide range of strain variations.

AB - In the assessment of existing reinforced concrete structures, finite-element analysis plays an important role, particularly in regard to the evaluation of critical regions, regions with special detailing, or regions of stress concentration. A popular class of concrete model uses an orthotropic constitutive relation in which the directions of orthotropy are the principal directions of total strain. Since these directions change during the load-displacement response, such an approach is known as a rotating crack model. The models proposed to date differ in the description of the biaxial failure envelope, the uniaxial equivalent stress-strain relation, Poisson ratio, and the tension-compression behavior. This paper describes the implementation of an orthotropic concrete constitutive model in the finite-element analysis of reinforced concrete members. The emphasis of the paper is on the evaluation of the effect of orthotropic model parameters on the monotonic load-displacement relation of shear panels and walls under different stress states. The ability of the orthotropic concrete material model to assess failure mode, ultimate strength, and load-deformation behavior of this type of structural element is evaluated by correlation studies with available experimental data.

AB - Experience has demonstrated that highway bridges are vulnerable to damage from environmental attack, such as alkali-silica reaction, corrosion, and freeze-thaw. To make rational decisions in a life-cycle cost perspective, reliable prediction of the service life of deteriorating highway bridges is necessary. To obtain an accurate insight into this problem, time-variant reliability methods have to be used. The application of these methods in the performance and safety assessment of deteriorating structures is relatively new. In this study, the reliability of reinforced concrete highway girder bridges under aggressive conditions is investigated using a time-variant series system reliability approach in which both load and resistance are time-dependent. Monte Carlo simulation is used to find the cumulative-time system failure probability. An existing reinforced-concrete T-beam bridge located near Pueblo, Colo., is investigated. The effects of various parameters such as variabilities in dead and live loads, live load occurrence rate, strength loss rate, degradation initiation time, resistance correlation, and number of girders under attack on the time-variant bridge reliability are studied. The results can be used to better predict the service life of deteriorating reinforced concrete bridges, and to develop optimal lifetime reliability-based maintenance strategies for these bridges.

AB - The optimal design of trusses subjected to loads considered to be uncertain in both magnitude and direction is investigated. A non-probabilistic ellipsoidal convex model is established for considering the uncertainties using three different criteria. The convex model is described as a set of constraints on the upper and lower limits of the load magnitudes and directions. The optimal design of the trusses is performed using two different optimization objectives. The first objective function to be minimized is the structural volume; constraints are imposed on the stresses and buckling loads of the members and on the joint displacements. Another objective function to be minimized is a selected displacement; constraints are implemented on the stresses and buckling loads of the members and on the structural volume. The presented method yields optimal designs that violate stress, displacement, and buckling constraints with less frequency than the assumed worst load condition. This method offers an alternative to formal probabilistic methods.

AB - This paper describes the experimental and theoretical behavior of two large-scale pressurized pipes tested with a sleeve fully welded to the midspan of each specimen. Each specimen was subjected to an internal pressure, a constant axial load and lateral deformation of a four-point bend test to simulate the flexural behavior of a buried pipeline. The only test parameter was the length of the sleeve needed for pipe repair; one specimen had a sleeve length equal to one pipe diameter, and the second specimen had a sleeve that was two pipe diameters in length. Flexural deformations were imposed on each test specimen until clear failure occurred. For both specimens, failure occurred by local wall buckling of the carrier pipe adjacent to the sleeve region. A simple theoretical model is discussed to predict the flexural capacity of pipes subjected to these load conditions. This analytical method was developed to enable a quick computation of the inelastic flexural strength of the pipe, and to enable a check of the output from a more sophisticated finite element analysis. Reasonably good agreement was found between the theoretical and the experimental flexural capacity of the pressurized pipe. Analytical results demonstrated that the Tresca yield criterion conservatively estimated the inelastic flexural strength of the pressurized pipe. It was also found that, when using the Tresca criterion to describe the inelastic behavior of the pipes tested in this research program, local inelastic wall buckling was initiated at a displacement ductility of about 3.

AB - In this paper, a new boundary element method for the interaction between frictional bolts and rock mass is presented by formulating the surface frictional forces of the bolts in terms of the displacements of the rock mass. The corresponding formulation for the underground openings supported by frictional bolts is derived. The action of the bolts on the rock mass is reduced to line integrals along the bolt length. Then the bolts are discretized into a number of quadratic elements. Analytical expressions are obtained when the source point coincides with one of the element nodes. Formulations for calculating the stress at internal points are also presented. The algebraic equations are established by the usual nodal collocation scheme. A computer code for the approach has been written based on the linear element program. Finally, two examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.
