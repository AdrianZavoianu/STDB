AB - This paper describes two series of tests performed on slender I-sections fabricated from high-strength steel plates by welding. Eight tests were conducted on each series. The objectives of the test program were: (1) to determine the section capacities and the shape of the interaction curves for two slender I-sections subjected to compression and major axis bending; and (2) to compare the results with design strength predictions by codes of practice. The study focused on the shape of the interaction curves and whether the curves used in the main codes of practice, which are largely based on compact or semicompact cross sections, are also applicable to slender cross sections. Generally, the design axial and bending section capacities predicted by the main codes of practice were conservative, as were the design interaction curves. The experimental interaction curves were close to linear for both test series. This is in agreement with the design interaction curves given by the Australian, British, and European specifications for steel structures. However, the use of a bilinear interaction curve, as stipulated in the American specification, was not evident in the test results.

AB - Cross-bracing in which the bolted steel angle members are alternately in compression and tension is widely used in latticed tower structures. Within each set of cross-bracing, the tie is generally assumed to restrain the strut at the cross-over joint. A series of 13 tests on cross-bracing systems is described, with slenderness ratios in the range of 102 to 160. Other variables include the inclination of the main legs and bracing, the number of bolts in each end connection, and the size of the main leg relative to the bracing. The measured behavior is compared with the results of a flexibility-based analysis and the formulas from the American and European transmission tower design manuals. The behavior is complex, but the importance of end eccentricity and number of bolts in the connection of the bracing to the main legs is apparent in these results. A secant-based design formulation is shown to provide accurate predictions of the strength of the cross-bracing.

AB - This paper describes the behavior of profiled concrete shear panels that may be used as core walls in framed construction. This research developed as a part of a larger program of work on a novel form of composite walling system that utilizes double skins of profiled steel sheeting to form a sandwich construction. The work reported here involves the profiled concrete alone and provides information on the behavior of concrete walls that may be formed with a profiled surface. Model tests of 1/6 scale using microconcrete confirmed that the diagonal tension limit state should be the design criterion and the shear resistance of the profiled panels can be derived from its equivalent plain concrete panel. Compared to plain concrete panels, the state of stress within the panel and its boundaries is changed due to profile geometry. It has been found that a reduction factor may be introduced in the design equation to take into account the effect of hysteretic application of load. Finite-element simulation of the profiled panels was found to be good enough to predict the precracking behavior.

AB - An extensive parametric study is presented of the distributions of stress concentration factors in tubular K-joints commonly found in offshore platforms. The study covers a comprehensive range of geometric joint parameters for balanced in-plane moment loading. The results of the study were first used to assess two sets of widely used parametric equations, which predict the maximum stress concentration factors on the outer surfaces of the chord and the brace. The new database of finite-element results was then used to develop parametric equations for predicting stress concentration factors at key locations around the intersection on the outer as well as the inner surfaces of the chord. The reliability of the proposed and existing parametric equations was then assessed using an acrylic test joint database and some published test data measured from a steel model. Fracture mechanics fatigue calculations were also performed to demonstrate that the information provided from the proposed equations could be utilized to obtain accurate, and safe, fatigue life estimates.

AB - A carriage position adjustment procedure for the triangular running skyline system (TRS) has been developed and tested for performance using a reduced-scale model. The TRS system is a logging cable system that covers an extent of triangular area determined by the positioning of its three spars. Previous studies of the TRS system used improved static theories to estimate cable line lengths for accurate positioning of the carriage. However, the experimental results revealed that carriage positioning error is inevitable and that an adjustment procedure should be developed. In the present study, two adjustment methods were tested: method Lo, which directly corrects cable line lengths, and method E, which corrects given Young's modulus of the cable used as lines. A series of adjustment tests have shown that one repetition of adjustment by method Lo sufficiently reduces carriage positioning error and that method E often gives overvalued corrections of line lengths.

AB - Hollow sections are generally either circular-to-circular (CCHS) or rectangular-to-rectangular (RRHS). Structures with circular braces and rectangular chords (CRHS) may have advantages in certain applications, combining a simple joint geometry for fabrication and relatively lower stress concentration factors (SCFs). Seven different CRHS joints were fatigue tested in constant amplitude axial loading. SCFs were measured experimentally and compared with various parametric formulas. The SCF values for CRHS joints were found to be between those of CCHS and RRHS joints. On the basis of measured SCF values for CRHS joints, the fatigue strength was in good agreement with current fatigue design codes. Parametric formulas for RRHS joints were in all cases found to give conservative prediction of SCF. Lacking more rational prediction methods, these formulas in combination with the DEn T curve/AWS X2 curves for tubular joints may be used in fatigue design of CRHS joints.

AB - The seismic performance of liquid-storage steel tanks can be improved by anchoring them to their foundations with energy-dissipating devices rather than with conventional anchors. Case studies of two tanks are presented—one broad and one slender tank, both anchored with torsional-beam steel dampers, which dissipate seismic energy by inelastic deformations induced by uplifting of the tank wall. Numerical results show that tanks anchored with steel dampers experience significantly less foundation overturning moment than similar fully anchored tanks. Relative to unanchored tanks, the tanks anchored with steel dampers experience small values of base uplift, plastic rotation at the plate boundary, hoop stress in the wall, and radial separation between the plate and foundation. In general, tanks anchored with dampers exhibit performance superior to that of similar unanchored or fully anchored tanks. Due to savings in the material of tank wall, foundation, and full base anchorage, the use of energy dissipating anchors is likely to be cost-effective.

AB - A stress resultant plasticity-based formulation with shear failure criteria and post-shear failure effects is presented for modeling the response of nonductile reinforced concrete bridge columns subjected to biaxial seismic loading. The formulation consists of a single component model, in which plastic hinges exist at each end of an elastic beam-column. Deterioration in column strength following a shear failure, kinematic flexural strain hardening, and degradation of elastic unloading stiffness under cyclic load reversal are accounted for in the hinges' force-deformation relationships. The degradation of the transverse shear strength in a reinforced concrete column's flexural plastic hinge zone is also accounted for. The formulation is shown to predict reasonably well the cyclic response of nonductile beam-column experimental test specimens that develop either ductile flexural yielding, a brittle shear failure, or a ductile shear failure in the flexural plastic hinge zone when subjected to uniaxial or biaxial nonproportional cyclic lateral loading. Inelastic seismic time-history analysis is also presented to illustrate the significance of including nonductile effects in a model of a bridge structure susceptible to column shear failure during an earthquake.

AB - Most seismic codes specify empirical formulas to estimate the fundamental vibration period of buildings. Evaluated first in this paper are the formulas specified in present U.S. codes using the available data on the fundamental period of buildings “measured” from their motions recorded during eight California earthquakes, starting with the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and ending with the 1994 Northridge earthquake. It is shown that current code formulas for estimating the fundamental period of concrete shear wall buildings are grossly inadequate. Subsequently, an improved formula is developed by calibrating a theoretical formula, derived using Dunkerley's method, against the measured period data through regression analysis. Also recommended is a factor to limit the period calculated by a “rational” analysis, such as Rayleigh's method.

AB - Seismic soil-pile-structure interaction has been an area of limited research, and most of the existing work adopts the conventional approach of soil-structure interaction analyses in which the problem is solved by superposition of kinematic and inertial interaction. This multistep approach is often time consuming. The present study focuses on a coupled finite element–boundary element type approach, where the entire problem domain is solved in a single pass. The problem is cast in the frequency domain and a substructured method of analysis is adopted by interfacing the superstructure and the foundation at the foundation cap level. The free-field seismic response is calculated by an equivalent-linear method that is widely used. The formulation allows for multiple supports with varying excitations. Coupling of the problem allows one to construct transfer functions for various degrees of freedom in the structure including the effects of interaction. A number of examples presented in this paper demonstrate the utility of the method in solving problems involving bridge piers and building frames.

AB - We report results that lend support to the hypothesis that extreme hurricane wind speeds are described predominantly by reverse Weibull distributions, which have limited upper tails. This is consistent with the result reported recently in the atmospheric sciences literature that, on physical grounds, hurricanes have finite maximum intensity. The sampling errors typical of our results are controlled by the relatively short length of the historical record (about one hundred years, i.e., a few tens of hurricane events for any one location) and are, in practice, independent of whether the size of the simulated data samples for any specified location is of the order of 1,000 or larger. According to our estimates, mean recurrence intervals of wind speeds corresponding to nominal ultimate wind loads specified in the ASCE standard 7-95 for extratropical storm regions on the one hand, and hurricane-prone regions on the other, are mutually inconsistent with respect to risk.

AB - Many structures with extended spans undergo the flow-induced oscillation commonly called vortex shedding. In the case of long-span bridges, Ehsan and Scanlan, employing basic data from deck section wind tunnel model tests, offered a nonlinear theoretical framework for predicting maximum vortex-induced amplitude under the lock-in condition. The present paper replaces the Ehsan-Scanlan model with a linearized form that brings it into conformity with the familiar flutter derivative expressions now commonly used in bridge wind-stability analyses. The essential new addition is an active sinusoidal lift term. Converting some of the Ehsan-Scanlan experimental section data to the new form, the suggested replacement model successfully reidentifies the range of original Tacoma Narrows vortex-induced response amplitudes that were experimentally obtained by Farquharson on a full-bridge model. Either vertical or torsional motions at vortex lock-in can be assayed by the method discussed.

The former approach does not properly reflect the actual behavior of wood stressed in shear in elements of structural size. The process of deriving a resistance factor for probabilistic-based design is described. The inadequacy of the current target safety index values in the México City building code is briefly discussed.

AB - Elliptical rolling rods between the base and foundation of a structure provide a new base isolation system. Herein, the effectiveness of elliptical rolling rods for isolating a multistory building against earthquake forces is investigated. A theoretical formulation for obtaining seismic response of a multistory building supported on elliptical rolling rods is developed. Due to the nonlinear force-deformation behavior of elliptical rolling rods, the seismic response of the system is obtained using an iterative numerical integration technique. The effectiveness of elliptical rolling rods is studied by comparing the response between isolated and corresponding fixed base systems for different eccentricities of the rods. It is shown that elliptical rolling rods are quite effective in reducing the seismic response of the system without undergoing large base displacements.
