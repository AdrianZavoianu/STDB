AB - Many of the fractures observed in welded moment connections after the Northridge earthquake propagated through the column flange either as a divot or completely through the column section. The effect, if any, of through-thickness properties on the performance of beam-to-column connections used in moment frames could not be defined. To define this effect, the through-thickness properties of steels, along with other factors related to fabrication and design, need to be established. This paper presents an analysis of through-thickness properties of plate and structural shape steel products. The present investigation shows that the ultimate and yield strengths in the longitudinal and transverse directions were essentially identical. An increase in data scatter is observed when the longitudinal or transverse ultimate strengths are compared with the through-thickness values. These observations are true also for the tensile yield strengths. The reduction of area is highest in the longitudinal direction, followed by the transverse direction, and least in the through-thickness direction. The through-thickness reduction-of-area data exhibit large scatter and do not exhibit any relationship to the longitudinal or transverse properties.

AB - In conventional frame analysis, the behavior of beam-to-column connections is treated as either pinned or rigid joints. In recent years, extensive theoretical and experimental work has produced accurate connection models as well as good design methods. However, these methods are complex and their applications are cumbersome. Thus, practical design of partially restrained (PR) frames (Type PR Construction) is seldom made in engineering practice, even though it can offer a more realistic and rational design approach. This paper provides a practical method for the design of Type PR construction for design office use.

AB - A new classification system for beam-to-column connections is proposed in terms of the boundary between rigid and semirigid connections. Some typical subassemblages of multistory frames are chosen to consider the layout and member details of the structural systems in the classification. The connection model used for this classification is the power model proposed by Kishi and Chen. In this connection model, the connection curves for the respective connection types can be determined by their initial stiffness and ultimate moment capacity. The boundary between rigid and semirigid connections is established in terms of these two parameters by taking into account the elastic-plastic behaviors of the structural assemblages at the serviceability limit state along with the ultimate limit state. Furthermore, the required rotational capacity is calculated for the connections classified as rigid. The validity of the proposed classification system is examined by analyzing the overall behavior of semirigid frames. As a result, it is confirmed that the new classification criteria provides a more rational boundary compared with the existing classification systems.

AB - This paper describes an experimental program on walls formed from two skins of profiled steel sheeting and an in-fill of concrete. Twenty full-scale tests are reported, which include samples where both axial forces and bending moments are applied. It is shown that the axial load capacity is less than the squash load capacity calculated using current codes of practice. This is due to the early buckling of the thin steel sheeting and the difficulty in transferring the applied load between the components. A practical device is developed that provides improved load transfer. Modifications to the code methods are proposed to enable a closer prediction of the test behavior. The early steel buckling and poor load transfer also effect the out-of-plane bending capacity of the system; however, the excellent bending stiffness of the walls makes it possible to provide a very slender wall thickness.

AB - The rotational stiffness of bolted connections can be properly predicted by means of the so-called “component method.” In this method, the T-stub plays a fundamental role, because it is used to compute the stiffness contribution of the most important joint components. For this reason, an experimental analysis on bolted T-stub assemblies has been performed. On the basis of this analysis, the possibility of predicting the axial stiffness of the T-stub assembly is investigated. In addition, as the joint behavior is strongly influenced by the bolt preloading, the experimental analysis has been performed applying three different levels of bolt preloading and, starting from the obtained experimental results, simple rules to take it into account are suggested. Finally, the reliability of the relationships derived from the T-stub analysis has been verified through the application of the component method to the prediction of the rotational stiffness of a wide number of tested specimens concerning extended end plate connections, both with snug-tightened and pretensioned bolts, collected in the technical literature.

AB - The effects of chord axial compressive stress on the ultimate strength of a DT joint subjected to brace compression have been studied both experimentally and numerically. Three experimental load cases were considered, one with brace compression only and the other two with different chord axial stress. Two methods were used in the numerical work to apply the chord and brace loadings: (1) Proportional loading; and (2) nonproportional loading. The former method was adopted in the experimental work. The results confirmed that the ultimate strength of DT joints can be reduced significantly when chord axial stress is present. Nonlinear finite-element (FE) analysis on the joints was found to overestimate ultimate loads, especially for high chord loads. A comparison between the current results and the API design rules has shown that, even with the two safety factors removed, the API equation gives ultimate brace compression loads that are conservative up to chord utilization values of ∼0.5.

AB - Although longitudinal plates have been used widely to connect braces and other attachments to hollow structural sections (HSS), there is no established design method available for this type of connection. Research work has been undertaken both experimentally and analytically to produce a rational design procedure. Specimens with different angles between branch plates and HSS have been tested to rupture under different levels of compression loads on the HSS members. A parametric study, covering 120 different cases, has been carried out using finite element models, and the influences of plate-to-HSS angle, HSS axial force, HSS wall slenderness, plate thickness, plate width, and plate loading case have been investigated. Yield line theory was also used for the analysis of the strength of such connections. From this research work, design guidelines have been created based on an ultimate deformation limit and a serviceability deformation limit for the HSS connecting face, and non-uniformly distributed stress in the plate.

AB - New riveted steel structures have not been built in the past several decades. As a consequence, less attention has been paid to their fatigue life behavior than to structures containing contemporary fastening elements such as bolts or welds. The behavior of riveted members is a matter of considerable interest, however. For example, it is obvious that the life of the large stock of riveted bridges that still exist must be extended, at the same time maintaining a satisfactory level of safety. Evaluation of the remaining fatigue life of riveted structures has been impeded by the lack of a reasonable database of test results from full-size riveted members. Recent work in both North America and Europe has addressed the need for better fatigue life data for riveted members. The paper reports on the writers' research and that of others into the fatigue resistance of riveted members. The results of tests on full-size flexural members and on axially loaded members are reported, and these test results are compared with the design recommendations of several North American and European standards. Recommendations are presented for a fatigue life classification for assessment of riveted shear splices.

AB - Cold formed structural members are fabricated from sheet steels that must meet various material requirements prescribed in applicable national design standards. These requirements ensure that 1) stress concentrations can be redistributed and 2) members and connections can undergo a minimum amount of displacement without a loss in structural performance. The 1996 Australian/New Zealand AS/NZS 4600 and both North American cold formed steel design standards, CSA-S136 and AISI, allow for the use of thin (t&lt; 0.9 mm in AS/NZS 4600), high strength (fy= 550 MPa) sheet steels if the yield stress and ultimate strength are reduced to 75% of their minimum specified values. This paper provides a summary of results detailing the behavior of bolted connections tested in shear, which were composed of 0.42 mm G550, 0.60 mm G550, and 0.60 mm G300 sheet steels (to the 1993 Australian standard AS 1397). Recommendations concerning the adequacy of current design standards with respect to the design of thin sheet steel bolted connections are made, along with the calibration of applicable limit states resistance equations for the three observed modes of failure: end pull-out, bearing, and net section fracture.

AB - In this paper, the shear stiffness in the weaker direction of Z-core sandwich panels is studied. The recurrence condition is assumed, and the shear stiffness is derived from the first principle. The contact interaction between the facing plates and the flanges of the Z-sections is considered. Compatibility equations and the shear strain of a typical segment are obtained from the Principle of Virtual Work. Formulas for the shear stiffness in the weaker direction are derived explicitly. It is shown that there are two shear stiffness values associated with the Z-core sandwich panels, depending on the direction of the shear force. The stronger value of a typical panel can be 60% higher than the weaker value. To verify this phenomenon experimentally, two steel sandwich panels with different stiffener spacing were fabricated and tested. Good agreement was obtained between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results.

AB - Analytical aspects of structural identification are discussed considering different types of models, different model calibration spaces, and different types and amounts of experimental information. Three-dimensional finite element models and 2D grid models of an operating highway bridge are developed. The models were calibrated by taking advantage of an extensive database of experimental information accumulated from the bridge. Different types of models of varying sizes permit comparison of automated optimized calibration and manual calibration approaches. The experimental data collected characterizes both the local and global behavior of the structure. Modal data acquired with high temporal and spatial resolutions, and instrumented monitoring data describing local and global responses from static and moving truck-load configurations were used to investigate the requisite quantity, quality, and attributes of experimental data that should be considered for analytical modeling and for choosing a model calibration strategy. It is shown that modal updating and calibration must be carried out in both modal and flexibility spaces, and further, that a certain amount of experimental local and global behavior information must be included to accomplish this task. In spite of the difficulties associated with analyzing and calibrating the large 3D finite element models, they performed better in representing the overall properties and responses of the structure. While the 2D grid models are more suitable for automated calibration, given their smaller size and faster computational attributes, their validity in representing the properties of the structure needs further exploration.

AB - This study demonstrates the feasibility of using multilayer feedforward neural networks to model the complicated nonlinear relationship between the various input parameters associated with reinforced concrete columns and the actual ultimate capacity of the column. The neural network models were constructed directly from a fairly comprehensive set of experimental results and were found to be tolerant of certain levels of errors in the original testing results. Comparison with the original testing data and theoretical model showed that the ultimate capacity of reinforced concrete columns predicted by the neural network models is reasonably accurate. Parametric analysis indicates that the neural network model has reasonably captured the behavior of reinforced concrete columns. Numerical studies are conducted to investigate modeling issues such as different data scaling schemes and dimensionless representation schemes. Nonlinear transformation of the output values resulted in an overall improvement in the generalization capabilities of the neural network model. Preliminary studies using a limited data set of 54 test results on high strength concrete columns also showed promising results. The neural network model can be useful in checking routine designs because it provides instantaneous results once it is properly trained and tested.

AB - The existence of openings in diaphragms causes concentration of shear forces around the openings and the generation of axial forces in the framing. In 1981, the Applied Technology Council developed the only guidelines for designing diaphragms with openings. The procedure for determining the shear around the opening, however, is complicated and has not been experimentally verified. Accordingly, simplified equations for determining the shear forces in diaphragms with openings are derived in this paper. The application of the membrane-to-brace replacement method to diaphragms is also discussed. Horizontal loading tests are conducted on three floor diaphragms designed to the same load. The ultimate loads are almost the same, regardless of the existence of the opening. The observed unit shear around the opening is close to the calculated value. The observed deflection is smaller than the value calculated on the basis of the nominal stiffness for the materials and the fasteners by 14–28%. It can be said from these results that all the methods perform well as a practical design tool.

AB - The compressive stress required to cause initial local buckling of a flat element is related to a “normalized slenderness.” This value is used in a normalized buckling curve, appropriate to the material, to give the normalized buckling stress. Flat elements supported on the two long edges possess postbuckling strength, which is obtained by taking the square root of the normalized initial buckling stress to give an “effective strength.” This “effective strength” replaces the yield strength in the design of columns in which local buckling affects overall flexural buckling, and it is used as the limiting extreme fiber stress in beam-columns. “Effective strength” may be interpreted as an “effective thickness” or, less conveniently as an “effective width.” Uniform and gradient compressive stresses and shear stress are treated. Comparisons are made with current code requirements.
