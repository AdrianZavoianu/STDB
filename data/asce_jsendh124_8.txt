AB - This paper presents the experimental results from a large research project dealing with the seismic behavior of semirigid steel frames. The investigation focuses on the performance of steel frames with semirigid connections comprised of top, seat, and web angles in comparison with fully rigid alternatives. The experimental program includes monotonic, cyclic, and pseudodynamic tests. Results from eight tests on two-story frames are discussed, and the effects of connection stiffness and capacity on frame response are assessed. In addition, a comparison between the behavior of frames with bolted semirigid and fully welded rigid connections is carried out under realistic seismic loading conditions. It is shown that the type of the bolted connection used in this study exhibits sufficient ductility and stable hysteretic behavior and that connection yielding is a viable alternative to the weak-beam strong-column design. It is also indicated that with appropriate design and careful consideration of the dynamic characteristics of semirigid frames, adequate response to earthquake loads may be achieved, even in areas of high seismicity.

AB - The 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake precipitated numerous unexpected fractures in welded steel moment-resisting frame connections, mainly in the regions of the bottom girder flanges. This two-part paper reports on research to determine if structural phenomena, primarily the effect of composite concrete floor slabs, contributed substantially to these failures. The results of cyclic experiments of one bare steel and two composite full-scale specimens representing typical pre-Northridge, interior moment-resisting connections are described, along with corroborating analyses. The structural performance of the test specimens is highlighted in this paper. The connections failed either brittlely at the welded interface of the bottom girder flange and the column flange, or with a low cycle fatigue failure emanating from the root of the bottom girder flange access hole. None of the connections achieved adequate levels of cyclic ductility, and the composite connections did not achieve their calculated strengths when subjected to positive bending moment. In the companion paper, the behavior of the connections and the structural phenomena that contributed to the failures are documented.

AB - This two-part paper presents research to determine the effect of structural phenomena, especially the presence of composite concrete floor slabs, on the behavior of the type of fully-restrained, steel moment-resisting frame connections that failed, primarily near the bottom girder flanges, during the 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake. In a companion paper, the results of three experiments, including one bare steel specimen and two with composite floor slabs, are outlined, along with corroborating analyses. In this paper, the structural phenomena that affected the behavior of these connections are documented. The results indicate that the strains near the bottom flange of the specimens with a slab are several times larger than those near the top flange, and that strain concentrations and a triaxial state of tensile stress precipitate failure in these connection topologies. These results help to explain the predominance of bottom flange failures, and they indicate that the potentially high strain levels leading to fracture and the inherently unsymmetrical topology of composite steel frame connections should be considered in the development of connection design provisions.

AB - A design criterion is proposed for the seismic reinforcement of masonry stuctures by joining shear walls with steel X-bracing. The seismic response of the coupled system was investigated in the time domain by a step-by-step integration. Two suitable mechanical models for the shear walls and the X-bracing were used. A wide parametric analysis was performed varying the mechanical characteristics of the masonry walls as well as the X-bracing. Using 20 simulated ground motions the uncertainties related to the definition of seismic loading were taken into account. The results obtained established a structural design criterion based on the equivalent static lateral force method. Given this criterion, the structural factor of the steel X-bracing had to be reduced. This reduction was necessary due to the mixed matched interaction of the two different seismic behaviors. The reduction was based on a suitable coefficient, named the “coupling parameter.” This coefficient is given in specific graphs proposed for design purposes.

AB - This paper describes an experimental program to investigate the in-plane seismic behavior of steel frames with unreinforced masonry infills having large window openings. Test parameters included the masonry pier width and the number of wythes. Infill strength and stiffness deterioration seemed to be independent of the pier width or the number of wythes. Results indicate that the ultimate shear strength of these infills ranged between 0.82 and 1.08 MPa (120 and 157 psi). Stiffness deterioration for each infill was almost identical. By 0.20% drift each infill lost more than 70% of its original effective stiffness, with the remaining stiffness degrading by 2.0% drift. Ductility of these tested masonry infills depended on the pier width and the number of wythes. Narrow piers tended to be more ductile than wide piers, resulting in less observable damage in the brick at large-amplitude drifts. Similarly, the double wythe infills tended to be more ductile than single wythe infills. This research was directed toward possible use in the evaluation methodologies of ATC-33.

AB - New analysis and design procedures have been developed for the performance-based seismic rehabilitation of buildings. Such procedures require accurate estimates to be made of displacements, velocities, and accelerations. Nonlinear response-history analysis of single-degree-of-freedom oscillators, having varying values of yield strength and post-yield stiffness and using 20 velocity-scaled earthquake ground motions, was undertaken to verify the accuracy of the proposed displacement-estimation procedures that make use of relations between inelastic and elastic displacements. Near-field earthquake records were not considered. The assumption that mean inelastic displacements are approximately equal to mean elastic displacements is reasonable for oscillators with strength ratios greater than 0.20 and elastic periods greater than the characteristic site period. For other values of the strength ratio and elastic period, the assumption is nonconservative. Mean-plus-one-standard-deviation inelastic displacements are approximately equal to 1.5 times mean inelastic displacements for elastic periods greater than 0.3 s.

AB - In this paper, a procedure for developing the duration-dependent inelastic seismic design spectrum is proposed. The approach assumes that the lateral strength of the structure can be increased to compensate for the increased number of inelastic cycles that may be imposed on the structure under a long duration ground motion. Seismic input energy is considered as a part of the demand on the structure, and an empirical prediction of the seismic input energy in terms of the ground motion duration is made. Seismic design is established by requiring the structure to have a cyclic plastic strain energy capacity that is larger or equal to the portion of the seismic input energy contributing to cumulative damage. The plastic strain energy capacity of the structure is calculated using an energy-based cumulative damage model. Results from this study indicated that an increase in the lateral strength demand can be expected for an increase in the duration of the ground motion, and the increase in lateral strength is largest near the characteristic period of the ground motion. The strength deterioration parameter that characterizes the plastic strain energy capacity of the structure has been found to have a significant influence on the duration-dependent inelastic seismic design spectrum.

AB - This paper presents a Bayesian statistical analysis method for updating earthquake ground motion versus damage relationships in the form of fragility curves and for estimating confidence bounds on these fragility curves. As building damage data from past earthquakes become increasingly available, these data need to be combined with analytical fragility curves to arrive at more robust fragility curves. The Bayesian method provides a technique for updating these relationships. The parameters of analytical fragility curves are used to estimate the prior distributions of damage in the Bayesian analysis. In an earlier paper, Singhal and Kiremidjian presented a general methodology for the development of analytical motion-damage relationships in terms of seismic fragility curves and damage probability matrices. Data on building damage are used to estimate the likelihood functions. The Bayesian method for fragility analysis is illustrated by using the damage data on reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings from the January 17, 1994 Northridge, Calif. earthquake. The uncertainties in the fragility curves are represented by confidence bounds around the median fragility curves.

AB - Dynamic testing was performed on a highly skewed, three-span, seismically isolated, prestressed concrete, slab-on-girder bridge. The pullback, quick-release method of testing was used, a first for this bridge type. Several new developments facilitated the quick-release testing. A simple new quick-release mechanism was employed with relatively low lateral test force. Also, a new method of attaching the pullback cable to the bridge was implemented. After testing, a three-dimensional finite element model of the bridge was created. An optimization program was used to refine, or calibrate, the model to match experimentally determined natural frequencies and mode shapes. This automated, systematic optimization of model parameters produced an accurate analytical representation of the bridge. Mode shapes and frequencies from the experimental and analytical investigations are presented.

AB - Many steel bridges have suffered diaphragm (cross frame) damage during recent earthquakes. Diaphragms provide an important load path for the seismically induced loads acting on slab-on-girder steel bridges, but their impact on seismic response is still unclear in many ways. The relative role played by intermediate and end diaphragms in providing lateral load resistance, along with the consequences of diaphragm damage on bridge seismic response, has not been studied. This paper quantitatively investigates the impact of diaphragms on the seismic response of straight slab-on-girder steel bridges. Typical 20 to 60 m span slab-on-girder bridges with and without diaphragms are considered and studied through elastic and inelastic static push-over analyses. Two hand-calculation analytical models are proposed to evaluate their period, elastic response, and pseudospectral acceleration at first yielding. It is shown that a small end-diaphragm stiffness is sufficient to make the entire superstructure behave as a unit in the elastic range. However, a dramatic shift in seismic behavior occurs once an end diaphragm fractures, with a sizable period elongation, considerably larger lateral displacements, and higher propensity to damage owing to P-Δ effects. It is also found that the presence of intermediate diaphragms does not significantly influence the seismic performance of these types of bridges, in either the elastic or the inelastic range.

AB - The effects of non-uniform excitation on short bridges were studied by computing the response of an idealized bridge to a suite of earthquake ground motions. The ground motions for each support were developed from seven measured ground motions and from idealizations of wave passage and coherency loss effects. For each set of support motions and for a range of bridge lengths and periods, the maximum support reactions were compared with the reactions calculated for coherent motions. For variable support motion, the contribution of the antisymmetric modes tended to increase, whereas the contribution of the symmetric modes generally decreased. Consequently, the dynamic component of the end support reaction computed using coherency loss excitation exceeded the response to coherent excitation for 62% of the bridges considered, varying from 75–180% of the coherent response. In contrast, the dynamic component of the central support reaction, which is affected only by symmetric modes, was unconservatively predicted in only 20% of the cases. Based on these observations, a method that relies on modifying the modal participation factor was developed for incorporating the effects of multisupport excitations into coherent response calculations.

AB - The purpose of the present study is to propose an improved damage detection and assessment algorithm based on the method of system identification. In this approach, the complete sets of modes or displacements are not needed since the error function involves only the differences between components of those vectors. The present approach allows the use of composite data, which consist of static displacements and eigenmodes. In the dynamic test, the curvature and slope of mode shapes are introduced to formulate the error responses. Using these techniques, a parametric study is conducted and the effectiveness of the method is discussed. Generally, the developed algorithm is also able to detect and assess damages in a structure when the measured data are sparse. To examine the capability of the proposed damage assessment algorithm, a series of tests for a predetermined damaged two-span continuous beam and a planar bowstring truss structure are performed. The comparisons of proposed theory with test data show good agreement. The most clear effect of the algorithm is that the combination of the curvature or slope of mode shape and the static displacement data gives the most promising results for damage detection and assessment. The proposed method can be effectively used to detect and assess possible damage in a structure.

AB - Some transmission structures exhibit important geometric and material nonlinearities that should be considered in their analysis and design. Unless simplifying assumptions are made, reliability analysis of these structures is complex and can be very computer-time intensive. This paper describes an approximate method to conduct reliability analysis of nonlinear transmission structures. It is shown that for most transmission structures, the design point is close to the 50-year return period loads. Using this result, approximate g-functions for nonlinear problems are obtained with minimum computational effort. It is also shown that when the material strengths are highly correlated, g-functions that include interaction of axial load and bending moments may be reduced to g-functions with no interaction. These simplifying results are implemented in a microcomputer program, RELIAB, which can handle complex transmission structures such as large latticed structures, tension-only structures, or structures that exhibit nonlinearities. RELIAB's accuracy is ascertained by comparing results with another computer program, TRANSREL, which accounts for the residual strength of latticed towers following progressive failure of one or more components.

AB - Flutter analysis in aircraft or bridge engineering has to include motion-induced aerodynamic forces. These forces are mathematically described in two equivalent ways, namely, by real number or complex number expressions. Accordingly, flutter analysis can be performed using either real or complex arithmetic. At first glance, the use of either kind of notation seems to be more a question of personal preference, as both lead to the same numerical results. Nevertheless, this paper attempts to advocate the use of complex notation both in aircraft and bridge flutter analysis. Real-number and complex-number descriptions of the same mechanical phenomena are compared. It is shown that, apart from computational advantages, complex notation leads to mathematically more compact and more elegant expressions, which is of significance particularly from an educational standpoint.
