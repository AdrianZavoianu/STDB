AB - Traditional timber connections with wood pegs are encountered in the renovation and rehabilitation of historic wood structures and in the construction of new structures where rustic appearance and traditional methods are desired. This study examined four types of traditional connections: mortise and tenon, mortise and tenon with a shoulder, mortise and tenon with a shoulder and a knee brace, and fork and tongue. A total of 60 specimens, primarily white oak and Douglas fir, were tested. About a quarter of the specimens were assembled and allowed to season under simulated in-service load. All specimens were tested under simulated gravity load up to failure or to about five times typical design load. Some knee-braced specimens were retested to simulate lateral loads. Test results showed that joint behavior is primarily linear. A tightly fitting joint carries load with less peg damage than a loose joint allows. A mortise and tenon with a shoulder performs better than a mortise and tenon or a fork and tongue. At typical occupancy sustained live plus dead load levels, the effects of warping and checking caused by drying shrinkage overshadow any damage caused by the sustained load. Analysis of structures employing these connections requires that the behavior of the wood-pegged joints be included in a reasonable manner. In frames without knee braces, the joints can be modeled as pinned connections. In frames with knee braces, the post-to-beam and knee-brace connections can be modeled as pinned, although the reduction in effective axial stiffness of the knee brace caused by the wood pegs must be included. The effects of shear deformations should be incorporated into the analysis.

AB - This paper reports the test results from a study investigating the influence of openings on the lateral resistance of wood-based shear walls built with both standard and oversize oriented strand board panels under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. Test results showed that the application of nonstandard oversize panels significantly improved the performance of the perforated shear walls compared with standard 1.2 × 2.4 m panels. Door and window openings caused a significant decrease in the strength and stiffness of the walls and precipitated a change in failure mode, especially for walls with oversize panels. Although nail failure modes were commonly observed in walls without openings, a combination of nail and panel failures were observed in shear walls with openings. A newly proposed cyclic test protocol was used that consisted of fewer but more severe displacement excursions, compared with many other test protocols. This was believed to better reflect typical earthquake excitation and avoid low cycle nail fatigue failures, which were observed previously with long sequence cyclic test protocols.

AB - Several proposed design criteria for preventing annoying wood floor vibrations are reviewed, and an additional criterion is proposed. Recent research results that validate the proposed design criterion are reported. The recent research includes laboratory constructed floors, floors in buildings under construction, and floors in occupied buildings. Some of the floors included in the “under construction” or “unoccupied” results were revisited after the buildings were occupied to determine if the occupancy loads affected the proposed design criterion. In this paper, the terms “occupied” and “unoccupied” refer to whether furniture and other live loads typically associated with living in the structure are present or not. The results validate that if the stiffness of the floors is sufficient to keep the fundamental frequency of the floor system above 15 Hz for unoccupied floors, and above 14 Hz for occupied floors, acceptable vibration will be obtained. The design criterion is intended to be used during the design of buildings with allowable design properties to ensure performance of the floors after construction.

AB - The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the difference between the rigid-floor and flexible-floor analyses of buildings. The finite-element method is used to analyze the buildings with and without shear walls. From a number of response-spectrum analyses, the rigid-floor model was found to be accurate enough for regular and nonregular buildings without shear walls. However, the difference between the rigid-floor and flexible-floor analyses can be large for the buildings with shear walls. Thus, an error formula is generated using the regression analysis of the rigid-floor and flexible-floor analyses from 520 rectangular, U-shaped, and T-shaped buildings. Using this formula, one can estimate the error of the structural analysis of a building with shear walls when the rigid-floor assumption is used.

AB - This paper presents a detailed investigation into the contribution of plasterboard to the lateral resistance of cold-formed steel-framed residential structures. It details the development of a finite-element model for laterally loaded plasterboard-lined cold-formed steel wall frames for residential construction. The model utilizes nonlinear element properties and three-dimensional geometrical configurations and is capable of simulating the influence of boundary conditions such as corner return walls and ceiling cornices. The analytical results from the finite-element model were successfully verified against experimental racking test results. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the model to study the influence of return walls, ceiling cornices, and wall length on the lateral capacity of the wall system. It is concluded that a wall with corner return walls, ceiling cornices, and skirting boards has more than three times the lateral capacity of an identical isolated wall panel. The relationship between the wall length and the ultimate lateral load-carrying capacity of the wall system is dependent on the presence of these boundary conditions.

AB - The buckling strength of conical shells subjected to axial compression may be increased by means of meridional stiffeners (stringers). Unlike stiffened cylinders, only limited research has been carried out and no design provisions exist for stringer-stiffened cones. In this paper, a design procedure for such cones is developed based on an equivalent cylinder approach. Design criteria for both local (shell panel) and global (stiffened panel) buckling modes are proposed. In the absence of experimental results, a numerical parametric study is then presented to assess the design proposal. By using finite-element models, linear and nonlinear analyses are performed to quantify critical design aspects and to calibrate buckling strength predictions derived from the design proposal.

AB - It has been observed from test and analysis results that the differential deflection between girders in a slab-on-girder bridge deck reduces the negative bending moments in the deck slab. A simplified analysis method considering the effect of girder deflection is developed, based on an analytical solution obtained with the elastic plate theory. With this approach, the effects of the girder stiffness and spacing, and the span length of the bridge on the maximum negative bending moments in a deck slab can be assessed. The simplified analysis method is validated with finite-element models. It has been shown that the maximum negative bending moment in a bridge deck can be accurately evaluated with the proposed method.

AB - Flutter and buffeting are both issues of utmost concern in the wind-resistant design of long-span bridges. Multimode flutter and buffeting analysis of the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge, which is the world's longest suspension bridge with a center span of 1,991 m, were performed, and the analytical results were compared with wind-tunnel test data obtained from an aeroelastic full model of the bridge. The multimode flutter analysis was in good agreement with the measurements and exhibited a significant coupling among modes. The multimode buffeting analysis also showed excellent agreement between the analysis and measurements in vertical and torsional response. However, for reasons likely associated with the assessment of lateral aerodynamic damping, the analysis overestimated lateral response. Significant coupling among modes was also observed in the buffeting analysis, and the multimode analysis predicted the measurement better than an alternate single-mode analysis method.

AB - Steel bridges are frequently supported by seismically vulnerable substructures, as clearly demonstrated by recent earthquakes. The seismic retrofit of these nonductile substructures can be, in many cases, a rather costly operation. This paper investigates the adequacy of a seismic retrofit strategy that relies instead on ductile end-diaphragms inserted in the steel superstructure: the objective is to protect the substructure by replacing the steel diaphragms over abutments and piers with specially designed ductile diaphragms calibrated to yield before the strength of the substructure is reached. For a type of steel slab-on-girder bridge widely found in North America, this paper presents simplified analytical models as well as a step-by-step design procedure developed for three types of ductile diaphragm systems (such as shear panels, eccentrically braced frames, and triangular-plate added damping and stiffness devices), followed by results from nonlinear inelastic analyses conducted to investigate the seismic behavior of these retrofitted bridges. At this time, only bridges on stiff substructure are considered, although a few examples are presented to illustrate the potential inadequacy of this retrofit approach for bridges on flexible substructures.

AB - The effects of redundancy on the probability of structural failure are analyzed, emphasizing relationships with the over-strength and ductility ratios. The introductory remarks make reference to the difficulties that exist in defining and quantifying the effects of redundancy in the particular context of earthquake-resistant design. Two different definitions of redundancy are proposed. These definitions are used to evaluate the effects of redundancy on the probability of structural failure in each of the four following cases: (1) strength-based design and critical regions [plastic hinges (PHs)] with infinite deformation capacity; (2) strength-based design and critical regions (PHs) with finite deformation capacity; (3) displacement-based design and critical regions (PHs) with finite deformation capacity; and (4) energy-based design. The results obtained in these analyses lead to the conclusion that, although redundancy can result in several beneficial effects on the earthquake response, a component of the reduction factor R due to redundancy (RR), as suggested in recent publications, cannot be established independently of the over-strength and ductility of the structural system. Furthermore, to take advantage of the redundancy based on its “probabilistic effect,” it is necessary: (1) to decrease the coefficient of variation of the demand relatively to the coefficient of variation of the supplied capacity; (2) to increase the over-strength; (3) to increase the plastic rotation capacity, i.e., the ductility; and (4) to guarantee a minimal rotation capacity in all members of the structural system so that they can follow the displacement of the structure without failure and allow other elements to dissipate the earthquake input energy.

AB - Following the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the areas with a high density of reported breaks in water pipes in typical residential areas in San Fernando Valley and in Los Angeles often did not coincide with the areas having a high density of severely damaged (red-tagged) buildings. As the former is an indicator of large strains and nonlinear soil response, this observation suggests that the damage to buildings in some areas may have been smaller than expected because the soil dissipated part of the energy of the ground motion by nonlinear response. This paper presents an attempt to quantify this relationship between the density of red-tagged buildings, N (per km2), and the severity of shaking (via peak horizontal ground velocity, vmax, or modified Mercalli intensity, IMM), including the density of breaks in water pipes, n (per km2), as a variable specifying the level of strain in the soil. Approximate empirical relationships for N = f(vmax, n) and N = f(IMM, n) are presented. The trends in the data indicate that, for vmax in the range from ∼35 to ∼125 cm/s, the rate of growth of N versus vmax tends to decrease at sites with large strain in the soil (i.e., large n). For vmax beyond ∼150 cm/s, the beneficial effects of nonlinear soil response seem to fade out, as large differential motions associated with soil failure begin to contribute to the damage of structures. Assuming fairly uniform density and quality of building stock and of water pipes in the areas studied, the derived relationships are then used to map vmax and IMM in San Fernando Valley and in Los Angeles. The resulting maps are more detailed than what could be obtained from the density of strong motion stations and of sites with reports on felt intensity.

AB - In this paper, a new treatment of load uncertainties in structural problems based on fuzzy set theory is introduced. A fuzzy finite-element method (FFEM) for treating uncertain loads in static structural problems is developed. First, the problem is discretized, which results in a system of fuzzy algebraic equations. An efficient algorithm for calculating guaranteed inclusions for the solution of such fuzzy systems is implemented. In the case of uncertain loading, the resulting system of equations is linear, and only the right-hand side vector contains fuzzy values. Solutions due to all load combinations, as a special case of load uncertainties, can be obtained by a single computation, leading to a set of possible displacement values corresponding to all loading cases. In conventional analysis, due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, calculating a possible structural response for all possible loading combinations becomes computationally intractable for typical structures. Examples show that the possible interval values calculated using FFEM provide a sharp bound on possible nodal displacements and element forces calculated by combinatorial calculation of all loading conditions. Thus the extreme values of element forces for all loading combinations can be calculated using FFEM. Comparison of the extreme values of element forces with typical design loading schemes show that the current design procedures can lead to nonconservative predictions of element forces. The method therefore is applicable to static analysis of any structural system that can be analyzed using finite-element methods.

The soil properties can vary linearly in the vertical direction. The disadvantages of use of the classical Winkler model—those yielding nonconservative values of bending moment and shear forces—are brought out in the paper.
