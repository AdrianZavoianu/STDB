AB - High strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to electro-chemical corrosion have made fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials attractive to civil engineers. This paper presents a study on the beam-column behavior of a high-performance structural member made of concrete-filled FRP tubes (CFFT). The angle-ply FRP tube is a stay-in-place formwork, providing confinement as well as flexural and shear reinforcement. It also acts as a protective jacket for concrete core in harsh environments. A total of five 178 × 178 × 1,320 mm specimens were tested at various combinations of axial and transverse loads to develop a full moment-thrust interaction diagram for the hybrid column. In the compression control region, CFFT columns proved as strong as equivalent conventional reinforced concrete (RC) columns with as high as 6% reinforcement. Failure of CFFTs was ductile, and with considerable warning. Furthermore, toughness and energy-based ductility of CFFTs were quite comparable to those of conventional RC columns. It was also shown that the Euler-Bernouli beam theory is applicable to CFFTs, provided that composite action between the tube and the concrete core is fully developed.

AB - In situ lateral load tests of two bridge bents were conducted on Interstate 15 to determine the strength and ductility of an existing concrete bridge and the improvements that can actually be achieved using a CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced polymer) advanced composite retrofit. The design of the advanced composite retrofit was developed based on rational guidelines for the columns, cap beam, and cap beam-column joints to double the displacement ductility of the as-built bent. The advanced composite was able to strengthen the cap beam-column joints effectively for an increase in shear stresses of 35%, while the peak lateral load capacity was increased by 16%. The displacement ductility was improved from 2.8 for the as-built bent to 6.3 for the retrofitted bent.

AB - High- and very high-strength concretes (HSC and VHSC) are often used for building columns. However, closely spaced hoops are necessary to improve the ductility of such relatively brittle concrete. Such a measure of providing closely spaced transverse reinforcement results in difficulties in concrete placement. This can also present major drawbacks, both regarding assembly control and increased cost associated with required specialized labor. By confining HSC inside a steel circular tube, steel congestion can be avoided while improving concrete behavior and providing more competitive construction cost. The behavior of concrete columns confined inside a steel circular tube has been evaluated when subjected to rapid cycles of compressive loading. Results are compared with those obtained with similar elements subjected to monotonic static loading. The dynamic behavior of confined HSC columns is similar to that of an elastoplastic material where the unloading-reloading branches remain linear and parallel, and the degradation is manifested only through plastic strain. The confined columns are found to be highly capable of absorbing and dissipating energy while featuring a high level of residual strength.

AB - The structural behavior of a framed masonry wall subjected to in-plane monotonic loading is investigated by a full-scale test and the method of discontinuous deformation analysis. The concept of artificial joints is adopted to refine discontinuous deformation analysis so that it can analyze both continuous and discontinuous behavior of the masonry structure. The numerical solutions are compared with experimental results. A satisfactory agreement is obtained. The structural behavior and stress distributions of the framed masonry wall show that the characteristics of the masonry structure is highly influenced by the failure of mortar. In addition, the filled masonry wall affects dominantly the behavior of the framed masonry structure. The partially filled masonry wall induces a short column effect and leads to a severe failure of the column. On the other hand, the completely filled masonry wall increases the stiffness of the structure and the adjacent column fails in the configuration of nearly uniform cracks.

AB - It is well known that the U.S. infrastructure is in need of extensive repair. To ensure that the scarce resources available for maintaining the U.S. bridge inventory are spent in an optimal manner, bridge management programs have been mandated by the Federal Highway Administration. However, these programs are mainly based on data from subjective condition assessments and do not use time-variant bridge reliability for decision making. Many nondestructive test methods exist for the detailed inspection of bridges. Predictions based solely on inspection data may be questionable, particularly if limitations and errors in the measurement methods that are used are not considered. Through the application of Bayesian techniques, information from both inspection data and engineering judgment can be combined and used in a rational manner to better predict future bridge conditions. In this study, the influence of inspection updating on time-variant bridge reliability is illustrated for an existing reinforced concrete bridge. Inspection results are combined with prior information in a Bayesian light. The approach is illustrated for a reinforced concrete bridge located near Pueblo, Colo. For this bridge the effects of corrosion initiation time and rate on time-variant strength are illustrated using simulation. Inspection results are combined with prior information using Bayesian updating. Time-variant bridge reliability computations are performed using a combined technique of adaptive importance sampling and numerical integration. The approach presented allows accounting for inspection results in the quantitative assessment of condition of bridges and shows how to incorporate quantitative information into bridge system and component condition prediction.

AB - The flexural-shear cracking behavior of RC beams was investigated to get a better understanding of the fundamental nature of the shear failure mechanism. Eight RC beams with special features were tested. Each test specimen was fabricated to artificially isolate or add the effect of a certain factor on the critical shear cracking process. Then the test results were directly compared with those of ordinary beams, and the differences were analyzed. To supplement the experimental investigation, the quantitative response of RC beams with varying amounts of cracking was also examined by utilizing a finite-element method incorporated into a fracture mechanics approach. It was found that the localized horizontal shearing action, which is developed right after the formation of the onset of flexural cracking, had a major responsibility for the flexural-shear failure, and that horizontal cracking along the flexural reinforcement was the prerequisite condition for the propagation of the shear crack into the compression zone of the beam. Based on these observations, an hypothesis of a localized horizontal shearing failure mechanism is presented in terms of initiation and propagation of a critical shear crack. This concept leads to a comprehensive description of the causes and processes of flexural-shear failure in slender RC beams.

AB - A numerical study using nonlinear finite-element analysis is performed to investigate the behavior of reinforced-concrete flat plates subject to combined in-plane compressive and out-of-plane floor loads. For the nonlinear finite-element analysis, a computer program addressing material and geometric nonlinearities is developed. The flat plates to be studied are designed according to the direct design method. Through studies on the effects of different load combinations and loading sequence, the load condition that governs the strength of the flat plates is determined. And, for the flat plates under the governing load condition, parametric studies are performed to investigate the variations of the buckling coefficient and the effective flexural rigidity. As a result, this paper provides rational design rules for the moment magnifier method that is applicable to the flat plates.

AB - This paper presents improved analytical methods for simulating the nonlinear static and dynamic response of reinforced concrete frames. A new approach in describing the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of reinforced concrete elements is proposed. This approach consists of isolating the basic mechanisms that control the hysteretic behavior of RC members into individual subelements that are connected in series to form the RC member element. A shear subelement is presented in detail in this paper. It describes the shear sliding in the critical regions and the shear distortion along the member. In cases where a substantial axial force is present, the proposed shear subelement is capable of describing the interaction of axial force with the opening and closing of shear cracks. To establish the validity of the proposed model, correlation studies of analytical results with experimental evidence of the load-displacement response of shear critical RC members and subassemblies under static load reversals are conducted. The analytical results generally show very good agreement with experimental results.

AB - This paper presents the results of analytical investigation of the strength and structural behavior of concrete members prestressed with external tendons. The behavior at both the serviceability and ultimate limit states is evaluated. A nonlinear analysis model, based on the incremental deformation method, is developed to predict the entire response of concrete members originally designed with or strengthened by external prestressing. The proposed analysis reproduced experimental results of deflection and tendon stress responses with remarkable accuracy. A parametric study was undertaken to evaluate the behavior of concrete beams either designed using external prestressing or strengthened by it. The analytical results demonstrated that the second-order effect, associated with the progressive change in eccentricity of the tendons with increasing member deformation, is the main factor that distinguishes the behavior of external tendon from an internal unbonded tendon system. Because of this effect, undeviated external tendons mobilized lower nominal flexural resistance and inelastic deflections than did deviated tendons. When used for strengthening concrete flexural members, providing a moderate amount of external prestressing steel leads to significant deflection recovery, some reduction in the live load deflection, and a substantial increase in the yield load and ultimate flexural capacity of the members.

AB - In coastal areas residential houses are often built on piles. The space below the first floor and the ground is sometimes enclosed. The enclosure walls are constructed to break away under severe wave-induced forces so that the forces transmitted through the breakaway walls to the building's foundation are not unduly large. Successful design of a breakaway wall therefore depends critically on knowledge of the ultimate strength of nailed fasteners and wall material and of the behavior of breakaway wall under wave-induced forces. In this research, laboratory tests were performed to determine the ultimate strength of nailed connections. Behavior and failure modes of breakaway walls from water waves were studied analytically and in a series of laboratory wave channel tests.

AB - Diaphragm test results of a full-scale post-frame building are presented. The post-frame building was tested at various stages of construction to determine the contributions of the different components of the building system as metal cladding was added. Subsequently, the effectiveness of different bracing systems (steel bracing, plywood sheathing, and stitching of panel overlap seams) was evaluated for supplemental reinforcement of an end wall that contains an opening equal to 25% or 50% of the area of the end wall. Wind loading was simulated by applying horizontal loads at the eave. Measured eave deflections and applied loads were used to predict stiffness values of interior frames, roof diaphragm, and end walls. Strain gauges were installed on roof purlins in end, middle, and intermediate bays across the building width to determine the interaction between the roof framing system and the metal-cladding membrane. The full-scale tests provided several insights, including (a) in-plane deflection of end walls, (b) continuity between the two roof halves, (c) load sharing between frames, (d) interaction between roof purlins and metal cladding, and (e) contribution of interior purlins in resisting diaphragm forces.

AB - Engineering standards will need to be developed to outline analysis methods to support performance-based codes being developed in the United States. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art engineering methods for structural fire protection applications that could be incorporated into such an engineering standard. The overview addresses the technical basis, applicability, and utility of a representative sample of available calculation methods. These methods apply to a wide variety of structural members comprised of concrete, masonry, steel, and timber. An analytical assessment of fire resistance includes four principal aspects: fire exposure, material effects, thermal response, and structural response. A description of the fire exposure focuses on the heating conditions associated with the exposure. Material effects include material properties as a function of temperature along with physical or chemical effects of the elevated temperature exposure. Analyzing the thermal response results in determining the temperature profile within the exposed structural member. The ability of the structural member to support a load despite the effects of the fire exposure are incorporated in the analysis of structural response.

AB - This paper presents a 3D mathematical model based on the finite-element method to simulate the structural response of steel and steel/concrete composite connections so that their moment-rotation-temperature characteristics can be predicted. The treatment of material nonlinearity at elevated temperatures is described. A special element has been developed to model the bolts, which may expand freely without creating unrealistic forces on the connected components. The composite concrete slab is modeled by 3D brick elements with a simple crack-crush capability. The numerical model was compared with the results from eight different series of connection fire tests, all incorporating tests with different loading levels. The type of connections included those that are normally assumed to be “pinned” and those that could be classified as “rigid.” The range of parameters included the end-plate thickness and the number and size of bolts. This theoretical model is shown to be capable of providing accurate moment-rotation characteristics of connections that can be incorporated in the analysis of global frame behavior in the event of fire. It can also enrich the database of connection behavior at elevated temperatures.
