AB - A wide range of experimental data and associated analytical results are used to examine the applicability of two widely used design codes (i.e., ACI and AISC) for calculating the capacity of concrete-filled steel tubular columns (CFTs). The database consists of the measured results from past studies as well as from three specimens tested by the writers. The test specimens include short and slender CFTs made with normal- and high-strength steel tubes filled with normal- and high-strength concrete. To gauge the success of the code-based methods, the capacities are also computed based on fiber analysis techniques, along with a member level iteration algorithm for analyzing members with significant length. In addition to inherent differences between ACI and AISC, the reported study points to potentially large differences between the capacities as computed from these two methods. However, the capacities from ACI and detailed analytical results are generally closer. Neither design method appears to be appropriate for CFTs made with high-strength steel tubes. A simple method based on full plasticity of the steel tube tends to produce significantly improved results for such cases.

AB - Seated-beam connections are occasionally used to attach a beam member to a column web or flange, particularly during construction. This paper presents the results of an experimental program that was designed to examine the flexural behavior of bolted, unstiffened seated angle connections. The sensitivity of several critical variables that influence the strength of the connection angle is reviewed. General descriptions of the test procedures and observations are presented, followed by a detailed discussion of the test variables. The test results are compared with corresponding theoretical predictions to asses the accuracy of various analytical models. It was found that seat angle strength is significantly influenced by beam setback, angle thickness, and the bolts that connect the angle to the flange of the supporting beam. Moreover, the strength of the seat angle can be accurately predicted using a plastic hinge based analytical model that reflects the failure mode.

AB - The propagation of long cracks under constant-amplitude cyclic loading is studied in complex welded box beams made of high-strength low-alloy steel. The 8 × 1 × 0.7 m box beams were designed to simulate the cellular structure of a double-hull ship but the results of the experiments are equally applicable to other box systems such as bridges. These experiments were designed to evaluate the residual fatigue life after a significant fatigue crack has formed. After testing, residual stresses were measured on two box beams using the standardized strain-gauge hole-drilling method. The experiment results demonstrated the good crack tolerance of cellular structures. The residual life of a box beam (after a welded detail has failed) was significant. The crack-driving force was evaluated using finite-element modeling. Reasonable correlation between these large-scale tests and the fatigue crack growth rate from small compact specimens was obtained only with models that included the effects of crack closure due to residual stresses. Linear-elastic fracture mechanics proved to be sufficient to predict the behavior of long cracks in this case.

AB - A typical large-scale, steel, multiplanar tubular XT-joint specimen was tested, with its in-plane and out-of-plane braces subjected to a total of 11 different load cases comprising the basic axial loading as well as axial loadings combined with in-plane-bending (IPB) and out-of-plane-bending (OPB) moments. The stress concentration factors (SCFs), strain concentration factors (SNCFs), and the SCF-to-SNCF ratio (S/N Ratio) at the potential hot spot stress locations were investigated. An average S/N Ratio of 1.16 was derived from all the test load cases. The SCFs at typical hot spot locations were also calculated using finite-element (FE) analysis. The good agreement between the numerical and the experimental SCF results confirmed the reliability of the numerical modeling of the XT-joint. In addition, the writers' SCF results were compared with Efthymiou's influence function (IF) method and the ones derived from the corresponding uniplanar T-/X-joints. A clearer understanding of the significance of the multiplanar effects for fatigue design was obtained through this comparison study.

AB - Light gauge metal sheeting is commonly used in the building and bridge industry for concrete formwork. The metal forms, if properly attached to the beam or girder, often behave like a shear diaphragm and restrain the lateral displacement of the top flange, therefore improving the lateral-torsional buckling capacity prior to placement and hardening of the concrete. This paper presents the results of a computational study on the stiffness requirements for shear diaphragms used for beam bracing. Doubly and singly symmetric cross sections were studied. The parameters that were investigated included diaphragm stiffness, load type, load position, cross-sectional shape, and web slenderness. The type of loading has a significant effect on the bracing behavior of the shear diaphragm. Current solutions in the literature are based upon uniform moment solutions and often overestimate the capacity of diaphragm-braced beams. Solutions are presented that can be used to determine diaphragm stiffness requirements to prevent lateral-torsional buckling for general load applications.

AB - This paper presents tests on thin-walled I-sections in combined compression and minor-axis bending. The tests were conducted in a rig consisting of two interlinked actuators applying axial force and end moment. Tests were performed using sequential application of axial force and moment, as well as proportional loading with a moment gradient. The results are compared with the results of proportionally loaded members described in a companion paper. It is shown that sequential loading produces beam-column strengths that are greater than or equal to those obtained using proportional loading. It is also shown that the beam-column strength of members loaded with a moment gradient exceeds that of beam-columns in uniform bending. The latter result is attributed to the effect of greater amplitude modulation of the local buckling deformations in beam-columns with moment gradient.

AB - This paper presents tests on thin-walled I-sections in combined compression and minor axis bending. The tests were conducted in a rig consisting of two interlinked actuators applying axial force and end moment. The tests involved pure compression, combined compression and bending, and pure bending. The test results are compared with the design strengths of the Australian Standard for Steel Structures AS4100, the AISC-LRFD Specification, and Eurocode 3, Part 1.1. It is shown that the experimental interaction curve is close to being linear in the intermediate and long slenderness ranges. The design interaction curves of AS4100, the AISC-LRFD Specification, and Eurocode 3 are shown to be conservative in all cases, particularly in the high moment regions. The conservatism is attributed to the definition of the design bending section capacity in the three specifications. Proposals that increase the bending section capacity are presented based on the behavior observed during the tests. The resulting moment–axial force interaction curves are conservative and in reasonable agreement with the tests.

AB - This paper is concerned with the lateral buckling capacities of cold-formed lipped Z-beams (CFZs). It is argued that design code formulations that are based on those for hot-rolled I-beams may be inappropriate for CFZs, because of the very different cross-sectional shapes and methods of manufacture, and that there is a need for test data on the lateral buckling capacities of CFZs. Described are a series of six lateral buckling tests on simply supported, unbraced CFZs, and a series of subsidiary tests, including tension tests, a torsion test, and measurements of initial crookedness and twist. The test beams failed catastrophically by local or distortional buckling of the most compressed element of the cross section. The moments at failure were lower when the beam lateral deflections increased the compression in the compression flange lip, and higher when they increased the compression in the flange-web junction. The lateral buckling test results are compared with theoretical predictions and with capacities calculated using existing design codes AS4100 and AS/NZS4600. Agreement between the test results and theoretical predictions is reasonably good. The single design curve of AS/NZS4600 may be unduly optimistic for near-uniform bending and unnecessarily conservative for high-moment gradients in beams of intermediate slenderness. Improvements of the design method of AS4100 are suggested for future design code formulations.

AB - This paper reports the results of ten biaxial bending tests on unbraced, simply supported, cold-formed steel Z-beams loaded at midspan in planes inclined to the major principal plane. These results and those of six beams loaded in the major principal plane are compared with analytical predictions and with simple design approximations. The tests show that the beam strengths decrease as the load inclination to the major principal plane increases, and that the strength is higher when the load inclination is toward the web than when it is toward the flange lip. Good agreement is demonstrated between the test results and analytical predictions of the strengths. An extended series of analytical predictions is used to develop simple interaction equations that can be used in the design of eccentrically loaded cold-formed Z-beams.

AB - Many design codes do not give methods for designing steel arches against in-plane failure. The few that do provide methods that are essentially based on a linear interaction equation for the in-plane strengths of an equivalent beam-column, which uses the maximum elastic bending moment and axial compression in the arch. However, the linear interaction equation for a beam-column may not be suitable for an arch because it does not consider the strength characteristics of steel arches. This paper studies the in-plane buckling of arches in uniform compression and uses a nonlinear inelastic finite-element model to develop a method for designing steel arches against uniform compression, and also to develop an interaction equation for the design of steel arches against nonuniform in-plane compression and bending. Analytical solutions for the buckling loads of shallow arches in uniform compression are obtained. It is found that the design equation for steel columns cannot be used directly for steel arches in uniform compression, nor can the design interaction equations for steel beam-columns be used directly for steel arches under nonuniform compression and bending. The proposed design equations provide close predictions for the in-plane buckling strengths of both shallow and nonshallow steel arches in uniform compression. The modified interaction equation proposed provides good lower bounds for the in-plane strengths of both shallow and nonshallow steel arches in bending and compression because it considers the nonuniform distributions of the bending moment and axial compression around the arch, the behavior of shallow arches, and the favorable moment redistribution after the first hinge forms.

AB - The design of H-frame transmission poles subjected to static and dynamic loads (earthquake load) is formulated as an optimization problem. Time history analysis, discrete design variables, and optimization algorithms are integrated to solve the problem. With time history analysis, structural nonlinearity can be incorporated in the formulation; however, stress constraints based on ASCE design force the final design to remain elastic. Two cost functions are defined: Material cost and total initial cost. A method to treat time-dependent constraints is selected for use with two discrete variable optimization methods: Simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. A simple penalty function is defined to account for constraints in the algorithms. Several solution cases are defined and solved. Results show the genetic algorithm to be superior to simulated annealing. Both algorithms are quite simple and appropriate to solve discrete variable problems. Computational times with the methods are quite large because many alternate designs must be generated and analyzed. The use of parallel processors and reanalysis methods is important for practical applications of the methodology.

AB - A method is developed to reanalyze frame structures without requiring reformulation of the global stiffness matrix. The method is particularly well suited to those situations where a limited number of members are changed at each step in an iterative optimization or reliability process. It is equally applicable to those incremental loading process analyses where plastic hinges develop in the members. The method involves the imposition of pseudodistortions that have the same effect on displacements and member forces at all joints as the actual structural modification. The approach is an extension of the virtual distortion method that had previously been developed for pin-jointed structures. A single elastic analysis and determination of appropriate pseudodistortions is sufficient to derive the behavior of the modified structure, thus representing a significant efficiency in computational effort. The pseudodistortion method is applied to sample frames to illustrate its application for member replacement and plastic hinge formulation. A companion paper extends the method to include geometric nonlinearity.

AB - In this paper, the previously described pseudodistortion method is extended for the case of geometric nonlinearity. The general theory of stability is followed to account for axial force-bending interaction and P − Δ effects. The resulting second-order plastic hinge analysis may be solved by the imposition of pseudodistortions on members, and the complete behavior of the structure may be modeled by a single elastic analysis of the original frame and the determination of the appropriate pseudodistortions. The advanced theory of the pseudodistortion method is derived and then applied to sample frames. Results are compared to a conventional nonlinear analysis involving reformulation of the global stiffness matrix.

The special features of this paper, which have not been discussed in detail by other researchers, include the proposition of a torsional strain-displacement relationship for rectangular hollow sections, and the elucidation of the proper force recovery procedure for a displacement-based plastic-zone beam element. Issues concerning the miter model and the use of a consistent tangent operator in geometrically and materially nonlinear analysis are briefly discussed. Verification against three experimental tests on planar and spatial steel frames is included in the paper. It is demonstrated that in general only three cubic elements are required to model a story column with excellent accuracy, and four or five elements are sufficient for a base column with a rigid support. Such meshes are far coarser and thus considerably more efficient than those used by previous researchers for plastic-zone analysis.

AB - This paper presents a new method for the analysis of frames taking into account the distributed plasticity of material. The flexibility method is adopted in the formulation. Under the holonomic assumption for the force-deformation relationship and by using mathematical programming techniques, a one-step loading, noniterative method is proposed for the elastoplastic frame analysis. The proposed method is highly accurate and efficient. A numerical example was used to verify the method.

AB - As part of a larger experimental program on assessment and rehabilitation of damaged, internally ring-stiffened, steel tubular joints of offshore platforms, experimental investigation was carried out on undamaged, internally ring-stiffened tubular joints to study their behavior, determine their strength, and establish a benchmark. The paper presents, in detail, the experimental investigation carried out on tubular joints that are stiffened internally with three annular rings under axial brace compression loadings. The chord and brace diameters of the tested T and Y joints were 324 and 219 mm and their thicknesses were 12 and 8 mm, respectively. The tested joints are approximately a quarter of the size of the largest joints in the platforms built in a shallow water depth of 80 m in the Bombay High field in the Arabian Sea. Bending of the chord as a whole was observed to be the predominant mode of deformation of the internally ring-stiffened joints, in contrast to the ovaling and punching shear of the unstiffened joints. Strength of the internally ring-stiffened joints was found to be almost twice that of the unstiffened joints of the same dimensions.
