AB - An advanced and unique finite-element-based aerodynamic model that can be used to analyze both flutter instability and buffeting response in the time domain is presented. The equation of motion in the time domain is expressed in modal-coordinate state-space form. The frequency-dependent flutter derivatives are transferred into the time-dependent rational function, through which the coupling effects of three-dimensional aerodynamic motions under gusty wind can be accurately considered. The buffeting forces are considered through the quasi-steady formulation together with the appropriate aerodynamic admittances. A multidimensional autoregressive moving average model is used to simulate the fluctuating wind velocities along the bridge. The numerical examples are performed on the three-dimensional finite-element model of the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge with a main span length of 1,990 m. The results show that good agreement in the buffeting response is obtained between the analytical results and the experimental results of the full-bridge aeroelastic model in the wind-tunnel test. Various significant parameters affecting buffeting response are also extensively investigated.

AB - The influence of aerodynamic appendages on the wind stability of box-girder suspension bridges is examined, with special reference to the stability of bridges with very long spans (above 2,000 m). Aerodynamic appendages are winglets eccentrically positioned and running parallel to the bridge axis; winglets can be either fixed to the deck (stationary) or actively controlled. Flutter and torsional divergence analysis are performed using both a 2DOF model and a state-of-the-art multimode coupling procedure. Examples apply to a set of preliminary, defined, hypothetical box-girder suspension bridges with spans of 2,000–5,000 m. Concerning stationary aerodynamic appendages, it is seen that the most promising solution is to locate a winglet only in the leeward position, a possibility originally proposed by the writers. It is also confirmed that the use of active aerodynamic appendages can be a very effective tool in the future to solve the wind stability problems of very long span bridges.

AB - Recently, Ankireddi and Yang derived analytical expressions for the damper characteristics and the controller feedback gain coefficients for the design of an active tuned mass damper system (ATMD) in reducing the first-mode response of buildings under wind loads. These expressions allow one to determine the optimal feedback gains that define the control force. The derivation is based on the simplifying assumption of white-noise excitation to represent the wind loads. This paper examines the accuracy of their expressions when applied to more sophisticated mathematical models for wind loadings. The Hrms norm control technique, in conjunction with the GRG algorithm, is used to obtain the optimal values of these damper characteristics and the controller feedback gain coefficients under both along-wind and across-wind excitations. The results furnished by Ankireddi and Yang expressions are then compared with the present results. For general application, the study covers a wide range of rectangular section buildings by considering representative buildings of very short to very tall ones. It was found that the expressions were reasonably accurate in the case of along-wind excitation. However, the expression for the damper frequency ratio has to be significantly modified for the case of across wind excitation. The final expressions given herein should be useful in giving the optimal feedback gains for the control force to be used in the design of ATMD system for vibration control of structures under along- and across-wind excitations.

AB - A nondestructive methodology is presented for detecting structural damage in structural systems. The procedure is based on using experimentally measured modes and frequencies in conjunction with vibratory residual forces and a weighted sensitivity analysis to estimate the extent of mass and/or stiffness variations in a structural system. Determination of the residual forces and weighted sensitivity analysis involves the use of an analytical model that is correlated to the experimental baseline data from a reference state. This reference state defines the undamaged structural configuration. The method is demonstrated by using a ten-bay space truss as an experimental test bed for various damage scenarios. The experimental results show that the method can accurately predict the location and severity of stiffness change as well as any change in mass for different damage scenarios. The use of an analytical model that is correlated to the baseline test data is shown to improve the prediction; however, reasonable results are also obtained using an uncorrelated analytical model.

AB - Ritz vectors represent an alternative to mode shape vectors as suitable basis vectors for n-dimensional space. In numerical analysis, Ritz vectors have been shown to offer superior performance in model reduction and time-simulations. In this paper, we develop a methodology that is able to extract Ritz vectors from single and multiple shaker dynamic tests. It is shown that the identified “experimental” Ritz vectors are identical to the analytically derived Ritz vectors when the dynamic test shaker locations and directions are used as the reference force locations in the analytical derivation. The sensitivity of the extraction algorithm to measurement noise is shown to be comparable to the sensitivity of modal parameters extracted from the same data set. Finally, to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the extraction algorithm, dynamic response data and static test results from the Space Shuttle vertical stabilizer assembly experimental database are utilized. Compared to static test data, accurate Ritz vectors were extracted using data from both accelerometer and laser-scanning vibrometer-based modal survey tests.

AB - Annoying vibration for occupant-induced footfalls is a serviceability limit state that must be considered in the design of structures, including residential wood floors. Recently proposed design methods addressing excessive floor vibrations require knowledge of the dynamic characteristics of the floor system, such as the fundamental frequency or the root-mean-square acceleration (arms). A finite-element approach was utilized to model wood floor systems under dynamic loads resulting from normal human activities, and design curves relating arms to floor fundamental frequency and mass are proposed. Predicted behavior from the design curves was compared with behavior observed from an experimental study and the two sets of results were found to be in close agreement. From the results, it is concluded that current vibration criteria based upon static properties or fundamental frequency are inadequate for preventing undesirable floor vibration. To obtain an acceptable value of arms for a floor, it is shown that a stiffer floor with a higher fundamental frequency is required. It is also concluded that a proper floor design may be achieved through the use of the proposed design curves.

AB - In an effort to prioritize the repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of existing bridges, bridge management programs have been developed. In recent years, reliability-based optimum-maintenance planning strategies applicable to bridges have been proposed. Optimum inspection and repair times can be identified using these strategies. In this study, the effect of repair on time-variant failure probability is illustrated for several repair/replacement strategies. Time-variant reliability computations are performed using a combined technique of adaptive importance sampling and numerical integration. Several repair strategies are investigated for a typical bridge in Colorado. For this bridge, it is shown that for a single repair performed about halfway through the design life, the postrepair strength must be at least 80% of the original strength for the repair to have a significant influence on the system failure proability of the bridge during its remaining service life. Also, for maintenance using shotcrete, multiple repairs appear to have little influence on the lifetime system failure probability. Also presented are optimal maintenance strategies in which optimal inspection/repair times are identified based on minimum expected cost within prescribed reliability constraints. It is shown that the optimum repair time is dependent on the failure cost of the bridge and that the discount rate influences the optimum repair time and life-cycle cost. As the discount rate increases, the optimum repair time increases until it reaches an upper bound that is dependent on the system failure probability constraint. The results can be applied to the prediction of optimal lifetime maintenance planning strategies for concrete bridges under corrosion.

AB - This paper discusses fire-safe design methods incorporating the application of new fire-protection materials, taking an office building as an example. New fire-protection materials targeted in the research are an intumescent coating that foams when heated and a fire protection ceiling provided with plaster boards to isolate heating coming from the room inside, allowing elimination of the need for fire protection on the steel frames above the ceiling. The temperatures of steel frames subjected to heating by fire were then calculated. Steel materials studied for comparison in the research on the fire resistance of steel frames were fire-resistant steel, for which the high-temperature strength of the steel itself is raised; structural stainless steel, which has excellent heat resistance; and conventional steel. The steel-frame failure temperatures were then calculated. Through these studies, it has become possible to propose an effective approach to fire-safe design, which assesses fire safety of steel-frame buildings in a rational manner and at the same time incorporates application methods for new fire-protection materials.

AB - Results are presented from a study on fatigue damage accumulation in fiber-reinforced plastic coupons and joints. The main objective of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of the Palmgren-Miner linear damage accumulation model in predicting the fatigue lives of FRP structures under stochastic loading histories. The coupon specimens used in the study are configured four ways: with the laminate laid up in two loading directions (0/90° and ±45°), and with the load transferred by two types of bearing (passive and active). The joint specimens considered represent bonded, bolted, and bonded-bolted butt-strap configurations. The results of the constant-amplitude fatigue tests are fitted to two types of S-N curve models: power-law and exponential. Variable-amplitude fatigue tests using narrow-band stochastic stress histories with various root-mean-square stresses are carried out. Rayleigh approximation formulas corresponding to both types of S-N curves are used to predict the fatigue lives based on the S-N curve and loading parameters. The analytical fatigue life predictions are compared with the experimental results. It is shown that the analytical predictions may overestimate or underestimate the actual fatigue lives, depending on the specimen configuration and the root-mean-square stress level.

AB - This paper presents an evolutionary method for structural topology optimization subject to frequency constraints. The evolutionary structural optimization (ESO) method is based on the idea that by gradually removing inefficient material, the residual shape of structure evolves toward an optimum. The method is further developed by allowing the material to be added as well as removed, and this new approach is called the bidirectional ESO method (BESO). BESO has been successfully used for problems of stress and stiffness/displacement constraints. Its application to frequency optimization is addressed in this paper. Three kinds of optimization objectives, namely, maximizing a single frequency, maximizing multiple frequencies, and designing structures with prescribed frequencies are considered. Four examples are tested by BESO and ESO. The objective functions yielded by the two methods are close, and BESO is computationally more efficient in most cases.

AB - A natural velocity field method for shape optimization of reinforced concrete (RC) flexural members has been demonstrated. The possibility of shape optimization by modifying the shape of an initially rectangular section, in addition to variation of breadth and depth along the length, has been explored. Necessary shape changes have been computed using the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) technique. Genetic algorithm (Goldberg and Samtani 1986) has been used to optimize the diameter and number of main reinforcement bars. A limit-state design approach has been adopted for the nonprismatic RC sections. Such relevant issues as formulation of optimization problem, finite-element modeling, and solution procedure have been described. Three design examples—a simply supported beam, a cantilever beam, and a two-span continuous beam, all under uniformly distributed loads—have been optimized. The results show a significant savings (40–56%) in material and cost and also result in aesthetically pleasing structures. This procedure will lead to considerable cost saving, particularly in cases of mass-produced precast members and a heavy cast-in-place member such as a bridge girder.

AB - The assessment of reinforced concrete wall panels subject to blast loading may be based upon the formulation of a dynamic, ultimate flexural resistance-deflection function for the element. With the exception of situations in which the explosion occurs at very close proximity to the panel, the ultimate blast resistance is normally based upon the static resistance, which is subsequently modified for dynamic effects. A previous paper by the writers has shown that the static resistance of panels with door and window openings may be determined by the application of a modification factor to the resistance of a similar panel with no openings. In this technical note the method is validated against the results of blast trials using model reinforced concrete wall panels with openings subject to impulsive loading. It is shown that the impulsive blast capacity of wall panels with openings may be determined by applying a factor to the static ultimate resistance.
