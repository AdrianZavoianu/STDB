AB - The moment capacity of a laterally braced cold-formed steel flexural member with edge stiffened flanges (e.g., a channel or zee section) may be affected adversely by local or distortional buckling. New procedures for hand prediction of the buckling stress in the local and distortional mode are presented and verified. Numerical investigations are employed to highlight postbuckling behavior unique to the distortional mode. Compared with the local mode, the distortional mode is shown to have (1) heightened imperfection sensitivity, (2) lower postbuckling capacity, and (3) the ability to control the failure mechanism even in cases when the elastic buckling stress in the local mode is lower than in the distortional mode. Traditional design methods do not explicitly recognize distortional buckling, nor do they account for the observed phenomena in this mode. A new design method that integrates distortional buckling into the unified effective width approach, currently used in most cold-formed steel design specifications, is presented. For each element a local buckling stress and a reduced distortional buckling stress are compared to determine the effective width. Comparison with experimental tests shows that the new approach is more consistent and reliable than existing design methods.

AB - Cold-formed structural members are fabricated from sheet steels that must meet the various material requirements prescribed in applicable national design standards. These requirements ensure that (1) stress concentrations can be redistributed; and (2) members and connections can undergo a minimum amount of displacement without a loss in structural performance. The 1996 Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand (AS/NZS) 4600, and Canadian Standards Association (CSA)-S136 and American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) cold-formed steel design standards allow for the use of thin (t &lt; 0.9 mm in AS/NZS 4600), high-strength (fy = 550 MPa) sheet steels if the yield stress and ultimate strength are reduced to 75% of their minimum specified values. This paper provides a summary of results detailing the behavior of thin G550 and G300 sheet steel, single overlap, screwed connections. The accuracy of the AS/NZS 4600, CSA-S136, and AISI design standards diminishes when they are used to estimate the bearing resistance of screwed connections that are loaded in shear. Hence, it is necessary to reduce the bearing coefficient that is used for screwed connections to limit the unconservative nature of these design standards. A proposed design formulation that can be used to more accurately predict the resistance of screwed connections that fail in the combined bearing/tilting mode is presented.

AB - Commonly used cold-formed steel sections utilized as either wall studs or floor joists contain web holes. The web holes may be factory punched or field cut. Because the Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members does not address the potential impact that a web hole can have on the structural integrity of the cold-formed steel member, research was necessary. Researchers at the University of Missouri-Rolla have explored the behavior of a flexural member that possesses a web hole. The scope of the UMR research includes flexure, shear, web crippling, and combinations thereof. The present paper will summarize the findings and design recommendations pertaining to web crippling resulting from either end-one-flange or interior-one-flange loading. The research determined that the paramount factors influencing the web crippling behavior were the relationship between the hole depth and the depth of the web and the relationship between the distance from the edge of the bearing and the flat depth of the web. Easily applied design relationships have been developed.

AB - The paper evaluates bond stress and shear connector requirements in encased steel structures, which are sometimes known as steel reinforced concrete (SRC). Bond stress is important to the behavior of SRC elements, and shear connectors are required if the bond stress demand exceeds that capacity. Past research on bond stress is summarized and analyzed. An experimental study is described and evaluated. The results show that the size of the encased section and the length of the bond affect the bond capacity. Confining reinforcement has little impact upon the bond stress capacity, but increased confinement increases the post slip resistance. The bond stress is distributed exponentially under service load but more uniformly after initial slip. Cyclic loading results in deterioration of bond stress for loads greater than the slip initiation load. Shear connectors combined with natural bond stress may produce smaller load transfer than bond stress acting alone, and loads should be transferred entirely either by bond or by mechanical methods. Design recommendations for bond stress and shear connectors are developed for serviceability and ultimate load limit states.

AB - Fatigue damage accumulation in steel highway bridges under random loading is studied. The fatigue life of welded joints has been determined both experimentally and from a fracture mechanics analysis. In the experimental part of the investigation, fatigue test series on welded plate test specimens have been carried through. The materials that have been used are either conventional structural steel with a yield stress of fy ∼ 400–410 MPa or high-strength steel with a yield stress of fy ∼ 810–840 MPa. The fatigue tests have been carried out using load histories, which correspond to one week's traffic loading, determined by means of strain gauge measurements on the orthotropic steel deck structure of the Farø Bridges in Denmark. The test series carried through show a significant difference between constant amplitude and variable amplitude fatigue test results. Both the fracture mechanics analysis and the fatigue test results indicate that Miner's rule, which is normally used in the design against fatigue in steel bridges, may give results that are unconservative. The validity of the results obtained from Miner's rule will depend on the distribution of the load history in tension and compression.

AB - The relationship between axial load and end-rotational stiffness is derived. Reliable postelastic performance of concentrically braced frames requires that braces be designed for predictable buckling behavior. For cross-braced frames, restraint provided by the complementary brace (including both translational and rotational stiffness) can have a significant effect on buckling strength; this effect is complicated by the tension in the complementary brace, which increases its stiffness. Differential equations of stability are employed to determine upper and lower bounds of buckling strength, as well as to formulate the relationship between axial load and rotational stiffness. Given current detailing practices, it is desirable to control the plane of buckling so that the ductility of end-gussets is utilized; values of the effective length factor are provided to allow the design of braces for predictable buckling behavior. Out-of-plane buckling of systems with crossed torsionally stiff braces may place severe torsional demands on the end-gussets of the brace in tension; in-plane buckling is a viable alternative if it can be shown that it occurs at a lower load than out-of-plane buckling.

AB - The effective length factor, K, of a column is dependent on the lateral restraint imposed on it. The sway and no-sway alignment chart K-factors are special cases when the lateral restraint is zero and infinite, respectively. Therefore, they are not directly applicable to practical columns. A general formula is derived that is applicable to columns in fully braced, partially braced, and unbraced frames, i.e., to cases in which the lateral restraint can vary from minus infinity to plus infinity. The advantage of using the formula is demonstrated by comparing it with other methods. For example, the AISC LRFD Specification Commentary does not allow K-factors less than the limit imposed by Eq. C-C2-4b to be used when calculated by means of Eq. C-C2-4a. With the proposed formula this restriction is removed, thereby increasing the design range. It also shows that K-factor formulas based on the stiffness concept become increasingly unconservative as the lateral restraint becomes very large.

AB - This paper extends a simple method of analyzing the plastic torsion collapse of compact equal flange I-section beams to monosymmetric and point-symmetric beams. The method can be used manually, is much easier than elastic analysis, and is no more difficult than the plastic collapse analysis of beams in bending. The use of plastic torsion analysis avoids the conservatism of first yield analysis and design because it accounts for the spread of plasticity through the cross section and the redistribution of torque that occurs in redundant members after the first hinge forms. Designs based on plastic analyses of torsion will lead to significant economies over the first yield designs based on elastic analysis. Equations are developed in this paper for the uniform torsion plastic torques and for the plastic bimoments of monosymmetric I-sections, lipped and unlipped channels, and equal flange lipped angles, and of point-symmetric lipped and unlipped Z-sections. A worked example of the plastic torsion collapse and design of a lipped channel is present.

AB - The effect of panel zone yielding on the potential for fracture of welded-bolted steel connections is investigated, with the objective of gaining a better understanding of the inelastic behavior of the panel zone region and of critically assessing current seismic provisions for steel panel zone design. The research objectives are addressed through detailed, three-dimensional, nonlinear, finite-element analyses of connection subassemblies. The characteristics of the analysis configurations used in this research are derived from the geometry of a typical pre-Northridge fully restrained beam-colum steel connection. Important geometric parameters are varied over the practical range of interest in order to evaluate their effect on connection behavior. To assess the influence of the parameters of interest, a number of different stress, strain, and combined stress/strain indices are employed. These quantities are sampled at connection plastic rotations ranging from 0.0025 to 0.03 rad. Results from the finite-element analyses show that, although beam plastic rotation demands are smaller in connections with weak panel zones, the stress conditions at the beam-column interface are more critical at higher connection plastic rotations. Therefore, although the panel zone can effectively contribute to overall connection ductility, a weak panel zone can also lead to a greater potential for brittle and/or ductile fracture at higher connection plastic rotations. The finite-element analyses also suggest that current design provisions may not be appropriate when applied to panel zones in exterior joints.

AB - This paper reports the results of an extensive finite-element study into the static behavior of axially loaded tubular K-joints. The emphasis of the study was on the effects of the geometric parameters and the overlap amount on the behavior of overlap joints. The results of some K-joints with small gaps were also included for comparative purposes. The study reveals new insight into how the behavior of axially loaded overlap K-joints varies across the practical range of geometric parameters. Certain overlap geometries were seen to be 100% efficient, with the joints reaching the brace member squash load capacity. Other failure modes of chord bending, brace local buckling, and in particular, combined chord bending and brace local buckling were evident. Examination of the load-deformation characteristics for the sharp falls in the postpeak load—reflecting sudden joint failures, which have been a suggested cause for concern in the past—has revealed that relatively few overlap geometries exhibit such behavior. The ultimate capacity results, and their significance in the light of available design guidance, are examined in a companion paper.

AB - The ultimate capacity results from an extensive finite-element study of balanced axially loaded K-joints (reported in a companion paper) are reviewed and compared with predictions from available design guidance. Both overlap and small-gap K-joints are included. Overlapping the braces was shown to have a beneficial effect on joint strength for the joints with relatively thick brace walls, where the strength was found to be up to four and a half times that of the corresponding gap joint. The performance of the available onshore and offshore design guidance for predicting joint capacities was poor, particularly for the overlap joints. The interactive effects of varying geometric parameters are not fully accounted for, generally resulting in high levels of conservatism. A new strength equation developed for the overlap joints has been shown to predict the capacities of the numerical joints studied, as well as those from a test database, with a high degree of accuracy.

AB - An automated damage assessment method for buildings equipped with PC-based strong-motion recording systems is proposed. The major components of the method include a postearthquake data analysis package and a multicriterion damage assessment package. The data analysis package performs the examination of recorded data and the execution of a system identification method. The damage assessment package includes a set of user supplied rules on damage indices identifiable from the recorded data and a damage inference method based on fuzzy logic. Four damage states, ranging from no damage to severe damage, and four probabilistic statements, ranging from very likely to unlikely, are combined to make a statement on the damage state. The damage statements obtained from each damage index are then combined and defuzzified to arrive at a single set of damage statement. Three examples are given to illustrate the process by which an assessment statement on the damage state is reached. This proposed method can be used as a supplement to on-site inspection by experienced engineers.

AB - The American Institute of Steel Construction load and resistance factor design (AISC-LRFD) Specification states that second-order effects should be considered in the design of frames; however, most designers are experienced only in first-order analysis. To accomplish the second-order design requirement, the AISC-LRFD Specification provides an approximate method to account for the second-order effect bases on first-order analysis, where moment amplification factors B1 and B2 are introduced to account for the P-δ effect (member instability) and PΔ effect (frame instability), respectively. However, the B1 factor of the AISC-LRFD Specification may vary greatly from the exact solution, especially when the member is under a high axial load. In this paper, a new moment amplification factor B1* is proposed for calculating the P-δ effect in the design of steel beam-columns. Parametric studies were performed to examine the accuracy of the proposed moment amplification factor and to compare it with that from theoretical analysis and from current design specification. It was found that the proposed method is simpler and more accurate than that given in the current design specification.
