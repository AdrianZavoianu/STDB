AB - This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of deformable reinforced concrete box sections under eccentric loads. A total of eight large-scale tests were carried out to provide experimental evidence for the ultimate load-carrying capacity and failure mechanisms in deformable thin-walled box sections. The main parameters investigated in this program were the ratio of transverse bending to in-plane capacity of the walls in the box section, as well as the degree of load eccentricity. The experimental investigation has shown that plastic corner hinge lines will form, and that the length over which these extend at failure will vary with the ratio of transverse bending to in-plane capacities, and the degree of eccentricity. It was found experimentally that the spread of plasticity in a deformable box section increases logarithmically as the ratio of bending to in-plane capacity decreases. Finally, the experiments have shown that the space truss theory for combined bending and torsion, which does not take distortion into account, will lead to unsafe capacities, and therefore a modification to the space truss theory is suggested.

AB - Several bidirectional tests were performed on structural clay tile infilled steel frames to assess the interaction of in-plane and out-of-plane forces and to understand the behavior of damaged infills. Tests consisted of in-plane and out-of-plane uniform lateral load tests, out-of-plane drift tests, sequential tests (in-plane damage followed by out-of-plane loading, and out-of-plane damage followed by in-plane loading), one combined in-plane and out-of-plane test, and a seismic shake table test. Infill panels had sufficient out-of-plane stability under both inertial (uniform) loads and imposed drift loads. This stability was due to arching, or the development of in-plane membrane forces. The interaction of in-plane and out-of-plane forces was not significant, particularly at moderate levels of loading. The primary effect of sequential loading was loss of in-plane stiffness due to elimination of the diagonal cracking limit state. Under combined in-plane and out-of-plane loading, the infill remained remarkably stable, even after much damage to the masonry panel.

AB - Prestressed masonry as a structural material is still underexploited for the simple reason that basic behavior and complete response up to failure is not well understood. Therefore, to evolve a rational basis for design of prestressed masonry flexural members, it is necessary to experimentally investigate its complete behavior. The present paper gives details of a comprehensive test study conducted on different prestressed masonry rectangular beams and slab specimens. The effect of some important variables such as masonry compressive strength, cross-sectional dimensions, prestressing cable's profile, and the bond between the prestressing steel and the surrounding masonry have also been investigated. The test results monitored are deflections, strains in masonry as well as in the prestressing steel, both in the pre- and the postcracking stages up to their failure. Finally, on the basis of the test results, the influence of the chosen variables on the behavior of prestressed masonry flexural elements has been emphasized.

AB - The effectiveness of prefabricated composite jacketing to retrofit existing circular reinforced concrete (RC) bridge columns for enhanced seismic shear strength is described in this paper. The jackets consist of multilayer prefabricated glass fiber reinforced composite shells adhered together. Three half-scale circular columns were tested under cyclic shear in double curvature and constant axial load. One column was tested in the “as built” condition to investigate the shear failure mode of columns designed based on pre-1971 codes. Two other columns were tested after being retrofitted using prefabricated composite jackets. The as built column suffered shear failure at low displacement ductility. The retrofitted columns developed significantly improved hysteretic responses with stable hysteresis loops even at displacement ductility levels as high as 10.0 corresponding to drift ratios exceeding 5.2%. Method for retrofit design using prefabricated composite jacketing is also provided and validated by the test results.

AB - Damage assessment of reinforced concrete (RC) columns retrofitted by advanced composite jackets was experimentally and analytically studied. The writers built two half-scale bridge columns, wrapped them with the composite jackets, and subjected them to cyclic loading to introduce moderate and severe levels of damage to the columns. Vibration tests using a shaker were performed on these columns before and after jacketing and under undamaged and damaged conditions. The neural network technique was effective in estimating change (representative of damage) in the stiffness based on the measured vibration characteristics. The frequencies and mode shapes of the columns determined from the vibration tests and computed on the basis of the estimated stiffness showed excellent agreement. Pertinent to the purpose of the present study is the success of quantification of the extent and location of stiffness degradation due to different levels of damage. Degradation of the shear stiffness as well as the flexural stiffness in the lap splice region, especially in the 1-in. unwrapped gap portion, of the column was a key parameter to represent the damage.

AB - Behavior of high-strength concrete columns with concrete strengths of up to 90 MPa was investigated experimentally. Large-scale columns were tested under different levels of constant axial compression and incrementally increasing lateral deformation reversals. The columns had a circular cross section and circular transverse reinforcement. Different volumetric ratios and grades of steel were used to confine the core concrete. The results indicate that the deformability of high-strength concrete columns can be improved significantly through confinement. Inelastic drift capacity of columns can be improved to levels well beyond those usually expected during strong earthquakes. The improvements can be achieved with volumetric ratios of confinement steel that are typically used for normal-strength concrete columns, provided that higher grades of steel are used. Furthermore, analytical techniques commonly employed for analysis of normal-strength concrete columns can also be used for high-strength concrete columns, if proper material models are incorporated, reflecting stress-strain characteristics of high-strength concrete and reinforcing steel.

AB - A mathematical model is developed to express the stress-strain relationship of high-strength concrete confined by transverse reinforcement. The model is applicable to both normal-strength and high-strength concretes, covering a strength range between 30 and 130 MPa. It incorporates all the relevant parameters of confinement that have been observed to play important roles in column tests. These parameters include the type, volumetric ratio, spacing, yield strength, and arrangement of transverse reinforcement as well as concrete strength and section geometry. Therefore, it can be used for concrete confined by spirals, rectilinear hoops, crossties, welded wire fabric, and combinations of these reinforcements. It has been verified extensively against data obtained from column tests under concentric and eccentric loads, as well as slow and fast strain rates.

AB - Ultimate strength limit state provisions of the LRFD code ACI 318-95 are based largely on code-calibration considerations. Calibration exercises to date have been restricted to normal-strength concretes (NSC). The present paper calculates structural reliabilities of NSC and high-strength concrete (HSC) short columns sized to existing and proposed concrete rectangular stress block design models. Model errors for existing and proposed design models are presented also. It was found that the reliabilities of NSC and HSC short columns designed to ACI 318-95 are relatively consistent, and that the rectangular stress block design model proposed by the writers is the most accurate design model. Compared with all proposed design models, the reliabilities of NSC and HSC short columns designed to the writers' design model are the most consistent, though at a reliability slightly higher than that currently obtained for NSC columns designed to ACI 318-95. A strength reduction factor increase to 0.8 is proposed for the writer's design model so that existing safety indices would be met. The alternative is to use the existing ACI 318 rectangular stress block (which is a poorer predictor model) with the current strength reduction factor of 0.7. Both give consistent safety indices. The results can be subject to a number of interpretations, particularly since they relate to potential change to an existing code and the various implications that this may have. As such, issues relating to code development are discussed.

AB - This study presents alternative shear strength prediction equations for steel-reinforced concrete members without web reinforcements. It uses the techniques of dimensional analysis, interpolation function, and multiple regression analysis. More than 350 data were obtained from existing sources of reinforced concrete beam shear test results covering a wide range of beam properties and test methods. This analysis was done for both normal-strength concrete and high-strength concrete members with compressive strength up to 104 MPa (15,110 psi). The derivation of accurate cracking and ultimate shear strength prediction equations incorporated the original use of an interpolation function that takes into account the difference in behavior between the arch action of short beams and the beam action of long beams. The use of the interpolation function was instrumental in producing accurate cracking and ultimate shear strength equations as evidenced by the excellent correlation between experimental and theoretical values.

AB - A general framework aimed at dealing with the failure analysis of reinforced concrete beam-like structures is presented in this paper. It is based on the yield design theory combined with a “mixed modeling” of this kind of structure, according to which the concrete material is treated as a classical continuum, whereas the longitudinal reinforcements are regarded as elements working predominantly in tension. In addition, shear-reinforced web zones may be incorporated in the analysis through a homogenization procedure. Both lower- and upper-bound methods are then implemented numerically by means of a finite-element formulation, thus producing fairly accurate estimates for the load-carrying capacity of a shear loaded beam, taken as an illustrative application. In particular, it is shown that the shear-span-to-depth ratio, along with the amount of longitudinal reinforcement, play a crucial role in the transition from flexural to shear dominated failure modes of the beam. This conclusion is supported by numerous experimental observations reported in the literature. Numerical predictions even prove to be in good agreement with experimental results provided appropriate reduction factors be assigned to the concrete strength parameters, accounting for its brittleness under tensile loading conditions.

AB - High-strength concretes containing siliceous aggregates are very sensitive to high temperatures, as shown by the marked decrease of their mechanical properties both at high temperatures and after cooling down to room temperature (residual properties). However, because of the greater nonlinearity of concrete due to thermal damage, the structural behavior is generally less affected by high temperatures than the constitutive behavior, as is shown in this study on the residual behavior of three lightly reinforced and three unreinforced deep beams (fc = 72 MPa). Four specimens were tested after a single thermal cycle (T = 250 or 400°C) and two specimens were tested in the virgin state (T = 20°C), in order (1) to measure the complete load-displacement response in three-point bending; (2) to study crack formation; and (3) to assess the roles of the various “complementary” shear resistant mechanisms. The results show that the ultimate capacity decreases markedly in the unreinforced specimens, but not as much as the tensile strength, and that the role of the complementary shear-resistant mechanisms increases in both reinforced and unreinforced beams, in spite of the worsening mechanical properties of concrete.

AB - The role of numerical simulations in the design of the repair of damaged reinforced concrete structures is illustrated in the context of the retrofitting of a damaged RC cooling tower built in 1963. Nonlinear material behavior of concrete and steel as well as the state of damage, including the nonsymmetric spatial distribution of the cracks and the corrosion of the reinforcement at the end of the anticipated lifetime of the structure, are accounted for in the computational model. Two alternatives for the repair of the shell by means of stiffening rings are investigated. If the repair is based on the application of two cast in situ stiffening rings, structural failure of the RC shell is initiated by two failure zones located between the upper stiffening ring and the cornice. In these zones, the shell is severely weakened by the locally dense distribution of existing cracks and the corrosion of the reinforcement. The coefficient of structural safety of the retrofitted shell can be further increased if the existing cornice is strengthened. This coefficient is considerably larger than the one obtained for the uncracked shell.

AB - The influence of damage on the load-carrying capacity of thin-walled steel columns with channel sections is investigated. The axial load-carrying capacity is evaluated for different profiles, and different damage magnitudes are dealt with. The profiles selected for the analysis are commonly used as upright members in rack and shelving systems in industry. The type of damage corresponds primarily to truck impacts. The strategy presented, however, is generally applicable to different types of profiles, and suitable for parameter studies of different types of damage, load cases, and boundary conditions. The main part of the analysis consists of numerical simulations using the finite-element method, but a verifying laboratory test series is also presented. The results of the numerical simulations are in good agreement with the laboratory tests, and show that even very small defects in the thin-walled columns significantly reduce the axial load-carrying capacity.

AB - In this paper, the results of static and cyclic lateral load tests on the wooden frames that constitute an ancient Korean commoner's house are presented. The typical form of beam-column joint used for this type of house is a tenon. Full-scale models of two types of frames are used for testing. The effects of joint type and wooden lattice on the lateral loading capacity and the failure modes of frames are investigated. The tests show a significant nonlinearity and inelasticity in the load-displacement curve. The general failure modes of joints are either shear or bending failure at the mortise branches of a tenon. The nonlinear hysteretic characteristics of the frame are identified and modeled by the so-called modified Double Target model.
