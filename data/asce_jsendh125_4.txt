AB - The Northridge earthquake of 1994 led to numerous weld fractures in beam-to-column connections in welded special moment-resisting frames. To address building performance issues raised by these failures and to support improvements in probability-based load resistance factor design for steel building structures, four welded special moment-resisting frames of different sizes and configurations that suffered connection damage during the earthquake are evaluated using both deterministic and stochastic approaches. The results of this investigation are presented in two companion papers. This paper focuses on deterministic dynamic modeling issues, using a new hysteretic model that incorporates the effects of connection weld fractures on building response and ground motions believed to be representative of the Northridge earthquake. The degraded connection model results in somewhat larger frame deformations, but its impact only becomes significant at spectral accelerations larger than those believed to have occurred. The agreement of predicted and surveyed damage was quite good for two of the frames, but not as good for the other two. Inherent randomness and modeling uncertainties limit the quality of the agreement that is possible from a single deterministic analysis. Thus, in the companion paper, the role of uncertainties in making such comparisons is investigated. Randomizing the strength and ground motion yields a probabilistic description of building performance that places such comparisons of predicted and observed damage in better perspective.

AB - In this paper—the second of two companion papers addressing damage to buildings with welded special moment frames—the role of inherent randomness and modeling uncertainty on building performance is considered in detail using the nonlinear dynamic analysis procedure from the first paper as an assessment tool. An efficient statistical sampling plan is utilized to yield a probabilistic description of building performance. With this approach, the surveyed damage falls within the scatter of damage predicted by probabilistic modeling. Building fragilities, which depict the limit-state probabilities at increasingly severe levels of ground motion, are illustrated for both undamaged and damaged frames. Median-centered estimates of connection hysteretic behavior are essential to building performance assessment, but the uncertainties in the moment-rotation relations and in other structural parameters are relatively unimportant in comparison to uncertainties in ground motion. Probabilities of nonstructural or minor structural damage in frames of the vintage (early 1980s) considered in this study are substantial, but collapse probabilities are small. The limit-state probabilities are of the same order as those calculated in concurrent independent research, indicating that seismic risk research is converging on tools that will be useful for risk-informed decisions regarding design codes and building rehabilitation.

AB - This paper presents an evaluation in terms of constructability, cost, and seismic performance of an alternative structural system for high seismic risk zones made of composite reinforced concrete-steel (RCS) special moment-resisting frames. Interior beam-column joints and the effects of a reinforced concrete slab on composite metal decking are investigated. The major issues discussed are related to seismic design philosophy and constructability of a three-dimensional RCS special moment frame system for low-rise and mid-rise construction. The key conclusion from this work is that the proposed RCS frame system has advantages over steel frame systems in high seismic risk zones in terms of having a cost-effective construction process and possessing certain stable hysteretic performance during inelastic excursions.

AB - To evaluate the cyclic behavior of a type of as-built steel latticed member for the seismic retrofit of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, cyclic testing of three half-scale specimens was conducted. For eccentrically loaded specimens, local buckling in the end panel caused significant degradation in compressive strength; net section fracture of flange angles near rivet holes where lacing bars were connected was also observed. Bifurcation type global buckling was observed for the concentrically loaded specimen, causing a drastic drop in compressive strength. The buckling strength can be reliably predicted when the shearing effect and the appropriate effective length were considered. All three specimens were able to reach and exceed the strength predicted by the Load and Resistance Factor Design interaction formulas by about 6%, but this overstrength was slightly lower than that typically found in wide-flange beam-columns. Based on the test results, a modified axial force-moment interaction relationship was established. The ductility capacity ranged from 2.0 to 2.4.

AB - Control of the seismic response of multistory building frames using optimally placed viscoelastic dampers (VEDs) is investigated. Responses are obtained in frequency domain using spectral analysis for narrow and broad band stationary random ground motions. Optimal locations of passive VEDs are found with the help of a controllability index, which is obtained with the help of the root-mean-square value of the interstory drift. To highlight the effect of modeling and optimal location of VEDs on the response reduction, three different mathematical models of the VEDs and three alternative schemes of placement of VEDs are considered. The response of the 20-story shear-frame model is controlled by the proposed strategy. It is shown that the scheme of the optimal placement of VEDs provides more reduction in response compared with other schemes of placement of VEDs considered in the study. Furthermore, the optimal placement of dampers is sensitive to the nature of excitation force, total quantity of viscoelastic material used, and the modeling of VEDs.

AB - A number of researchers have proposed using vibrational behavior to monitor structures. When significant damage occurs, there are changes in the structural stiffness. This causes changes in the vibrational information. The basic vibrational information normally collected in field monitoring are the natural frequencies and mode shapes. These can be further processed to modal flexibilities. This paper presents a sensitivity study comparing use of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and modal flexibilities for monitoring. The results demonstrate that modal flexibilities are more likely to indicate damage than either natural frequencies or mode shapes.

AB - An approximate method to estimate the maximum lateral deformation demands in multistory buildings responding primarily in the fundamental mode when subjected to earthquake ground motions is presented. This method permits a rapid estimation of the maximum roof displacement and of the maximum interstory drift for a given acceleration time history or for a given displacement response spectrum. A multistory building is modeled as an equivalent continuum structure consisting of a combination of a flexural cantilever beam and a shear cantilever beam. The simplified model is used to investigate the ratio of the spectral displacement to the roof displacement and the ratio of the maximum interstory drift ratio to the roof drift ratio. The effect of the distribution of lateral forces along the height of the building and of the ratio of overall flexural and shear deformations is examined. Lateral deformation demands of a 10-story steel building computed with the simplified method when subjected to various earthquake ground motions are compared with those computed using step-by-step time history analyses. It is shown that the method provides good approximations, which are useful for the preliminary design of new buildings or for a rapid evaluation of existing buildings.

AB - This paper presents a discrete-time wave-propagation method to calculate the seismic response of multistory buildings, founded on layered soil media and subjected to vertically propagating shear waves. Buildings are modeled as an extension of the layered soil media by considering each story as another layer in the wave-propagation path. The seismic response is expressed in terms of wave travel times between the layers and wave reflection and transmission coefficients at layer interfaces. The method accounts for the filtering effects of the concentrated foundation and floor masses. Compared with commonly used vibration formulation, the wave-propagation formulation provides several advantages, including simplicity, improved accuracy, better representation of damping, the ability to incorporate the soil layers under the foundation, and providing better tools for identification and damage detection from seismic records. Examples are presented to show the versatility and the superiority of the method.

AB - The response modification factor plays a key role in the seismic design of new buildings in the United States. To date, the values assigned to this factor are based on engineering judgment and have little sound technical basis. Any improvement in the reliability of modern earthquake-resistant buildings in the United States will require the systematic evaluation of the building response characteristics that most affect the values assigned to the factor. To this end, a draft formulation that represents the response modification factor as the product of factors related to reserve strength, ductility, and redundancy is presented in the paper. Pertinent data from various analytical and experimental studies on reserve strength and ductility are also presented.

AB - This paper demonstrates how the use of appropriately scaled model experiments can effectively be used to evaluate the dynamic performance of a new gate system. The physical scale models studied in this investigation are exact replicas of the innovative hydraulically actuated wickets to be placed at the Olmsted Locks and Dam for controlling water flow and maintaining a navigable pool on the lower Ohio River. Operating shapes of the flow-induced gate motion at critical configurations are compared with the wet characteristic modes of the wicket to determine the potential resonant vibration problem. These wet modes are extracted such that the effects of structural and hydraulic boundary conditions of the flow field are accounted for in the modal experiment. Experimental results indicate that random energy contents of an ambient excitation can readily be used to estimate the physical characteristic modes of a wet structure. The study also shows that operational deflected shapes for potentially alarming excitations can be compared with such wet natural modes to identify resonance problems. This evaluation procedure demonstrates the convenience in using ambient vibration for the detection of self-excitation problems during the service life of the system.

AB - ASCE Standard 7, “Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures,” has contained provisions for load combinations and load factors suitable for load and resistance factor design since its 1982 edition. Research in wind engineering in the intervening years has raised questions regarding the wind load factor 1.3 and load combinations in which the wind load appears in ASCE 7-95. This paper presents revised statistical models of wind load parameters based on more recent research and a Delphi, and reassesses the wind load combinations in ASCE Standard 7 probabilistically. The current approach to specifying wind loads in ASCE 7 does not lead to uniform reliability in inland and hurricane-prone regions of the country. It is recommended that the factor accounting for wind directionality effects should be separated from the load factor and presented in a separate table in the wind load section, that the wind load factor should be increased from 1.3 to approximately 1.5 or 1.6 to achieve reliability consistent with designs governed by gravity load combinations, and that the exposure classification procedure in ASCE Standard 7 should be revised to reduce the current high error rate in assigning exposures.

A gust factor, G, is proposed, defined as (ug/U) − 1, where ug = gust speed, and U = mean daily wind speed. A relationship between G and U has the form G = AUn, and the data are lognormally distributed about the G versus U regression line. Data from six weather stations—two from the West Coast, two from the Midwest, and two from the East Coast—are analyzed and found to fit the proposed model.
