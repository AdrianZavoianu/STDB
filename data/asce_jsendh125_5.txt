AB - This paper studies composite action in concrete filled tubes (CFT) that have dimensions and proportions like those used in U.S. practice. CFT applications in buildings and the importance of bond stress and interface conditions to behavior are noted, past research is summarized, and the combined results are analyzed. An experimental study is described and evaluated. It is shown that shrinkage can be very detrimental to bond stress capacity, and the importance of shrinkage depends upon the characteristics of the concrete, the diameter of the tube, and the surface condition at the inside of the tube. The bond capacity is smaller with large diameter tubes and large d/t ratios. The bond capacity is interrelated with slip at the steel concrete interface. An exponential distribution of bond stress is expected prior to slip, and a more uniform distribution occurs after slip. An equation that estimates the bond stress capacity is developed, and this leads to design recommendations at different performance levels.

AB - In this paper, experimental investigation of cyclic response of steel-tubed high-strength reinforced-concrete (STHSRC) columns is presented. An STHSRC column is an ordinary reinforced-concrete column where most of the transverse reinforcement is in the form of a thin steel tube. The steel tube confines the whole concrete section and provides high shear resistance. Steel-tubed columns are more ductile and have higher lateral resistance than ordinary reinforced-concrete columns and concrete-filled tubed columns, even under high axial compressive loads. In this paper, the seismic behavior of STHSRC columns is presented. Six full-scale columns were experimentally investigated under constant axial loads and cyclic lateral load/displacement. Test results were compared with those of ordinary high-strength reinforced-concrete columns. Based on the findings of this research, STHSRC columns exhibit higher lateral strength and ductility than ordinary reinforced-concrete columns. Unlike that of ordinary reinforced-concrete columns, the ductility of STHSRC columns is not sensitive to the presence of axial compressive loads.

AB - An experimental study was conducted to investigate the behavior of fiber reinforced concrete (FRC)-encased steel joist composite beams under monotonic loading. This new and innovative composite system eliminates the need for shear connectors between the steel joists and surrounding concrete and the need for conventional longitudinal and transverse reinforcement, all of which are quite labor intensive. All connections in the system are steel-to-steel. Therefore, the system can be used with cast-in-place or precast construction. Ten beam specimens were tested, each consisting of open-web steel sections encased in concrete containing discrete steel fibers. In the test program, the important variables studied were the percentage of tensile steel reinforcement ratio, the shear span-to-depth ratio, and the configuration of steel elements. The test results are very encouraging. The two materials (structural steel and FRC) interact to provide better behavior than that of conventional reinforced concrete beams containing steel fibers. This new structural system appears promising.

All connections in the system are steel-to-steel. Therefore, the system can be used with cast-in-place or precast construction. Simplified analytical methods are suggested in this paper to calculate the flexural and shear strength of this new type of composite member for analysis and design purposes. The study indicates that the presence of steel joists as well as steel fibers can adequately inhibit the chances of brittle shear failure, thus forcing the system to have a flexural mode of failure. The proposed composite structural system has great potential for use under monotonic and wind loading.

AB - Local buckling behavior of symmetrically perforated lipped channels is investigated experimentally and analytically. A total of 63 stub column tests have been carried out to investigate the effects of the size, position, and aspect ratio of rectangular holes on the ultimate compressive strength of perforated columns. A formulation is proposed to predict the ultimate load-carrying capacity of such channels. In the proposed approach the web plate with two rectangular holes is idealized as two unstiffened elements and a central column. The effective width of an unstiffened element is estimated by the Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual, published by the American Iron and Steel Institute in 1996. The Perry-Robertson approach is modified to predict the strength of the central column. The proposed formulation is shown to predict the ultimate strength of perforated columns accurately. The size and positions of holes are the most influential factors determining the weakening effect. The aspect ratio of the rectangular holes has only marginal effects for lipped columns.

AB - This paper presents fixed-ended and pin-ended compression tests on cold-formed, in-line galvanized equal angles. Three nominal section sizes were tested ranging from nonslender to slender sections. Detailed measurements of material properties, residual stresses, and geometrical imperfections were conducted. The pin-ended specimens were tested with a minimal eccentricity of L/1,000 applied about the minor axis to cause compression at the tips of the legs. The test data are compared with the Australian and American specifications for cold-formed and hot-rolled steel structures. The section capacities obtained from the stub column tests are found to be between 15 and 40% higher than those calculated according to the specifications. It is concluded that there is no need to include the additional eccentricity specified in the Australian and American cold-formed steel structures standards accounting for the shift of the effective centroid, and that the eccentricity of L/1,000, specified for all section classes, should be applied to slender sections only. These conclusions lead to increases in the design strengths on the order of 25%.

AB - In the design of pin-ended channel columns, it is necessary to account for the shift of the effective centroid caused by local buckling. The current American Iron and Steel Institute's 1996 Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members and the 1996 Australian/New Zealand standard Cold-Formed Steel Structures calculate the shift by use of effective widths. However, the ability of the effective width rules to accurately predict this shift has not been experimentally assessed. In this paper, recent tests on fixed-ended channel columns are used to obtain values of the shift of the effective centroid, including its variation with the applied load. It is concluded that effective width rules of the American and Australian specifications accurately predict the direction and magnitude of the shift of the effective centroid for plain channels but not for lipped channels with slender flanges. The paper proposes simple modifications to the current effective width rules that provide agreement between the measured and predicted shifts of the effective centroid for lipped channels. The modifications are shown to produce more accurate design strengths for lipped channel columns.

AB - This paper is concerned with the lateral buckling capacities of cold-formed lipped channel-section beams (CFCs). It is argued that design code formulations based on those for hot-rolled I-beams may be inappropriate for CFCs, because of the very different cross-sectional shapes and methods of manufacture, and that there is a need for test data on the lateral buckling capacities of CFCs. The paper describes a series of 10 lateral buckling tests on simply supported unbraced CFCs of two different cross sections, and a series of subsidiary tests, including tension tests, a stub-column test, section moment capacity tests, torsion tests, residual stress measurements, and measurements of initial crookedness and twist. The lateral buckling test results showed that the CFCs failed catastrophically by local or distortional buckling of the most compressed element of the cross section after quite large deformations. The failure moments were lower when a beam lateral deflection increased the compression in the compression lip, and higher when they increased the compression in the flange-web junction. The lateral buckling results showed good agreement with theoretical predictions. The lateral buckling results were also compared with design codes AS 4100 for hot-rolled sections and AS/NZS 4600 for cold-formed sections. It was found that the predictions by AS 4100 were generally closer to the test results while the predictions by AS 4600 were too high for beams with thinner wall thickness, but too low for beams with thicker wall thickness. It is suggested that the formulations of AS 4100 be used for the lateral buckling capacity design of CFCs, instead of those of AS 4600.

AB - This paper reports the results of 34 bending and torsion tests on unbraced simply supported cold-formed steel channel beams loaded eccentrically at midspan. These results and those of 10 concentrically loaded beams are compared with analytical predictions and with simple design approximations. The tests show that the beam strengths decrease as the load eccentricity increases and that the strength is higher when the load acts on the centroid side of the shear center than when it acts on the side away from the shear center. Good agreement is demonstrated between the test results and analytical predictions of the strengths. An extended series of analytical predictions is used to develop simple interaction equations that can be used in the design of eccentrically loaded cold-formed channel beams.

AB - Many column bracing details employed in steel construction do not prevent twist, and subsequently, torsional buckling may control the column capacity. This mode of buckling is not adequately considered in design codes and is often overlooked. This paper documents a finite-element investigation of the torsional buckling behavior of columns with lateral bracing located at different points on the cross section. The location of the lateral bracing on the cross section has a significant effect on torsional buckling. Equations are developed for the stiffness and strength requirements of bracing to control torsional buckling. Details for torsional bracing are discussed and presented. A connection detail must be provided between the column and the brace that controls cross-sectional distortion. A design example illustrates the use of the bracing recommendations.

AB - A computer-based analysis and design method is presented for the design of semirigid steel frames. A second-order nonlinear analysis is used, which includes the effects of the flexibility of the connections and the geometric nonlinearity of the members, in conjunction with the LRFD specification of the AISC. The Frye and Morris polynomial model is adopted for modeling the semirigid connections. The design procedure is iterative and interactive in nature, and gives options to the engineer, interacting with the computer, to change member sizes and connection details for economic and practical considerations. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the design procedure for semirigid frames. It is shown that designs with greater economy may be realized with semirigid connections by a variation of connection stiffness that balances the span and end moments in a beam. The examples also demonstrate the more significant effect of connection flexibility on drift in unbraced frames.

AB - In 1994, California's steel building frames withstood the 6.8 magnitude Northridge earthquake without collapse or casualties. Severe damage, however, was sustained by the welded flange-bolted web connections: at the column-weld interface brittle fractures were discovered. Using linear elastic fracture mechanics this unexpected failure mechanism is explored in this work. Post-Northridge connection test results and recent finite-element studies supply the springboard for this investigation of the fracture strength of welded flange-bolted web connections. A method of predicting the brittle fracture strength of these connections is presented and validated. The probability of brittle fracture is also investigated.
