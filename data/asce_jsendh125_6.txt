AB - Seismic evaluation of a two-story, two-bay reinforced concrete frame infilled with masonry was performed by pseudodynamic testing of a half-scale specimen. The second-story infill included window openings. The specimen was subjected to four tests of increasing magnitude based on the Taft ground motion. Explicit numerical integration with a small time step, soft-coupled load system, and an iterative actuator control algorithm limited the displacement errors normally associated with pseudodynamic testing of stiff structures. The final sequence of tests produced diagonal cracking in the upper story, but primarily bed joint shear cracking in the lower story. Relations between the type of observed cracking and story drift-story shear response are explored. Compressive strut mechanisms are defined from the experimental values of moments and axial forces in the frame and infill panel strains. Estimates of story stiffness from several simple strut models were found to bound the experimentally measured values for both the first- and second-story walls prior to significant damage. Friction-based analytical estimates of panel shear strength were found to underestimate the measured strength and to be sensitive to the assumed coefficient of friction. Available methods for estimating shear strength that neglect infill-frame interaction were found to largely underestimate measured shear strength.

AB - Large-scale structural clay tile infilled steel frames were tested under in-plane loading. All infills failed through corner crushing, and the failure load was relatively insensitive to framing characteristics. An analytical procedure was proposed in which the peak strength of the infill for the corner crushing limit state is a function only of fm′ and the thickness of the infill. This simple method predicted the strength better than any other analytical method. A piecewise linear equivalent strut was used to model the stiffness of the infill. The behavior of the structural clay tile infills (cracking, tile failure, and stiffness) was better correlated with actual displacements, than with nondimensional story drift (displacement divided by height). Bending moments and axial forces in the bounding frame were examined, with the infill having little effect on the moments in the columns. The results of several other configurations, including a repaired infill, an eccentric infill, an infill with column gaps, and an infill with a corner opening, were also reported.

AB - A series of laboratory tests were carried out on half-scale sand plast brickwork panels subjected to uniaxial cycle loading. Forty-two square panels were tested under cycle loading until failure for two cases of loading: (1) Normal to the bed joint; and (2) parallel to the bed joint. Failure due to cyclic compressions was usually characterized by a simultaneous failure of brick units and head joints or by splitting in the bed joints depending on whether the panel was loaded normal or parallel to the bed joint, respectively. The characteristics of the stress-strain relationship of the two loading conditions are presented in this paper. Envelope, common point, and stability point stress-strain curves were established based on test data, and an exponential formula was found to provide a reasonable fit to the test data. It was concluded that the peak stress of the stability point curve can be regarded as the maximum permissible stress level that is found to be approximately equal to two-thirds of the failure stress. It was also observed that the permissible stress level depends on the plastic strain level present in the material due to cyclic loading.

AB - It is expected that during strong earthquakes, longitudinal reinforcing steel in reinforced concrete structural elements may undergo large tension and compression strain reversals. Because of insufficient tie spacing, this repeated loading into the inelastic range may lead to buckling of steel reinforcing bars. Even though this problem has been studied by several researchers, most of these studies have been based on monotonic behavior. In this research, steel coupons were machined from steel reinforcing bars conforming to most of the ASTM A 706 specifications. These specimens were tested under axial-strain-controlled monotonic and reversed cyclic axial loading. The tests were performed until the specimens failed, in all cases under compressive loading. To study the effects of the ratio of spacing of lateral supports (Sh) to bar diameter (D) on reinforcement stability, tests were performed for Sh/D ratios of 2.5, 4, 6, and 8. Based on observed buckling behavior in reinforcing bars under cyclic (reversed) loading, a procedure is proposed for predicting onset of buckling. The use of this procedure, along with an analytical model proposed in the literature for the cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel, gave results that were in good agreement with experimental results obtained in this study.

AB - The paper presents the results of a study involving the static and fatigue performance of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with externally bonded carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) sheets. The main parameters in the static test study were the concrete compressive strength, the number of CFRP laminates, and the placement of CFRP reinforcement. The static test program shows that the application of CFRP to reinforced concrete beams results in increased strength and enhanced performance. Accelerated fatigue testing is performed on several specimens receiving various amounts of the CFRP lamination system, including one member that is fatigued for over half the expected fatigue life, then rehabilitated with the CFRP, and fatigued again until failure. Comparisons are made for the standard section and equivalent sections with two and three layers of CFRP involving the improvements in fatigue behavior, stiffness, and capacity. The results from the fatigue study indicate that fatigue life of reinforced concrete beams can be significantly extended through the use of externally bonded CFRP laminates.

AB - Steel plates can be bolted to the sides of reinforced-concrete beams to both strengthen and stiffen them. When these side-plated beams are subject to their intended design actions, compression, bending, and shear stresses are produced in the steel plates and this can lead to instability by local buckling of the plates. This type of buckling problem is known as a contact problem, since the plate is constrained to buckle in only one lateral direction. The paper presents a Rayleigh-Ritz method of the local buckling analysis of rectangular unilaterally restrained plates in compression, bending, and shear. Polynomials are used to define the displacement function, while the restraining medium is modeled as a tensionless foundation. The method is shown to be very efficient computationally, and elastic local buckling coefficients are presented for a variety of restraint cases for various plate aspect ratios, in terms of interaction diagrams. The buckling model is shown to be in good agreement with experimental results from the full-scale testing of two side-plated reinforced-concrete beams, as presented in a companion paper.

AB - A series of experiments on side-plated reinforced-concrete beams is reported. The experiments are used to investigate the local buckling of mild steel plates bolted to the sides of reinforced concrete beams, and to verify the theoretical results obtained in Part I. Thirteen loading regimes have been undertaken on two simply supported beams. Within each loading run, a section of plate at a particular point along the beam was isolated, and the beam loaded until a local buckle was produced. Each new position gives a unique combination of in-plane axial, bending, and shear plate actions. The results are presented in graphical and tabular form, and conclusions are drawn from a comparison of the experimental and theoretical findings. Both beams were eventually tested to failure, and the effect of local buckling on the ultimate strength and ductility of the composite beam was assessed.

AB - A procedure is described by which nonlinear finite-element algorithms can be modified to enable the analysis of repaired or rehabilitated concrete structures, taking into account the chronology of the loading, damage, and repair. The method defines and employs plastic strain offsets in the context of a smeared rotating crack model. The ability to engage and disengage elements at various stages of loading, as well as the ability to carry forward strain measures representing previous loading and damage conditions, are key aspects in the analysis method. Analysis of beams and slabs repaired with fiber-reinforced plastics demonstrates the accuracy of the procedure in accounting for changes in strength, stiffness, ductility, and failure mode as a result of strengthening measures. Flexure-dominated and shear-dominated responses are equally well represented. The analysis of a repaired shear wall, subjected to reversed cyclic loads, illustrates the ability to model severely damaged structures where some portions must be removed and reconstructed. In all cases, the analysis procedure was numerically stable and efficient at all stages of loading.

AB - The results of reduced-scale failure tests of simply supported four-point-bend beams of different sizes, containing lapped bond splices of smooth (undeformed) longitudinal reinforcing bars, are reported. The tests consist of two groups, with splices located either in the midspan region with a uniform bending moment, or in one of the end regions with a uniform shear force. The specimens were made of microconcrete with a maximum aggregate size 4.76 mm. Beams of three different heights (50, 100, and 200 mm) were tested. The beams were geometrically similar in three dimensions, and even the bar diameters and cover thicknesses were scaled in proportion. The reinforcement ratio was 0.31%. The results reveal the existence of a significant size effect, which can be approximately described by the size effect law previously proposed by Baz˘ant. The size effect is found to be stronger for splices without any spiral than for splices confined by a spiral, and stronger for splices in the maximum shear force region of a beam than for splices in the maximum bending moment region. Generalization of the existing formula of Orangun et al. is proposed and recommended for design. Although the formula provides a safer alternative to the existing approach, further testing is needed for better calibration. The size effect on the nominal bond strength implied by the development length provisions of the current and previous American Concrete Institute code is discussed and shown to be inadequate.

AB - The stress transfer mechanism between reinforcing steel and surrounding concrete through bond and the resulting slip plays an important role in the hysteretic behavior of reinforced concrete structures. Earlier models of the stress transfer problem were based on a displacement formulation. Recent models, however, have demonstrated the significant advantages of a flexibility formulation on account of its accuracy and numerical stability under large inelastic strains in the reinforcing steel and bond damage in the surrounding concrete. This paper presents a critical evaluation of existing anchored reinforcing bar models and proposes a new model based on a two-field mixed formulation in which independent interpolation functions are used for the relative slip and the reinforcing steel forces. The advantages of this approach over existing models are assessed by numerical studies of anchored reinforcing bars under monotonic loads. The accuracy of the proposed model is established by correlation of analytical results with experimental data of an anchored reinforcing bar under severe cyclic loading.

AB - A general method that determines the biaxial interaction diagrams for any orientation of the neutral axis of a reinforced concrete (RC) short column of any cross section under axial load and bending about two axes is presented. Closed form expressions for MnX, MnY, and Pn are derived that evaluate the theoretical ultimate strength of RC short columns using (1) Gauss' integral method for equilibrium; (2) a nonlinear stress-strain relationship for the concrete; and (3) a multilinear elastoplastic relationship for the reinforcement. These equations and the proposed method can be reproduced by another user with minimal calculations (as opposed to other methods), allowing the designer to investigate the biaxial bending behavior and failure mode of short RC columns under compression or tension. The proposed method can also be utilized in the study of the effects of creep and confinement of the concrete on the strength and failure mode of RC short columns of any cross section under biaxial bending and axial load. It was found that the effects of creep and confinement in the concrete are significant on the interaction curves, particularly at high compressive loads, whereas strain hardening of the reinforcement affects the response at high tensile loads. Five numerical examples are presented in detail to verify and show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB - A theoretical model is proposed for analyzing the punching resistance of reinforced concrete (RC) flat slabs with shear reinforcement for concentric loading. Kinnunen and Nylander's and Shehata's treatments of slabs without shear reinforcement and Andersson's theoretical model for slabs with shear reinforcement together with the results of tests found in the literature and those made by Gomes constitute the basis of the proposed model. Two failure criteria are proposed. The first one is for the case of a failure surface reaching to the column, which is assumed to occur when a local mechanism is formed and the shear stress in this region reaches the sliding resistance. The second failure criterion is for the failure surface occurring outside the shear reinforcement region. This is assumed to occur when the maximum principal stress at a section 1.35d (an empirical number) outside the shear reinforcement region reaches the splitting strength of the concrete.

AB - The cracking of concrete is one of the main causes of limited life spans of concrete structures. Besides external actions, cracking can be induced by phenomena involving hygromechanical coupling. Such phenomena involve two types of scale effects—one related to local or global diffusion gradients, the other to size effects on cracking in concrete structures. This paper presents results of a research program on the durability of nuclear cooling towers, with minimum reinforcement, constructed with normal and high-strength concrete, when subjected to hygric and thermal gradients. To this end, a combined experimental-numerical approach is applied involving 1:2 scale structural tests and finite-element durability analysis using a probabilistic crack approach. The model is presented and then validated with experimental data. Finally, from 1:1 scale numerical analysis of the cracking due to drying, it is shown that the structural durability performance, in terms of crack opening, is governed by the evaporable water in concrete; it scales both the magnitude and the time of drying, and thus the crack opening and its long-term propagation. At higher moisture content, this durability performance is only slightly influenced by a high strength concrete matrix or by an increased steel reinforcement.
