AB - Current light-frame wood construction design specifications recognize repetitive member effects in wood-joist floor systems. However, it is unclear whether these design stress increases apply equally to both uniform and concentrated load cases. To address this issue, eight floor systems were constructed and tested to determine their load-sharing properties when subjected to a concentrated load. The concentrated load was independently placed on each joist at quarter span and midspan of the floor while monitoring midspan deflections and reactions at one end of each joist. Statistical distributions were then chosen to represent percentages of load remaining at the end reactions of each joist. By comparing and combining experimental data with previous finite-element results, floor joist design equations were developed for a single joist. Factors addressing load distribution were introduced into these equations for calculating maximum moment and deflection. Additional design equations were developed to account for the “pseudo” concentrated load cases stipulated in ASCE standard 7-95, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures. Inherent load sharing in wood-joist floor systems was found to substantially reduce the moment and displacement in the joists directly subjected to a concentrated load.

AB - Forces in heavy timber members are often transferred at connections into steel gusset plates via laterally loaded bolts, which are arranged in rows parallel to member axes. Elastic analysis predicts an unequal sharing of force between bolts, with the first or last bolt within a row transferring the highest fraction of the member force. The capacity of a connection is taken to be inversely proportional to the force carried by the most heavily loaded bolt. Experiments confirm that there is a reduced effective capacity per bolt with any increase in the number that are placed in a row. This so-called “row effect on strength,” however, is often much less stringent than elastic analysis suggests. The discrepancy is because individual bolts within a row exhibit some ductility in their response, prior to global failure of a connection. Global failure of a connection can appear to be either brittle or ductile, depending upon designer-selected parameters such as bolt slenderness, number of bolts, and bolt spacing. It is demonstrated here that, by allowing for a “limited amount” of nonlinear deformation at bolts, accurate predictions can be made of the row effect on the strength of multiple-bolt connections. A hybrid elasto-plastic analysis reliably predicts the capacity for a row of bolts and whether the global failure at a connection will appear to be brittle or ductile.

AB - It has been suggested that duration-of-load (DOL) effects in connections differ substantially from those in wood members and that the factors developed using cumulative damage models based on tests of wood members in bending (i.e., creep rupture) are not appropriate for the design of connections. This paper presents the results from a test program that attempts to quantify rate-of-load and short-term DOL effects for wood fasteners (such as nails and screws) subject to withdrawal or lateral loads. The results from this preliminary study suggest that no obvious rate-of-loading effects exists for nailed connections subject to either lateral or withdrawal loading. This has particular significance, for example, in the design of roof sheathing systems and roof-to-wall connections to resist high-wind uplift loads. Although by no means a complete treatment of the topic of DOL (i.e., time) effects in fasteners, this study serves to highlight differences between connection and wood member time effects and both raises and answers some questions about the validity of adjustment factors for time effects for short-term loadings (i.e., wind and seismic) in wood connection design.

AB - In this first part of a two-part paper, the statistics of wind loads acting on roof structural components in light-frame structures are evaluated for use in a reliability analysis. Particular attention is paid to typical wood-frame residential construction and to an analysis of wind speeds at locations along the coast of the Southeastern United States. The nominal wind loads on the roof sheathing panels and roof-to-wall connections are calculated using available load standards and other design specifications. A statistical description of the wind load acting on the roof system is then determined using the nominal wind loads and information from a selection of coastal North Carolina/South Carolina sites for which significantly long wind-speed records were available. A composite set of statistics for wind load (as a function of code-specified nominal values) is determined based on an analysis of the coastal sites. These statistics are shown to be valid for different roof zones and different exposures. In a companion paper, the reliability of light-frame roof components subject to wind uplift is investigated and results are presented for three baseline coastal residential structures.

AB - The majority of residential construction in the United States is light-frame wood construction. An increasingly large number of homes are being built in coastal areas subject to hurricanes. In response to devastating losses in these areas following hurricanes, and the increased risk to homeowners, insurers, and local, state, and federal government, attention is being focused on improving the performance of residential construction subject to coastal hazards. One of the most significant performance issues identified is that of maintaining the integrity of the roof system during a hurricane. Reliability analysis provides one possible tool for evaluating performance or relative risk (safety) of structural components. In this study, a reliability analysis is conducted for a simple gable-end roof. Specific limit states (modes of failure) considered include loss of sheathing and failure of the roof-to-wall connection. Statistical information on element and subsystem capacity is obtained from previous laboratory tests and analytical studies. Statistics of the wind load acting on individual roof-sheathing components were determined in the first part of this two-part paper. In the present paper, the reliability of light-frame roof components subject to wind uplift is investigated, and results presented, for three baseline coastal residential structures. The results confirm that there are a relatively small number of sheathing panels and roof-to-wall connections that dominate the failure probability.

AB - The paper presents numerical results concerning the so-called laminating effect of laminated beams. Using the finite-element method, it is shown that the assumption often made of a stress redistribution taking place around weak zones is not necessarily true. A fracture mechanics approach to a possible explanation for the laminating effect is also presented. Here a nonlinear fracture mechanics model is used to verify a hand-calculation formula based on linear elastic fracture mechanics. An important outcome is that, for an initially cracked laminated beam, the failure mode tends to be dominated by shear failure in the outermost lamination as the lamination thickness decreases.

AB - A simplified method to analyze pin-ended girders as uniformly loaded members is presented. This method is shown to conservatively estimate the maximum moment, shear, and deflection of the girder without needing any of the beam reactions it supports. If the exact solutions for the maximum moment, shear, and/or deflections are needed, they can be easily found by multiplying the approximate results by a tabulated constant. Results are valid for any type of pin-ended girder, provided they are loaded by uniformly spaced beams or trusses. This method can easily be programmed into a spreadsheet, calculated by hand, or incorporated into an existing software package.

AB - Finite-element models of a variety of joints between glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) pultruded members are described that reproduce experimentally measured linear elastic stiffnesses to within 10%. The models were constructed using shell finite elements. The material properties of the pultrusions were measured using a combination of tests and fits to numerical models. This approach produced elastic constants that proved reliable in the subsequent finite-element modeling of the joints. Standard data provided by the manufacturer gave inaccurate predictions of the joint stiffnesses. Two types of simplified models were also considered: (1) simplified beam models; and (2) a condensed finite-element model. The simplified beam models replace the joint with an elastic connection region and a torsional spring. The condensed finite-element models use a detailed shell element model of the joint to extract the equivalent stiffnesses of the joint that can be used with a standard frame analysis package. When compared with experimental data, the simplified beam models performed poorly. However, the condensed finite-element models performed almost as well as the detailed finite models.

AB - A simple algorithm for multiobjective linear quadratic Gaussian control that can be used for various structural control applications is presented. This algorithm synthesizes Pareto optimal trade-off curves, which are plots of one performance variable constraint versus another. These curves separate the regions of feasible and infeasible constraints and enable the control designer to minimize one regulated output, such as control force, a structural displacement, or an acceleration, while keeping others within specified constraints. Pareto optimal curves are compared with each other to determine preferred locations for actuators and/or sensors. To illustrate the proposed methodology, numerical examples of simple lumped-mass shear-beam building models subjected to stochastic wind and earthquake loads are considered. Control is presumably through one or more active tendons placed on various floors of the structure. The numerical results presented demonstrate the applicability and feasibility for developing optimal multiobjective controllers for civil structures.

AB - As reliability based methods gain increased acceptance, there is greater opportunity to use scarce resources more efficiently while maintaining a prescribed level of reliability of a structure throughout its service life. The goal is to provide management decisions that will balance lifetime system reliability and expected life-cycle cost in an optimal manner. This study proposes a system reliability approach for optimizing the lifetime repair strategy for highway bridges. The approach is demonstrated using an existing Colorado State highway bridge. The bridge is modeled as a series-parallel combination of failure modes, and the reliability of the overall bridge system is computed using time-dependent deterioration models and live load models. Based on an established repair criterion, available repair options, repair costs, and updating, the optimum lifetime repair strategy is developed. The sensitivity of the optimum strategy to changes in various problem parameters including the prescribed service life, system failure criterion, and net discount rate is studied. Finally, the conclusions reveal that the proposed approach demonstrates real potential for practical applications, needs frequent updates through inspection, and requires considerable research effort to develop accurate input data.

AB - Bridges deteriorate with time due to aggressive environments and are subject to ever-increasing traffic loads. This results in reduction of their reliability, which may eventually fall below an acceptable level. A successful proof load reduces the uncertainty associated with resistance of the bridge and so increases its reliability. Also, if a bridge has survived for T years of service, its resistance is higher than any of the prior imposed loads and so is influenced by its load history. Thus, the reliability of service-proven (i.e., older) bridges would increase. However, the influence of deterioration and increases in traffic loads may negate this expected increase. The paper considers the effects of load history (proof loads and prior service loads) on the reliability of aging bridges. The influence of bridge age and the magnitude of proof loads on updated estimates of bridge reliability is examined. It was found that proof load testing may not be cost effective if the costs of bridge failure (unsuccessful test) and the test itself are considered in a preliminary risk-cost-benefit analysis. The influence of prior service loads on the reliability of existing bridges significantly increased annual bridge reliabilities. The reliability-based approach presented in the paper provides an improved decision-making framework for the assessment of aging bridges.

AB - This paper presents an approach for the reliability analysis of the RC columns considering the correlation between the axial load and bending moment or the uncertainty in the load eccentricity. The reliability analysis is based on the efficient first-order reliability method and uses the inverse normal transformation to deal with the modeling error that depends on the load eccentricity. The proposed approach is more efficient than the ones used in the literature for the reliability analysis of the RC columns because it does not require the use of the simulation techniques and the distribution fitting methods. The approach is used to study the sensitivity of the reliability of the short RC columns to the uncertainty in the eccentricities of the dead and live loads. Numerical results suggest that the reliability of the RC columns, in many cases, is sensitive to the correlation between the axial load and bending moment. By ignoring the correlation between the axial load and the bending moment or the uncertainty in the load eccentricity, the design according to the Canadian Standard Association design code may not be reliability consistent.

It is shown that the assumption of bounded wind speeds and the subsequent implementation of the peaks over threshold method for estimating the required parameters from real data lead to contradictions, and that the Gumbel distribution at several sites serves more realistically as a model for the distribution of extreme wind speeds.
