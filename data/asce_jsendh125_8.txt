AB - High-strength bolted connections with protective coatings are used extensively in bridges. The relaxation in high-strength bolts due to creep in the coating can reduce the shear capacity of the connection. In a recent bridge application using high-strength bolted connections with hot-dip galvanized coating, a loss in the bolt clamping force was observed. Tests have been conducted to evaluate the effect of coating thickness on the bolt clamping force. The reduction in the bolt force for coatings up to 0.508 mm (20 mils) has been shown to be as large as four times that for bare steel. A mathematical model is developed to evaluate the relaxation effect in the high-strength bolted connections. The analytical predictions are compared with experimental data, which shows a very good agreement. An approach is presented to predict the bolt-load retention based on the relevant creep data. The model developed in this paper can also be used for other coating systems to predict the loss of the bolt force due to the creep occurring in the bolted connections.

AB - This paper presents an approach toward formulating analytical models to predict the moment-rotation hysteresis behavior of top and seat angle connections. Experimental results obtained from 12 top and seat angle connection specimens are used to obtain the prediction equations for the parameters defining the moment rotation hysteresis loops of a typical top and seat angle connection. These parameters include the initial stiffness, ultimate moment capacity, ultimate rotation, the transition moment, characteristic moment, and rigidity parameter. Regression analysis results and comparisons with test results are presented to demonstrate the acceptability of these prediction equations. The prediction equations obtained for these parameters are used to develop four different moment rotation hysteresis models for the connection: the bilinear, elastoplastic, Ramberg-Osgood, and modified bilinear models. The results of the study show that the top and seat angle connection behaves as a semirigid connection. A wide range of initial stiffnesses and ultimate moment capacities are possible to achieve by altering the connection geometry related variables within a practical range. For certain geometric configurations of the connection, significant transfer of moment from the beam to the column can occur before the connection fails. Also, it is possible to design a connection with flow stiffness and small moment transfer capability, so that it behaves in a manner such that it is close to being classified as a pin connection. The prediction equations developed for the parameters characterizing the four hysteresis models give acceptable results when compared to experimental results. The degree to which the models idealize the actual behavior varies with the elastoplastic model being the least conservative and the modified bilinear model being the best. The Ramberg-Osgood model is the most accurate in just modeling the nonpinching moment-rotation loops.

AB - This paper describes a series of tests on longitudinal fillet welds in high-strength (450 MPa nominal yield stress), cold-formed rectangular hollow section (RHS) members that have a thickness less than 3 mm. The effect of load conditions, end return welds, and RHS orientation on weld strength is investigated. The experimental weld strength is compared with the predicted strength using existing Australian, American, Canadian, and European design standards. The test results are also compared with the proposed design rules for longitudinal fillet welds in RHS members derived from the previous research project on C350 (350 MPa nominal yield stress) RHS members. A reliability analysis method is used for calibration. All load and resistance factor design standards produce adequate reliability indices. A nonlinear finite-element analysis is carried out to simulate the failure mode and load carrying capacity. The finite-element model has given reasonable predictions in load-deflection curves, stress values, failure mode, and local deformed shape. Design rules are recommended for longitudinal fillet welds in thin-walled, high-strength, cold-formed RHS members.

AB - A critical design stage for steel girders occurs during casting of the concrete bridge deck, when the noncomposite steel section must support the wet concrete and the entire construction load. Although a composite box girder has a high torsional stiffness in the completed bridge, during construction the open section is relatively flexible in torsion. A horizontal truss system is usually installed at the top flange level to increase the torsional stiffness and form a quasi-closed section. This paper presents results from a finite-element study on the bending behavior of trapezoidal box girder systems during construction. The results show that large forces can develop in the horizontal truss system due to vertical bending of the box girder. For truss systems with a single diagonal, the forces induced from bending result in large lateral bending stresses in the top flanges of the box. Many current design methods and computer programs do not consider the truss forces and top flange lateral bending stresses induced from bending. Expressions to estimate the bending forces in the lateral truss system as well as the lateral bending stresses in the top flange are developed. A numerical example illustrates the use of the expressions.

AB - Numerous works have been presented over the years on the ultimate shear behavior and postbuckling strength of plate girder web panels. Research by Basler has been adopted in AASHTO, and the work by Porter et al. has been adopted in British Standard. However, a recent nonlinear finite-element study by Lee and Yoo reveals that considerable discrepancies exist concerning the failure mode between the assumed failure mechanisms and the numerical analysis results; although theories by Basler and Porter et al., yield reasonable ultimate shear strengths for all practical designs. In this study, 10 scaled plate girder models were tested to investigate the shear behavior of web panels up to failure. Test results are compared with values obtained from theoretical models and the finite-element study. Based on this study, the following conclusions are made with regard to the behavior of the plate girder web panels: (1) The boundary condition at the flange-web juncture in practical designs is much closer to the fixity; (2) in all existing failure mechanisms, the through-thickness bending stress effects on the ultimate shear strength are neglected, however, it has been found that very high bending stresses develop at failure; and (3) an anchoring system, such as flanges, is not needed for the development of the postbuckling strength.

AB - The bifurcation buckling and the ultimate strength of curved web panels subjected to pure shear are investigated by the finite-element method. To evaluate the ultimate strength of curved web panels subjected to pure shear to the point of failure, both geometric and material nonlinearities are considered. From the nonlinear analysis it is shown that curved web panels are capable of developing considerable postbuckling strength after the bifurcation point. Results of the present study are compared with those calculated using equations that were recently suggested for the prediction of the shear strength of straight girder web panels subjected to pure shear. Comparisons indicate that the straight girder equations can effectively predict the shear strength of curved web panels subjected to pure shear.

AB - This paper outlines the development of a finite element for use in the inelastic second-order analysis of partially (PR) and fully (FR) restrained planar steel frames. The finite element considers spread of plastification within the cross section and along the member length; centroidal shift of the elastic core; a variety of residual stress distributions; and P-Δ effects. Nonlinear spring elements are used in modeling beam-end connections. An arc-length technique (with iteration) is used in the analysis of individual beam-columns, while constant-work simple Euler stepping (no iteration) is used in the nonlinear analysis of frameworks. Full nonlinear load-deformation response of planar beam-columns and frames is computed. Accuracy is demonstrated through comparison with previously published analytical results. It is shown that concentrated plasticity models may lead to an overestimation of connection rotation in PR frameworks. A companion paper discusses the inelastic ultimate load analysis of large steel PR frameworks and evaluation of connection classification systems.

Full nonlinear load-deformation response, including the ultimate load and unloading path is computed. The state of connection stiffness and connection rotation at the frame ultimate load condition is discussed, and the spread of yielding within a large-scale steel frame is described in detail.

Several of the proposed connection classification systems are evaluated within the context of the frames analyzed and designed.

AB - The realistic strength and deflection behavior of industrial and commercial steel portal frame buildings are understood only if the effects of rigidity of end frames and profiled steel claddings are included. The conventional designs ignore these effects and are very much based on idealized two-dimensional (2D) frame behavior. Full-scale tests of a 12 × 12 m steel portal frame building under a range of design load cases indicated that the observed deflections and bending moments in the portal frame were considerably different from those obtained from a 2D analysis of frames ignoring these effects. Three-dimensional (3D) analyses of the same building, including the effects of end frames and cladding, were carried out, and the results agreed well with full-scale test results. Results clearly indicated the need for such an analysis and for testing to study the true behavior of steel portal frame buildings. It is expected that such a 3D analysis will lead to lighter steel frames as the maximum moments and deflections are reduced.

AB - Conical steel vessels, having an upper cylindrical section and supported by a reinforced concrete shaft, are becoming widely used for water containment in elevated tanks. However, the current codes of practice for water structures in North America do not include any rational method for designing such vessels. In this study, a simple and rational design procedure that considers instability, yielding, large deformations, geometric imperfections, and residual stresses is developed for these hydrostatically loaded steel vessels. The procedure is based on a verified finite-element model and employs a multiple-regression analysis to develop formulas that relate the maximum stresses resulting from the hydrostatic pressure to geometric and thickness parameters. The approach uses these formulas to permit the design of variable thickness liquid-filled conical tanks that are subjected to both hydrostatic and snow load. Verification of the design procedure is carried out to prove that the procedure is accurate, economical, and conservative.

AB - To ensure structural integrity after modification and/or retrofitting, the behavior of strengthened tubular joints needs to be understood. The finite-element method is a useful tool for studying the problem. However, this numerical technique has to be verified by experimental results before being used extensively. In this paper, the ultimate capacity of doubler plate–reinforced tubular joints is studied. To establish a reference point, a doubler plate–reinforced tubular T-joint was fabricated, instrumented, and tested to failure under axial compression brace loading. The structural behaviors were observed and analyzed. It was found that the ultimate capacity was greatly improved by the inclusion of the doubler plate. The experimental load-displacement curves were compared with the finite-element predictions and good agreement was obtained. The finite-element techniques were then verified and could be used to study the ultimate capacity. A behavioral study was then conducted by applying various types of brace loading and varying different geometric parameters, one at a time.

AB - The response of aluminum beams subjected to concentrated loading is investigated experimentally through a series of 52 tests. Three different aluminum alloy AA6082-T6 extrusions are included in the test program: one double T section and two square hollow sections with different wall thicknesses (SHS-3 and SHS-5). These profiles were tested as simply supported beams loaded either at the midspan or at the end supports. The results show that web thickness, flange stiffness, beam span, and overhang are important factors that influence the capacity. In addition, the influence of applying the concentrated load through a circular or rectangular bar was investigated for the SHS-5 extrusion, and for all cases where bending was limited, the circular bar loading significantly increased the capacity. The beams were rotated systematically about the longitudinal axis in order to investigate the influence of loading the specimens on their different sides, and the effect was measured in the range of 3.2–11.4% of the mean values for each cross section and loading case. Furthermore, comprehensive measurements of the material properties and the initial geometry, including geometrical imperfections, were important for investigation of the influence of material and geometry variations on the member response.

AB - An experimental program for evaluating the rotational capacity of aluminum beams subjected to a moment gradient loading is presented. The study focuses on local buckling and on the tensile failure susceptibility. Results are compared with design codes. Beams of different tempers, cross sections, and lengths were tested. Some beams were welded, whereas others were unwelded. Uniaxial tensile tests revealed a pronounced plastic anisotropy in the extruded beams. Tests from the reduced strength zone near welds indicate a local ultimate strength on the order of 67% of the parent material yield strength in alloy AA 6082-T6. Nevertheless, the local failure mode is ductile. The strain-hardening behavior of the material and compressive flange width-thickness ratio have a strong influence on both the moment capacity and the rotational capacity of aluminum beams. The magnitude of the moment gradient has a significant influence on rotational capacity, whereas the effect on the moment capacity is not very pronounced in the experiments. Welded members may suffer a tremendous loss of rotational capacity owing to premature tensile failure. Moreover, the tests provide a calibration basis for numerical modeling.

A numerical model of rotational capacity of aluminum beams is established using the nonlinear implicit code given in the ABAQUS/Standard Theory Manual. The performance of the model is compared with experimental results presented in the companion paper in this issue. A sensitivity study is carried out in order to establish the sensitivity of the predicted results to model parameters that are not well defined at different section slenderness levels. The results obtained compare well with the experiments in that discrepancies between the experimental and numerical models have a limited effect on the results. Furthermore, the results show clearly that the finite-element model can be used to predict the load-deflection behavior under local buckling of compact aluminum beams, provided that the plastic anisotropy and the uniaxial stress-strain behavior of the material is well described. The validated model provides a basis for future parametric studies aimed at an improved understanding of the inelastic behavior of aluminum beams and improved cross-sectional classification in structural design codes.

AB - Aluminum alloys are used in a variety of structural engineering applications, such as transportable and lightweight bridges, due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and durability. However, the heat of welding may reduce their strength significantly and necessitate the inclusion of strength reduction factors in design calculations. Theoretical procedures for predicting ultimate shear and patch resistance, which include material strength reduction factors to allow for welding, are now incorporated in BS8118, the code of practice for aluminum structures, and EC9, the Eurocode of practice for aluminum structures. However, when compared with available test results, theoretical predictions in accordance with BS8118 and EC9 appear unduly conservative. Experimental and theoretical studies of the behavior and strength of welded aluminum alloy plate girders, subjected to shear and patch loading, are reviewed and discussed. Theoretical predictions of the ultimate resistance, based on modified and developed theories, are compared and show consistent and improved correlation with experimental results.
