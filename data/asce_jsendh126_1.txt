AB - Ultrasonic indications in the roots of complete penetration welds (W1's) were the most common of the unexpected conditions identified after the 1994 Northridge earthquake in welded steel moment frame (WSMF) buildings. Widely treated by the engineering profession as earthquake-caused damage requiring repair, and characterized as such by the SAC, W1's have not previously been subjected to systematic study either to factually establish their ostensible relationship to earthquake ground motions or to debunk it. In this first part of a two-part paper, the conclusions from several studies that were generally directed toward accurately characterizing W1's, identifying their origins, clarifying the extent and distribution of earthquake damage to WSMF buildings caused by the Northridge event, and developing recommendations for cost-efficient post-earthquake damage surveying of WSMF buildings are presented. In a companion paper, the reliability of ultrasonic testing (UT) of WSMF buildings during construction is also investigated as a possible explanation for the widespread presence of W1's in existing WSMF buildings. The studies found that W1's are not related to earthquake ground motion, that the extent of Northridge earthquake damage to WSMF buildings is substantially less than previously published accounts suggest, and that UT as normally implemented by testing lab personnel is an unreliable inspection technique for the roots of complete penetration T-joints with backing.

Widely treated by the engineering profession as earthquake-caused damage requiring repair, and characterized as such by the SAC, W1's have not previously been subjected to systematic study either to factually establish their ostensible relationship to earthquake ground motions or to debunk it. In this paper, the reliability of ultrasonic testing (UT) of full-penetration welded joints with backing in WSMF buildings is investigated. A study involving verification of the findings of UT via destructive investigation, a study of the influence of operator variability, and studies delineating some of the limitations of ultrasonics are described. In the first part of this two-part paper, several studies that were generally directed toward accurately characterizing W1's, identifying their origins, clarifying the extent and distribution of earthquake damage to WSMF buildings caused by the Northridge event, and developing recommendations for cost-efficient post-earthquake damage surveying of WSMF buildings were presented. Those studies found that W1's are not related to earthquake ground motion, and that the extent of Northridge earthquake damage to WSMF buildings is substantially less than previously published accounts suggest. In the present paper, it is shown that, as normally implemented by testing lab personnel, UT is an unreliable inspection technique for complete penetration T-joints with backing, which provides a plausible explanation for the widespread occurrence of W1's in existing buildings.

AB - Forty tee-joint specimens were tested to assure that through-thickness strength or ductility of the column flanges is not a potential failure mode for welded moment connections. The specimens were designed with 690-MPa yield-strength pull plates and a high-strength high-toughness double groove shop weld (not representative of structural welds) to attempt to induce through-thickness failures in column flanges. Despite high strain rate, high-heat input welds, and several details designed to trigger fractures, only one through-thickness failure occurred. In most cases the pull plates broke, and in all cases the stress levels exceeded 690 MPa, well above the stress level that could be delivered by structural steel beam flanges. The only specimen fabricated without continuity plates resulted in a through-thickness brittle fracture of the column flange, although the nominal pull-plate stress was quite high (698 MPa). The lack of yielding in the through-thickness direction can be explained by the existence of triaxial constraint of the column flange material.

AB - The problems with welded moment connections in the Northridge earthquake of 1994 gave researchers incentive to examine the actual contribution of the simple, or shear, connections to the lateral resistance of welded steel moment-frame buildings. With the composite action of the floor slab, these connections may have more lateral resistance than traditionally assumed; thus, they may be used in the repair or retrofit of damaged welded steel moment-frame buildings or used more actively in new construction. To evaluate these possibilities, and to establish the strength, stiffness, and ductility of these connections under cyclic loading, two series of eight full-scale, cyclic tests on shear connections with floor slabs were planned. The first test series has demonstrated the cyclic behavior of the simple connections and has shown that these “pinned” connections have significant moment capacities, both on their own and with the contribution of the floor slab. This paper summarizes the results of the first eight tests.

AB - Fully restrained steel moment connections have been designed following a codified design procedure. This design was invalidated by brittle connection fractures discovered after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. A new, widely accepted earthquake-resistant design has not been developed to date. This paper presents a summary of the test results on a post-Northridge steel moment connection design proposed by the SAC Joint Venture. The SAC post-Northridge connection design is a conventional unreinforced welded flange/bolted web connection made using notch-tough weld metal and improved welding practices. This connection achieves a mean plastic rotation of 1.5% radian, averaged over a wide range of connection parameters. The results of these tests show that weld fracture mitigation measures are beneficial, but are not sufficient to produce a connection design that satisfies the plastic rotation requirements for steel moment-resisting frames in regions of high seismicity. A new, earthquake-resistant connection design should be based on a combination of weld fracture mitigation measures and changes of connection configuration aimed at reducing the stress levels or redirecting the stress flow in the connection.

AB - The results of tests on 48 T-stub specimens are presented and discussed. These tests were carried out as part of a SAC Phase II project in order to provide insight into the behavior, failure modes, and ductility of these components. The main variables tested include the size of the T-stub, the gauges of the bolts, and the type and diameter of the bolts. The primary intent was to develop a large database to calibrate simplified models suitable for design. In order to develop these models, a comprehensive instrumentation system that could identify the different components of deformation in the individual T-stubs was utilized. Most of the T-stubs failed by net section fracture through the stem and by tension fracture of the bolts, but generally the failure was after significant plastification had occurred. Other failure modes observed included bolt shear and block shear. The results indicate that current design equations provide conservative estimates of the ultimate strength of the T-stubs but that they are not necessarily good predictors of the governing failure modes.

AB - The effectiveness of using the reduced beam section (RBS) and welded haunch for seismic rehabilitation of pre-Northridge steel moment connections was investigated through cyclic testing of six full-scale specimens—three of them incorporated lightweight concrete slabs. Test results showed that, unless the low-toughness E70T-4 groove weld was replaced by notch-tough weld metal, introducing RBS to the beam bottom flange alone could not prevent brittle fracture in the groove weld of the top flange. The presence of a concrete slab or removing steel backing only improved the cyclic performance slightly. Although two RBS specimens with weld replacement performed well, a new type of ductile fracture along the “k” line of the beam was observed. With E70T-4 groove welds in place, however, the welded haunch specimens performed better than the RBS specimens. No brittle fracture occurred when the slab was present. The composite slab only increased the beam positive flexural strength by about 10%.

AB - This paper describes a design procedure for the seismic rehabilitation of pre-Northridge steel moment connections using a welded haunch. Experimental results from cyclic testing of full-scale specimens demonstrated that welding a triangular haunch beneath the beam's bottom flange significantly improved the seismic performance of steel moment connections. The welded haunch drastically changed the beam shear force transfer mechanism, which assisted in reducing the demands at the beam flange groove welds. Analytical studies further showed that the tensile stress in the existing beam flange groove weld can be reduced to a reasonable level if the flange of the haunch is designed to provide sufficient stiffness and strength. However, traditional beam theory cannot provide a reliable prediction of the beam's flexural stress distribution near the column face. A simplified model that allows the designer to predict the stress level in the beam flange groove welds is presented.

AB - The effect of the local geometric details and yield-to-ultimate stress ratio on the inelastic behavior of pre-Northridge connections is studied through 3D nonlinear finite-element analyses of connection subassemblages. Geometric details considered include shape and size of the access hole and presence or absence of the continuity plate and its thickness. Results from the finite-element analyses highlight the detrimental effect of using steel with the high yield-to-ultimate stress ratio and show that enlarging the size of the access hole to facilitate welding increases the potential for ductile fracture at the root of the access hole. It is suggested that currently recommended provisions for continuity plate thickness could be relaxed for one-sided moment connections.

AB - Detailed 2D and 3D finite-element analyses are used to study fracture toughness requirements in welded beam-column connections. Toughness demands are quantified in terms of the elastic stress intensity factor KI and inelastic crack tip opening displacement. The analyses confirm observations from the Northridge earthquake and full-scale connection tests that standard pre-Northridge connections with built-in weld root flaws and low toughness E70T-4 weld metal are likely to fracture without significant yielding. Subsequent analyses are used to examine modifications to the connection details that reduce loading-induced toughness demands on the welds and thereby improve the fracture resistance. Data describe how fracture demands are affected by the weld matching ratio, joint panel shear strength, weld reinforcing, and residual stresses.

AB - A summary is presented of a comprehensive study on the seismic behavior of ductile steel moment resisting frame (SMRF) structures with fully restrained connections. The study focuses on the seismic behavior of code compliant structures of different heights (3-, 9-, and 20-stories), located in regions of different seismicity (Los Angeles, Seattle, and Boston), and subjected to sets of ground motions representative of various hazard levels (return periods of 72, 475, and 2,475 years). Structural behavior characteristics are illustrated by means of inelastic static (pushover) analysis results. Dynamic performance characteristics are evaluated from story drift demand predictions obtained through nonlinear time history analysis. The sensitivity of the response to analytical modeling is appraised. The performance of the model structures is found to be in fair agreement with general expectations for conventional design events and more frequent earthquake events. For rare events larger than expected inelastic deformations may be experienced and the potential for unacceptable performance is not negligible.

AB - Case studies of two buildings having partially restrained (PR) moment frame lateral-force-resisting systems are presented: a 3-story building for a Los Angeles Uniform Building Code (UBC) zone 4 site, and a 9-story building for a Seattle zone 3 site. The buildings are designed using state-of-practice techniques for PR construction. Seismic behavior is evaluated using performance-based engineering objectives via numerous nonlinear time history computer analyses using suites of earthquake ground motions. It is found that the PR buildings have the potential for use in areas of moderate and high seismicity, but there are factors that must be addressed prior to their acceptance.

AB - The seismic behavior of a three-story steel framed building designed by consultants for Los Angeles seismic conditions was assessed using 3D dynamic inelastic time-history analyses with near-fault as well as code design level earthquake records. It is shown that 3D frame drifts due to simultaneous strike-normal and strike-parallel shaking were sometimes greater and other times less than for a 2D frame subjected to strike-normal shaking only. The ability of the 30% rule, Square Root of the Sum of the Squares, and Sum-of-Absolute-Values methods to assess building drifts for bidirectional shaking effects is dependent on the reference axes chosen. In come cases, horizontal shaking orthogonal to the principal shaking direction increased drifts in the principal shaking direction by up to 84%. This occurred as a result of biaxial flexural yielding at column bases so that even the Sum-of-Absolute-Values method underestimated the actual drifts. Also, gravity columns, which were pinned at the base, yielded at the top of the first story due to the severe near fault shaking.

AB - A central portion of an extensive investigation into the effects of beam-column connection fractures on seismic interstory drift demands for steel moment-resisting frame (SMRF) structures is summarized. Nonlinear dynamic analyses are carried out for six SAC Phase II buildings modeled with brittle connections and subjected to the SAC ground motions at two probability levels. Story drift demand statistics for the model structures with brittle connections are compared with those for the model structures with ductile connections. An empirical analysis model for connection fracture is employed, with values for the parameters of the model calibrated by field and laboratory data. The sensitivities of story drift demands to variations in the fracture parameters are explored. In particular, the case when only bottom beam-flange-connections fracture is contrasted with the case of both top- and bottom-flange fractures. Whereas the effects of single-flange (e.g., bottom-flange) fractures alone on story drift demands are perhaps less than anticipated, the additional effects of second-flange (e.g., top-flange) fractures can be substantial. In either case, the effects of connection fractures are more pronounced at higher drift demand levels.

AB - This paper presents an analytical study on static moment redistribution and resultant reduction of lateral resistance caused by sudden beam fractures in steel moment frames. A numerical example is presented for a simple multispan frame, and the step-by-step processes of beam fractures, moment redistribution, and loss in resistance under statically increasing lateral deflection are examined. The mechanism of moment redistribution is interpreted using the three-moment equations, and the possibility of sequential fractures in the course of static moment redistribution is investigated. A sudden fracture of a beam changes moment distribution rather locally, particularly when plastic hinges are already formed in beams by the time of the fracture. Sequential fractures are less likely to occur during static moment redistribution when rotations corresponding to fracture are large (to simulate fractures after significant plastification) and vary from plastic hinge to plastic hinge (to allow for the random nature of fractures). It should be carefully noted that the above observations are applicable for static moment redistribution, and do not necessarily represent the effects of beam fractures on dynamic responses.

AB - Inelastic seismic response of steel moment resisting frame structures, which are usually quite flexible and subject to large displacements under severe ground motions, may be severely influenced by the structure P-delta effect. For structures in which this effect induces a negative postyield story stiffness, as seen from a pushover (story shear-story displacement) curve, the response becomes very sensitive under ground motions that are sufficiently strong to drive the structure into this negative postyield stiffness range. The response under such conditions may be highly nonsymmetric with progressive displacements to one side, which increases the collapse potential of the structure in a sidesway mode. This paper focuses on two case studies that (1) illustrate P-delta sensitive behavior; (2) demonstrate the sensitivity of predicted behavior to ground-motion characteristics and analytical modeling; and (3) contribute to the development of engineering guidelines for protection against excessive P-delta effects. A relatively simple procedure is proposed for identifying P-delta sensitive cases, and recommendations are made for improving the P-delta response of flexible steel frame structures.
