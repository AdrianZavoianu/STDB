AB - The inelastic cyclic response of hybrid connections consisting of RC columns and steel beams (RCS) is studied in this paper. Experimental results from the lateral load testing of nine exterior RCS connections are presented. The primary joint details investigated are two-part U-shaped stirrups passing through holes in the web of the steel beams, steel band plates or cover plates surrounding the joint region, steel fiber concrete or engineered cementitious composite material in the connection, and bearing bars attached to the steel beam. Experimental results indicate that RCS frames are suitable for use in high seismic risk zones. All of the specimens maintained their strength at large levels of story drift without significant loss of stiffness. A joint hoop volumetric ratio of 0.9% was found to be adequate for confinement in RCS joints. However, the amount of joint stirrups can be reduced or even eliminated if steel band plates, engineered cementitious composite material, or fiber reinforced concrete are used in the joint.

AB - To expedite the fabrication of reinforcement cages of columns, a new configuration of transverse reinforcement with alternate ties for columns is proposed. To evaluate the effect of such a configuration on the seismic performance of the column, nine reinforced concrete columns with a cross section of 400 × 400 mm were tested. Except for the transverse reinforcement, all columns were designed according to the seismic provisions of the American Concrete Institute. The tie configuration and axial load were the two main parameters investigated in the experimental program. It was found from the test results that the proposed configuration of transverse reinforcement provides comparable or improved seismic performance in terms of member ductility and energy dissipation capacity to those usually used in design, and the requirement for compression lap splice in the ties is also adequate when the proposed alternate configuration of transverse reinforcement is used.

AB - The connections of welded steel moment frames undergo a complex multiaxial state of stress that leads to high levels of stress triaxiality. As triaxiality increases, the propensity for fracture increases. Classic engineering models of fracture and modern microscale models of fracture mechanisms explicitly consider the role of triaxiality. Nonetheless, triaxiality is generally not directly considered by structural engineers. In this paper, triaxiality is defined as the ratio of the maximum principal stress to the von Mises stress. Triaxiality and maximum principal stress demands are investigated for tests on fractured notched round bars, small-scale tension specimens, and a full-scale moment connection. Based on analysis of the tests, it is proposed that, for fractures driven by triaxiality demands, the maximum principal stress at fracture is a function of the level of triaxiality. Calculation of the triaxiality demands requires 3D nonlinear analysis and depends on the loading, connection geometry, and postyield stress-strain relationships of all parent and weld metals. Examination of a welded steel moment connection indicates particularly high triaxiality demands. The triaxiality demands indicate that fracture of these connections may be governed by triaxiality even when high toughness parent and weld metals are used.

AB - This paper investigates experimentally the dynamic interaction between components of electrical substation equipment interconnected by rigid bus conductors. Specific tests conducted in this study were (1) quasi-static tests of three different types of rigid bus with spring connectors; (2) quasi-static tests of one rigid bus slider; and (3) shake table tests of five different pairs of generic substation equipment specimens interconnected by three different rigid bus assemblies. All connectors tested exhibited stable hysteretic behavior with various degrees of energy dissipation capacity. The spring connectors dissipate energy through yielding and generated the highest forces among the connector tested and generally caused an amplification of the dynamic response of one of the interconnected equipment components. The bus slider dissipated energy through friction and generated lower forces than those of the spring connectors. Its high damping capacity, however, systematically reduced the dynamic response of interconnected equipment components. Finally, a special seismic connector that incorporates three flexural vertical aluminum cables generated the lowest forces. Its minimal damping capacity, however, resulted in higher equipment dynamic response than with the bus slider.

AB - The results of a comprehensive statistical study of inelastic displacement ratios that permit the estimation of maximum lateral inelastic displacement demands on a structure from maximum lateral elastic displacement demands are presented. These ratios were computed for single-degree-of-freedom systems undergoing different levels of inelastic deformation when subjected to a relatively large number of recorded earthquake ground motions. The study is based on 264 acceleration time histories recorded on firm sites during various earthquakes in California. Three types of soil conditions with shear-wave velocities higher than 180 m/s are considered. The influences of period of vibration, level of ductility demand, site conditions, earthquake magnitude, and epicentral distance are carefully evaluated and discussed. Inelastic displacement ratios associated with mean values are presented. Special emphasis is given to the disperson of the results. It is concluded that for sites with average shear-wave velocities higher than 180 m/s the influence of soil conditions is relatively small and can be neglected for design purposes. Finally, results from nonlinear regression analyses are presented that provide a simplified expression to be used in the design to approximate mean inelastic displacements ratios for structures on firm sites.

AB - Widespread occurrence of brittle beam-to-column connection fracture has been discovered in steel frame buildings after 1994 Northridge and 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquakes. To investigate the effects of connection failure on structural response of steel buildings under earthquakes, a smooth connection-fracture hysteresis model based on the Bouc-Wen model is developed. It can reproduce the hysteretic characteristics found in cyclic loading tests of the FEMA/SAC (SEAOC, ATC, CUREe) steel project. To account for the effects of flexible floor systems, biaxial interaction, and torsional motion, a 3D inelastic structural analysis model developed by the writers is used. From a numerical study, it was found that for response evaluation of strong-column, weak-beam type steel buildings a conventional shear-building model assuming rigid floor systems is not adequate. The response behavior of steel buildings with connection fractures may only be moderately altered if there is some residual strength after the fracture. On the other hand, once connection fracture results in complete structural member failures, the response would increase drastically that collapse might occur. The methods of modeling and response analysis developed will be used in the reliability and redundancy study in the companion paper.

AB - The redundancy of building structures under earthquake ground motion attracted more attention after the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquakes. Very little, however, is known on redundancy under stochastic dynamic loads primarily due to the analytical difficulty associated with such problems. This paper proposes a method for evaluation of structural reliability and redundancy of steel buildings under earthquakes in terms of maximum column drift ratio (MCDR). The seismic hazard is expressed in terms of annual exceedance probability of biaxial spectral displacement (BSD). A power law relationship between MCDR and BSD is then established from regression analyses of building response under SAC (SEAOC, ATC, CUREe) ground motions for a wide range of intensity. The annual exceedance probability of MCDR is then determined from the BSD hazard curve for a given MCDR threshold multiplied by a correction factor for the capacity and modeling uncertainties. The effects of brittle connection failure, biaxial interaction, and torsional motion are examined. A uniform-risk redundancy factor is also developed for calculating the required design force for structures of different degrees of redundancy such that a uniform reliability requirement is satisfied.

AB - The base-isolated University of Southern California (USC) hospital building experienced strong motion during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program data of the response are available for performance evaluation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the seismic performance of the base-isolated USC hospital building during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. A nonlinear analytical model of the USC hospital building is developed and verified using system identification. The response computed, using the presented analytical modeling techniques, is verified using recorded data. Structural behavior during the Northridge earthquake is evaluated in detail. The base-isolated USC hospital building performed well and reduced the response when compared to a fixed-base structure. The free-field acceleration was 0.49g and peak foundation/ground acceleration was 0.37g. The peak roof acceleration was reduced to 0.21g, nearly 50% of the peak ground acceleration. The peak drift was &lt;30% of the code specification. The bearings yielded and dissipated energy (20%). The superstructure was elastic due to the effectiveness of base isolation. The building is expected to perform well in future earthquakes similar to those used in the original design.

AB - Identification of system parameters from seismic accelerations recorded on a base-isolated bridge provides an excellent opportunity to examine the performance of various components of such bridge systems. This study proposes a two-step system identification method for identifying structural parameters from strong motion records. The first step entails identification of complex modal parameters of a nonclassically damped base-isolated bridge-pier-pile-foundation system for which necessary theoretical formulations are first derived. In the second step a global search scheme is introduced to identify the structural parameters of the system corresponding to the identified modal parameters. The proposed system identification method is applied to two base-isolated bridges such that recorded responses at pier cap and girder are successfully recreated for one main shock and four aftershocks of the 1995 Kobe earthquake and modal and structural parameters are identified. Performance of the base-isolation system is evaluated by comparing the physical properties of the bearings, determined from experimental data, with the identified values and is found to be satisfactory in both bridges.

AB - This study first investigates how to perform the 3D dynamic analysis of buildings under the vertical component of earthquakes. The analysis results indicate that (1) dividing a main girder into two elements is required to perform the vertical earthquake analysis; (2) including secondary beams for the building analysis is similar to refine modeling of the building (at this time, one building member, such as a secondary beam or a portion of the main girder, modeled by a two-node beam element can also produce an accurate result); (3) neglecting the floor stiffness in the vertical direction is suitable, if the floor thickness is not too thick; and (4) the required vertical effective mass ratio is suggested to be 80%. In the second part of this paper, 1,080 time-history analyses and 180 static analyses of reinforced concrete buildings were performed in order to investigate the relationships of extreme column axial forces and beam moments between vertical earthquake and dead loads. The analysis results indicate that these relationships are linearly proportional to the maximum acceleration obtained from the response-spectrum figure using the first vertical frequency.

AB - A critical component in the simulation of hurricanes is a good representation of the hurricane wind field when given information of the storm intensity, size, and translation speed. In the investigation described here, the full nonlinear solution to the equations of motion of a hurricane are solved and then parameterized for use in fast-running simulations. The hurricane model described here takes into account the effects of changing sea surface roughness and the air-sea temperature difference on the estimated surface-level wind speeds. Comparisons between modeled and observed hurricane wind speed records are performed where one compares both the 10-min mean wind speeds and the peak gust wind speeds. The resulting wind field model represents the most physically based and validated model used in the estimate of hurricane wind speed exceedance probabilities.

AB - This paper describes a new technique for modeling hurricane risk in the United States. A storm track modeling approach is employed where, for each hurricane, the entire track as it crosses the ocean and makes landfall is modeled. The central pressure is modeled as a function of the sea surface temperature. The approach is validated through comparisons of simulated and observed key hurricane statistics (central pressure, translation speed, heading, and approach distance) along the U.S. coastline. The simulated and observed landfall rates of intense hurricanes (Saffir-Simpson Scale 3 and higher) also are compared on a regional basis along the coast. The model is able to reproduce the continuously varying hurricane climatology along the U.S. coastline, and it provides a rational means for examining the hurricane risk for geographically distributed systems such as transmission lines and insurance portfolios.

AB - A method of frequency domain analysis in a laboratory is presented for simulating wind vibration affecting roadside transportation structures. The approach is intended to be complementary to or in lieu of a test in a large-scale wind tunnel. A full-size two-pole roadside sign was erected in a laboratory and attached to an electromechanical actuator. Dynamic response of the structure to an impact load from the actuator was converted into the frequency domain to determine a harmonic transfer function. Records of velocities from several actual strong wind events recorded in free-field conditions were combined with drag coefficients to predict the variation of pressure on the structure. Time histories of force that are to be imposed by the actuator on the signposts were developed using frequency response functions and converting them into the frequency domain by fast Fourier transform. Results show that nearly identical structural response of a roadside sign to simulated wind events can be obtained by using an actuator in a laboratory environment.

AB - This paper presents a numerical analysis procedure for the 3D flutter analysis of bridges based on the spline finite-strip method. The finite-strip method has been extended, for the first time here, to the area of bridge aerodynamics in wind engineering. In this application, the spline finite-strip method is adopted to model the bridge girder. A significant improvement of the present formulation is that the effects of the spatial distribution of the aerodynamic forces on a bridge deck structure can be taken into account by distributing the aerodynamic forces over the cross section of the bridge deck. The flutter problem is solved by the PK-F method. Through iteration of the flutter determinant, the critical flutter wind velocity and the preflutter response of the bridge are determined. The frequencies and logarithmic decrement of the response over the range of wind velocity of interest are obtained. Numerical examples of a thin flat plate and a recently completed 423-m long-span cable-stayed bridge are presented to illustrate the reliability and accuracy of the proposed method. The results show that the present formulation has advantages over the typical equivalent beam finite-element models, particularly in the data preparation and the capability of the method to account for the spatial distribution of the aerodynamic forces across the cross section of the bridge deck. The potential of its future application is also discussed.
