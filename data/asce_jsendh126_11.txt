AB - Tests on nailed connections under static axial tension or compression loading have resulted in published limit-states design (LRFD) procedures for these types of splice connections. This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the fatigue behavior and performance of similar nailed tubular connections. A total of 24 lapped splice nailed tubular connections have been tested with variables including tube thickness, number of nails, and stress range. Five of these connections were tested under static loading to serve as a benchmark for the fatigue test series. The fatigue test series consisted of 19 specimens tested under constant amplitude fatigue loading. The performance of nailed tubular connections has consistently proven to be reliable and predictable under static and, now, fatigue loading conditions. As such, design criteria for nailed connections can be included in structural steel design specifications.

AB - This paper outlines the results from a research program aimed at studying the impact that certain features of the uniaxial material response representation of steel have on the structural behavior of compact I-shaped beams subjected to a moment gradient loading. The ductility of this structural behavior is quantified by the rotation capacity of the beam. It is shown in this work that uniaxial material response features, such as yield stress value, magnitude of strain hardening slope, and presence or absence of a yield plateau, all play fundamental roles in influencing the structural ductility of steel beam response. Two governing inelastic modal manifestations that occur in compact I-shaped beams at failure are also discussed. Although both modes display a significant degree of coupling between local and global components in the manifestations, one mode displays significantly higher capacity and structural ductility than the other. It is noted that geometric proportions of the beam alone are insufficient to predict which of the two modes govern at failure. It is concluded that, to properly account for flexural ductility in applications involving high performance steel, specifications must include provisions that ensure flexural ductility through the simultaneous consideration of geometric and material effects.

AB - When a doubly symmetric I-beam buckles elastically in a lateral-distortional mode, its web distorts, so that the two flanges have increased relative lateral displacements and may have different twist rotations. The centroid, shear center, and principal axes of the distorted cross section are all different from those of the undistorted cross section. The end connections to adjacent members may induce flange restraining moments that oppose warping deformations and modify the elastic buckling resistance. This paper investigates the effects on the lateral-distortional buckling of beams of web distortion and of the warping restraints induced by end-support conditions. It is found that a doubly symmetric I-section becomes unsymmetric during lateral-distortional buckling and that web distortion reduces the effective torsional and warping rigidities. The proposed approximations for the elastic lateral-distortional buckling resistances of beams without and with end warping restraints provide good predictions. Equations for the warping restraint stiffness induced by some commonly used end conditions are established. Comparisons with ABAQUS shell element results show that they provide good approximations.

AB - Negative bending moments arise near the intermediate supports in continuous beams; thus, when steel-concrete composite beams are considered, tensile stresses act on the concrete slab. As a result the structural response generally becomes nonlinear due to two main effects: the slip at the slab-profile interface and cracking in the concrete slab. In the present paper a method of analysis for continuous composite beams based on a specific kinematic model of the cross section is proposed. The main feature of the model is the capability to take into account the slip at the slab-profile interface and the slip at the concrete-reinforcement interface. This approach allows the introduction of a constitutive relationship for bond between reinforcing bars and concrete in the theoretical analysis; thus, the tension stiffening effect in the negative bending moment regions can be computed, and the actual mechanical behavior of reinforcing bars of the slab can be analyzed. The results of numerical analyses are compared with experimental data, showing very good agreement and the capacity of the model to simulate the main aspects of the structural behavior of composite beams.

AB - In this paper several design methods have been developed that can be used to conservatively estimate the strength of circular thin-walled concrete filled steel tubes under different loading conditions. The loading conditions examined include axial loading of the steel only, axial loading of the concrete only, and simultaneous loading of the concrete and steel both axially and at small eccentricities. Recent tests on circular concrete filled steel tubes have been used to calibrate and validate the proposed design methods. The test specimens were short with a length-to-diameter ratio of 3.5 and a diameter thickness ratio between 60 and 220. The internal concrete had nominal unconfined cylinder strengths of 50, 80, and 120 MPa. The bond (or lack of) between the steel and internal concrete was critical in determining the formation of a local buckle.

AB - Thin-walled steel box columns are vulnerable to damage caused by local and overall interaction buckling during a major earthquake. To provide enough information for a reliable and simple ductility evaluation procedure for such structures, the attention of this study is focused on the ductility capacity of thin-walled steel box stub-columns with or without longitudinal stiffeners. Combined compression and bending loads are applied to the stub-columns to simulate the loading condition under horizontal earthquake actions. Extensive parametric analyses are carried out to investigate the relation of the stub-column ductility to various parameters such as the flange width-thickness ratio, axial force, stiffener's slenderness ratio, cross-sectional shape, and column aspect ratio. An elastoplastic large deformation FEM analysis is employed and both residual stresses and initial deflections are taken into consideration. Consequently, empirical ductility formulas are proposed. Applications of the formulas to practical structures are presented in a companion paper.

AB - A rational ductility evaluation procedure for thin-walled steel structures is required to account for local buckling and to be convenient for practical use. This paper describes a simple but powerful ductility evaluation method for such structures. The method involves an elastoplastic push-over analysis and failure criterion based on the empirical ductility equations proposed for stub-columns. Local buckling is thoroughly considered in the failure criterion and can be neglected in the push-over analysis, which facilitates practical application. The implementation of the proposed procedure is demonstrated by application to the ductility evaluation of some cantilever columns and a one-story frame. The comparison between the present results and previous ductility estimations reported in the literature leads to the validation of the proposed method.

AB - The present paper concerns the calculation of stress concentration factors (SCFs) in steel multiplanar welded tubular double T- (DT-) connections, due to axial loads. SCFs are used for the prediction of the hot-spot stress, in order to assess joint structural integrity against fatigue. In the course of the present study, extensive computational research is conducted, which correlates fairly well with available experimental data, and a large SCF database for multiplanar joints is developed. SCF values are computed in characteristic locations around the welds at the chord and brace sides. Using the SCF database, a simple and efficient methodology is proposed to calculate stress concentrations in DT-joints. The important phenomenon of carryover loading, which refers to the interaction between out-of-plane braces, is examined in detail. The proposed SCF design methodology is in the form of simple equations and diagrams of the joint parameters. The out-of-plane angle ς between the two braces is shown to be a crucial parameter for the SCF value. The SCF values predicted through the parametric equations are in good agreement with the finite-element results. Finally, a methodology for predicting the hot-spot stress and the fatigue life of tubular DT-joints is presented. The design approach presented in this paper is aimed toward a more reliable, yet simple, tubular DT-joint design for structures subjected to repeated loading.

AB - A typical large-scale steel multiplanar tubular XX-joint specimen was tested with its in-plane and out-of-plane braces subjected to a total of 12 different load cases including the basic axial loads and axial load combined with the in-plane-bending or out-of-plane-bending moment. The stress concentration factors (SCFs), strain concentration factors (SNCFs), and the SCF to SNCF ratio (S/N ratio) at the potential hot spot stress locations were investigated. An average S/N ratio of 1.14 was obtained experimentally. The specimen was simulated using the finite-element method, and good agreement between the numerical and experimental SCF results was obtained. The test SCFs were also compared with those derived using the American Petroleum Institute equations, Romeijn's XX-joint equations, and the uniplanar joint solutions with the Efthymiou's influence function. Results showed that the American Petroleum Institute equations always underpredict the maximum SCFs while the other two methods always overpredict the SCFs. Further comparison study was conducted to have a better understanding of the influence of the multiplanar effects on the SCF of such a joint.

AB - Only a small fraction of the hundreds of papers published on optimization of steel structures deal with cost optimization; the great majority deal only with minimization of the weight of the structure. Those few that are concerned with cost optimization deal with small two-dimensional or academic examples. In this article, the writers present a fuzzy discrete multicriteria cost optimization model for design of space steel structures subjected to the actual constraints of commonly-used design codes such as the AISC ASD code by considering three design criteria: (1) minimum material cost; (2) minimum weight; and (3) minimum number of different section types. The computational model starts with a continuous-variable minimum weight solution with a preemptive constraint violation strategy as the lower bound followed by a fuzzy discrete multicriteria optimization. It is concluded that solving the structural design problem as a cost optimization problem can result in substantial cost savings compared with the traditional minimum weight solution, especially for large moment-resisting structures. In a 36-story moment-resisting space frame with bracings, the cost savings is in the range of 15.6–28.8%.

AB - The response prediction of geometrically nonlinear elastic structures (GNS) is an important area of research in structural engineering and mechanics. Also, in professional practice it has become mandatory to carry out such an evaluation for long-span and slender structures such as suspension bridges. However, this is often a very difficult task, especially when randomness in loads and material properties have to be taken into account. In this study, the responses of GNS are obtained using the total Lagrangian formulation for finite-element discretization. In the presence of uncertainties, the mean and variance of the response of GNS are evaluated by first-order approximation and Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the computational process and to study the effects of various parameters such as type of analysis (linear or nonlinear), magnitude of loads and load effects, and type of approximation (first order or simulation) on the main descriptors of the response of GNS. For the cases studied, the results show that first-order approximation and Monte Carlo simulation are in close agreement. This indicates that, at least for the numerical examples presented, first-order approximation can be used in place of Monte Carlo simulation. In this manner, computational time is drastically reduced without a significant loss in accuracy.

AB - This paper poses the process of structural health monitoring in the context of a statistical pattern recognition paradigm. This paper particularly focuses on applying a statistical process control (SPC) technique known as an “X-bar control chart” to vibration-based damage diagnosis. A control chart provides a statistical framework for monitoring future measurements and for identifying new data that are inconsistent with past data. First, an autoregressive (AR) model is fit to the measured time histories from an undamaged structure. Coefficients of the AR model are selected as the damage-sensitive features for the subsequent control chart analysis. Next, control limits of the X-bar control chart are constructed based on the features obtained from the initial structure. Finally, the AR coefficients of the models fit to subsequent new data are monitored relative to the control limits. A statistically significant number of features outside the control limits indicate a system transition from a healthy state to a damage state. A unique aspect of this study is the coupling of various projection techniques such as principal component analysis and linear and quadratic discriminant operators with the SPC in an effort to enhance the discrimination between features from the undamaged and damaged structures. This combined statistical procedure is applied to vibration test data acquired from a concrete bridge column as the column is progressively damaged. The coupled approach captures a clearer distinction between undamaged and damaged vibration responses than by applying an SPC alone.

AB - In this paper, possible solutions to the constraints of flat space frames in large spans are summarized, including the application of multilayer forms, the introduction of novel simplexes, and the improvement in structural components. Then the base-reinforced pyramid (BP) system, which is formed by reinforcing the base of a rectangular pyramid by crossing bars, is introduced as a successful attempt to reduce maximum bar forces in double-layer space frames without densifying grids. Properties of the BP system are reviewed. Super bar theory is introduced to cope with the buckling and large internal forces of long bars. Therefore, large grids can be realized in super span flat space frames with lightweight and large clear space. Under this concept, either a reciprocal prism or, generally, its derivatives, which are composed of much shorter bars, replace long bars. Factors affecting the efficiency of super bars are analyzed in detail, and their joint design is also recommended. Details of designing bars are clarified. The efficiency of a 200-m-span flat double-layer BP grid employing super bars as long components is proven by case studies. Finally, a new concept with reduced cross-section is developed for a super bar system to achieve a further reduction in weight.
