AB - This state-of-the-art paper offers a comprehensive overview of the modeling techniques used for the analysis of posttensioned structures. The merits and limitations of each of the modeling schemes are discussed within a consistent and comparative framework. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the tacit features of the models. The balanced loading, primary actions, hyperstatic (secondary) actions, and prestressing moment concepts commonly used in the analysis of prestressed structures are revisited and clarified. The work concludes with an example of the most recent modeling technology—the discrete modeling of tendons. The example illustrates the calculation of long-term prestress losses as an integral part of the analysis as opposed to the traditional approach where long-term losses are computed independently from the solution.

AB - Grout mixes using commercially available antibleed admixtures were tested for fresh properties and subsequently corrosion tested using anodic polarization to accelerate the corrosion process. Commercial admixtures that are intended to improve the corrosion protection provided by the grout were also tested in grout mixes containing the antibleed admixture. From a comparison, it was found that the antibleed admixture reduced the corrosion protection of the grout and a mix with no antibleed admixture did not. It was also found that one corrosion protection admixture improved protection while the other admixture reduced protection provided by the grout. Because the accelerated tests were conducted at an artificially high potential of 600 mV, there is some concern that the polarization level at the strand will differ significantly among grouts with varying ohmic resistances. Potentiodynamic tests were conducted on selected specimens, to investigate this effect, and were inconclusive. Further study into this effect is recommended before the higher polarization levels are used to evaluate grouts that having varying ohmic resistances.

AB - This paper describes a method of statistical analysis and a sensitivity analysis of the effects of creep and shrinkage in prestressed concrete (PSC) box girder bridges. Three possible sources of the uncertainties of the structural response have been taken into account—creep and shrinkage model uncertainty, parameter variation, and environmental conditions. The statistical and sensitivity analyses are performed using the Latin hypercube sampling method. For each sample, a time-dependent structural analysis is performed to produce response data, which are then analyzed statistically. Two measures are examined to quantify the sensitivity of the outputs to each of the input variables. These are the partial rank correlation coefficient and the standardized rank regression coefficient computed on the ranks of the observations. To apply the proposed method to a real structure, the uncertainty and sensitivity of the time-dependent axial shortening of a PSC box girder bridge are analyzed. The results indicate that the creep model uncertainty factor and relative humidity appear to be the most dominant factors with regard to the model output uncertainty. The method identifies the most important factors in the long-term prediction of structural response in PSC box girder bridges and provides a realistic method to determine the uncertainty analysis of those structures.

AB - Unbalanced moments are transferred between columns and flat plates as a result of pattern gravity loading or lateral forces due to wind and earthquakes. Shear stresses produced by moment transfer must be considered in the punching design of column-slab connections as they can be significant, particularly during earthquakes. According to the ACI 318-95 code, a fraction of the unbalanced moment is assumed to be transferred by shear stresses in the slab. The code gives an empirical equation for this fraction; the equation is applicable for the first rectangular shear critical section adjacent to faces of a rectangular interior column. Other equations, for the fraction of moment transferred by shear stresses, which are applicable for shear critical sections of any shape have been developed by earlier researchers based on linear finite-element analyses supplemented by experimental results. These equations are calibrated in the present paper using nonlinear finite-element analyses. 3D finite-elements are employed; thus flexural reinforcing bars running parallel to the slab surface as well as shear reinforcement standing in the direction of the normal to the slab surface can be modeled. The finite-element model is validated, and the analysis results indicate that equations developed by earlier researchers, for the fraction of moment transferred by slab shear stresses, are adequate.

AB - A research project is currently being conducted to evaluate a new reinforcement detailing in frame corners in civil defense shelters where all reinforcement bars are spliced within the frame corner. As part of this, full-scale frame corners subjected to negative bending moment were tested and analyzed using the nonlinear finite-element program DIANA. A concrete material model based on nonlinear fracture mechanics to take cracking into account and plasticity models for concrete in compression and reinforcement steel were used. An interface model accounted for the bond-slip relation between reinforcement and surrounding concrete. Parameters that varied in the study were reinforcement detailing, reinforcement ratio, the effects of the weakness of the construction joint, and the interaction between reinforcement and concrete. Tests and finite-element analyses support the idea that the new reinforcement detailing is appropriate to use. Furthermore, it was found that the effect on the maximum load capacity of different bond-slip relations, the weakness of the construction joint, and incorrect positioning of the reinforcement bars in the corner were negligible.

AB - To investigate whether the current numerical models and procedures are capable of realistically predicting compression failure of concrete structures, RILEM TC 148SSC recently proposed a so-called round-robin analysis for over-reinforced concrete beams. Beams of two different sizes made of three different concrete types (normal-strength, high-strength, and fiber-reinforced concrete) were proposed to be studied numerically. In the present paper the results of a 3D finite-element analysis are shown, discussed, and compared with the test results. The analysis was performed before the test data were available. After the experimental results were known, additional parameter study was carried out. The microplane model for concrete was employed within the framework of the crack band theory. The comparison between measured and calculated data exhibits good agreement. It is confirmed that the finite-element code based on the smeared fracture analysis is able to realistically predict compression failure of concrete beams. The results show that the relative resistance of beams made of different concrete types is not proportional to the uniaxial compressive strength. The efficiency of high-strength concrete is much lower than the efficiency of normal-strength concrete. It is shown that the size effect on the strength of normal-strength concrete beams that fail in compression is relatively small. However, the size effect on the postpeak response is stronger.

AB - This paper presents design charts constructed from the softened truss model to facilitate the torsional design of reinforced concrete rectangular members. These design charts comprise a normalized failure mode diagram and a strength contour diagram. Given a reinforced concrete rectangular section, the former diagram can be used to determine the corresponding failure mode and the latter one the strength. These diagrams are plotted on the plane of two newly defined reinforcement indices including the longitudinal and transverse steel indices, which are introduced so that the design charts are independent of the section dimensions, the yield strength of reinforcement, and the compressive strength of concrete. The accuracy of the proposed design charts in the prediction of the failure mode and the torsional strength is comparable to that of the softened truss model, as demonstrated in the presented example, whereas the design charts are more computation efficient for use by designers than the softened truss model.

AB - This paper presents the results of an experimental study of reinforced concrete waffle slabs with a square layout of ribs. Tests to failure were carried out on eight large-scale (1/4-in. scale) models with varied rib spacing and rib depth. The validity of the “equivalent thickness” concept was also examined by testing two related slabs. The results for the rigidities in the elastic-uncracked and elastic-cracked ranges were compared with predicted values obtained from three different methods. The theoretical analysis based on the conventional orthotropic plate theory gave satisfactory predictions but involves an elaborate procedure for determining the torsional rigidities. The equivalent thickness approach, which was modified to apply to the cracked as well as the uncracked ranges, gave moderately higher values for the rigidity than test results. An alternative simplified approximate method based on the “effective modulus of elasticity” is also proposed. Predictions for the rigidities by the proposed method were on the safe side and reasonably close to test results.

AB - The impact-echo method is a promising technique for the detection of damage in concrete structures, particularly when applied to plate-like structures. However, when the technique is applied to beam-like rather than plate-like structures the resulting amplitude spectra are complex and difficult to interpret. The complications are due to the excitation of cross-sectional modes of vibration in the beam. This paper discusses an investigation into the nature of these modes, shows that their frequency is lowered by the presence of a large void, and discusses the potential of using these modes for nondestructive testing. Plane strain finite-element models have been used to model cross-sectional modes in the presence of both grouted and ungrouted ducts. The results from these analyses are described together with an experimental validation using a beam containing a large duct, some of which is grouted and some of which contains a void. Results are compared with previous analytical findings and found to be in agreement.

AB - Water pressure in propagating concrete cracks is experimentally and numerically investigated. Ultimate application of this study is the uplift pressure in a concrete gravity dam during and after an earthquake. Numerous tests were conducted on wedge splitting specimens with hydrostatic pressure along the crack. Relative velocities of water front versus crack front as well as the effect of sudden crack closure have been investigated. It was observed that, for the tested specimens, the crack opening rate has important consequences on the internal water pressure distribution. If the crack opening rate is slow enough, the water pressure has time to develop, whereas under fast crack openings the water front cannot keep up with the crack front. Furthermore, upon sudden crack closure the trapped water acts as a wedge causing tensile stresses in the specimen. Finally, on the basis of the experimental observations, a model for the conductivity of cracked concrete is developed. Such a model could then be used in the coupled transient finite-element analysis of a concrete dam subjected to an earthquake.

AB - Beams of high-strength concrete (fcc up to 90 MPa) were tested in shear and bending. Various types of fiber (metallic and nonmetallic) were added to the concrete matrix to up to 1% per volume concrete. Also, four different beam depths were investigated. The efficiency of fibers depends on the governing load-carrying mechanisms, which may vary for different beam dimensions. The chosen steel fibers did not improve the capacity of the 250 mm deep beams as they did for some of the 300 mm beams. They enhanced the toughness in the 500 mm beams, but were not enough for the 700 mm beams. Also, a fiber cocktail may prove more effective than using a single type of fiber. The chosen steel fibers are competitive with conventional stirrups, according to this study. A nonlinear truss model is devised to predict the load-carrying capacity of the beams. The model gave good predictions for beams without stirrups and depths up to 500 mm.

AB - Bridges are indispensable components of the infrastructure of modern society, and their assessment via techniques of structural dynamics is assuming greater importance. This assessment concerns performance of the as-built structure compared to the design and can also extend to the assessment of structural deterioration or damage. Simple validation of numerical results by dynamic testing has met some success; however, feedback from testing into analysis is usually crude, and only recently have systematic techniques been developed that can be supplied to such structures. This paper investigates the application of sensitivity-based model updating technology to the dynamic assessment of the Safti Link Bridge, a curved cable-stayed bridge in Singapore. Based on the measured modal data from prototype testing, the simulated dynamic properties obtained via finite-element analysis have been significantly improved by modification of uncertain structural parameters such as Young's modulus of concrete and structural geometry.

AB - In this paper, the use of localized tendons to prestress statically indeterminate structures is examined. To determine the prestressing moments produced by localized tendons, the fixed-end moments should first be computed. Equations and charts are presented to show the effects on these moments of varying the geometric parameters that define the localized tendon profile. These equations and charts are helpful for selecting the values of the parameters before using computer programs to obtain the resultant prestressing moment at any section of the structure.

AB - The large deflection behavior of a uniaxially bent beam-column subject to an eccentrically applied load is investigated. A closed-form expression for the total lateral deflection, including bowing and initial imperfection, is derived by adopting a nonlinear strain-displacement relationship and a sine curve approximation for the lateral deflection. Stability is checked by evaluating the Hessian matrix of the total potential energy. The formulation is validated by applying it to a steel beam-column with an L/r ratio of 200. Though not comprehensive, results indicate that it is possible to develop reasonable closed-form solutions for the nonlinear behavior of slender beam-columns.
