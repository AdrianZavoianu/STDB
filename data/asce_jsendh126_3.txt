AB - In steel construction, sometimes bolts and welds must be combined in a single joint. Provisions for the design of these combination joints can be found in existing specifications, but the design rules generally have not been verified by physical tests. In addition, the rules appear to be illogical in some cases. An experimental study using full-scale tension lap splices that combined high-strength bolts and fillet welds was carried out in order to develop a better understanding of combination joints. The results showed that the orientation of the welds and the bearing condition of the bolts are two key factors that must be considered when determining the extent of load sharing in combination joints. Design recommendations based on the results of this study are presented.

AB - To ensure that accurate failure-mode assessments are made, and ultimately to ensure that accurate design equations are formulated, a detailed analysis is needed of the procedure used to identify the cause of a connection failure. Misidentification of failure modes and the misuse of data can lead to serious errors in the accuracy and applicability of design equations. The load-capacity formulations presented in the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) Specification cannot be used to accurately predict the failure modes of thin cold-formed sheet-steel bolted connections that are loaded in shear. A modification to the bearing-coefficient provisions, to account for the reduced bearing resistance of the connected materials, is necessary and has been proposed by the writers in recent papers. A revision of the net-section fracture design method is also required. Recommendations concerning the procedure that is used to identify the net-section fracture and bearing-failure modes are made in this paper.

AB - This paper describes tests on various types of knee joints for steel portal frames constructed from cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS) to examine the ability of the connections to form plastic hinges. Welded stiffened and unstiffened knee joints, bolted knee joints with end plates, and connections with a fabricated internal sleeve were included in the experimental investigation. Most connections tested under opening moment failed by fracture in the heat-affected zone of the RHS near the weld. The connections tested under closing moment failed by web local buckling, which occurred near the connection. While the stiffened and unstiffened welded connections satisfied the strength interaction requirements in the available design guides, the connections did not maintain the plastic moment for sufficiently large rotations to be considered suitable for a plastic hinge location. The unstiffened welded joints were not able to reach the plastic moment. The use of an internal sleeve moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection center-line and reduced the stress on the weld between the legs of the connection. It was found that sleeve connections were capable of sustaining the plastic moment for large rotations considered suitable for plastic design.

AB - Welding-induced residual stresses are usually regarded as secondary stresses and therefore not accounted for in the structural analysis. This treatment, however, was brought into question with the welding research community by the discovery of a widespread structural damage in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Brittle fracture was identified in many of the prequalified weld joints in steel moment frames. Welding-induced residual stresses are believed to be one of the factors contributing to the brittle fracture. In this paper, a detailed investigation on residual stresses in welded moment frame connections is presented. Both the actual connection configurations of the moment resistant frames and local weld details are considered by means of advanced residual stress analysis techniques. Then, the effects of triaxial residual stress state on plastic deformation capacity are discussed based on finite-element results on a wide-plate specimen loaded in tension. Finally, a series of fracture mechanics analyses were carried out to assess the effects of residual stresses on the fracture behavior. As a result, a great deal of insight has been obtained on the fracture behavior of the moment frame welds. Among other things, the results indicate that welding-induced residual stresses significantly increase the fracture driving force due to the presence of high tensile residual stresses. The high triaxial residual stress states identified in these joints can greatly reduce the plastic deformation capability, consequently promoting brittle fracture. Therefore, it seems reasonable to postulate that weld residual stresses could have played an important role in the occurrence of brittle fracture in the pre-Northridge weld joints.

AB - A series of tests has been conducted on 12 short-span, slender steel-plate girders to investigate the ultimate resistance of the web panels to shear loading, patch loading, and combined shear-and-patch loading. Failure of web panels subjected to shear loading occurred in a typical shear-sway mode, while failure of web panels subjected to patch loading occurred in a typical web-crippling mode. Failure of web panels subjected to combined shear-and-patch loading occurred in a combination of shear-sway and web-crippling modes. All the web panels tested exhibited reasonably stable postpeak load behavior. Theoretical predictions of ultimate shear and patch resistance, based on existing ultimate limit-state theories, show close correlation with the test data presented. Analysis of the test results for combined shear-and-patch loading indicates significant interaction between the two forms of loading. An interaction formula for this combined loading is proposed that shows satisfactory correlation with the presented test data.

AB - Changeable message sign (CMS) structures are cantilever, interverted L-shaped structural components that are used to transmit information on road conditions to the driving public. The high-cycle fatigue failure of one CMS structure in southern California led to a detailed analytical and experimental study of CMS structures. In this paper key data from field studies are presented together with results of finite-element studies of CMS structural components. A companion paper documents the results of the experimental program and presents recommendations for future CMS construction. Analysis of field data shows mechanical damping in CMS structures to be approximately 0.5% of critical in the first two modes and that galloping instability was probably the cause of failure of the CMS structure. Finite-element models were developed for one as-built post, one gusset-retrofitted post, and different conduit hole geometries. The finite-element analysis showed that there were high stress concentrations around the conduit holes in all cases, that conduit hole geometry appears to play only a small role in the value of maximum stress, and that the gussets served to reduce the longitudinal and von Mises stresses at the post-baseplate weldment but not around the conduit hole where the gussets created stress risers at the gusset tip.

AB - Changeable message signs (CMS) are supported by cantilevered, inverted L-shaped structural components composed of a vertical post and a horizontal mast arm. The high-cycle fatigue failure of one CMS structure in southern California led to a detailed analytical and experimental study of components of CMS structures. This paper reports the results of the experimental studies and presents recommendations for future CMS construction. A companion paper documents the results of the field studies and finite-element analysis of components of CMS structures. Six cantilever specimens were tested to failure: one as-built post (AB1); two retrofitted posts (GR1 and CIP1); and three mast arms (MA1, MA2, and MA3). The specimens were tested at a stress range of 69+ MPa (10+ ksi). The fatigue life of all six specimens exceeded the AASHTO design fatigue life of 400,000 cycles for a stress range of 69 MPa. Alternate construction details; improved welding, fabrication, and quality assurance/quality control practices; additional field and wind-tunnel testing; and further laboratory experimentation are recommended.

AB - Concrete filled steel box columns have recently experienced a renaissance in their use throughout the world. This has occurred due to the significant advantages that the construction method can provide. This paper deals with the strength behavior of short columns under the combined actions of axial compression and bending moment. The paper addresses the effect of steel plate slenderness limits on this behavior. An extensive set of experiments has been carried out and a numerical model developed elsewhere is augmented and calibrated with these results. A simple model for the determination of the strength-interaction diagram is also verified against both the test results and the numerical model developed in this paper. This model, based on the rigid plastic method of analysis, is existent in international codes of practice, but does not account for the effects of local buckling, which are found to be significant with large plate slenderness values, particularly for large values of axial force. Thus some suggested modifications are proposed to allow for the inclusion of slender plated columns in design.

AB - Within the activities of CEN-TC250/SC9, the technical committee charged with the preparation of Eurocode 9 on Aluminum Structures, an extensive experimental program devoted to the evaluation of the ultimate resistance of aluminum alloy hollow members subjected to local buckling under uniform compression has been recently completed. The experimental program concerns both rectangular hollow sections and square hollow sections made of 6000-series alloys and produced by the major European aluminum industries. These experimental tests have provided a significant amount of data concerning the influence of the b/t (width-to-thickness) ratios on the local buckling resistance of members. On the basis of the obtained results, an empirical formulation for predicting the average strain corresponding to the ultimate resistance is derived and a new classification criterion accounting for the interaction between the two slenderness parameters of the cross section is proposed. Finally, the obtained results are used in setting up a new method for predicting the stable part of the rotation capacity of aluminum alloy beams subjected to non-uniform bending.

AB - Self-erecting structures eliminate the need for expensive scaffolding and are safer and faster to construct. This paper deals with the application of nonlinear analysis to study the erection of space trusses by tensioning of cables placed inside some chord members. Based on the study, the criteria and parameters that govern and influence the erection of a framework are identified. The arrangement of cables and the magnitude of tensioning forces need to be predetermined based on the final structural configuration to be achieved. A special program has been developed to examine the precise conditions under which self-erection is possible, and whether or not the erection process induces self-equilibrium internal stress states at each incremental step. Several examples, including square-grid and hexagonal-grid space trusses, have been considered for the study. It is found that Maxwell's rule governing the requirement of number of joints, members, and kinematic constraints at the supports of a structural assembly is not sufficient to determine the feasibility of erection by cable-tensioning. The proposed analysis technique and procedure is capable of simulating the erection process and, at the same time, monitoring the stability condition of the structure during the self-erecting process.

AB - This paper presents an inelastic beam element for the analysis of steel-concrete girders with partial composite action under monotonic and cyclic loads. The element is derived from a two-field mixed formulation with independent approximation of internal forces and transverse displacements. The nonlinear response of the steel and concrete component of the girder is based on the section discretization into fibers with uniaxial hysteretic material models for the constituent materials. The partial interaction between concrete deck and steel girder through shear connectors is accounted for by an interface model with distributed force transfer characteristics. A direct state determination algorithm for the implementation of the composite element in a general purpose nonlinear analysis program is presented, and the stability characteristics of the algorithm are discussed in conjunction with the selection of appropriate force and displacement interpolation functions. The validity of the model is established by correlation of analytical results with experimental evidence. Numerical studies are used to compare the model with the classical displacement formulation. These studies confirm the superiority of the proposed model in modeling composite girders under monotonic and cyclic loads that induce stiffness deterioration and strength softening.

AB - In this paper we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization procedure for the design of 2D, geometrical, nonlinear steel-framed structures. The approach presented uses GAs as a tool to achieve discrete nonlinear optimal or near-optimal designs. Frames are designed in accordance with the requirements of the AISC-LRFD specification. In this paper, we employ a group selection mechanism, discuss an improved adapting crossover operator, and provide recommendations on the penalty function selection. We compare the differences between optimized designs obtained by linear and geometrically nonlinear analyses. Through two examples, we will illustrate that the optimal designs are not affected significantly by the P-Δ effects. However, in some cases we may achieve a better design by performing nonlinear analysis instead of linear analysis.

AB - A three-dimensional, nonlinear finite-element procedure for modeling composite and steel-framed building behavior in fire is presented. In this approach, composite steel-framed buildings are modeled as an assembly of finite beam-column, spring, and slab elements. The beam-columns are represented by two-noded line elements. The cross section of the element is divided into a number of segments to allow consideration of temperature, stress, and strain through the cross section. A two-noded spring element of zero length is used to model the characteristics of steel member connections. The slabs are modeled by using a layered flat shell element based on Mindlin/Reissner theory, in which each layer can have a different temperature and material properties. Predictions from the model are compared with experimental results, both from isolated element tests and from a major full-scale fire test performed in the experimental composite building at Cardington. The model is clearly capable of predicting the response of composite steel-framed buildings in fire with reasonable accuracy. The procedure has been found to have good computational stability, which is very important in the context of problems incorporating very large deformations.

AB - A simple and direct analytical formula has been derived to determine the compressive resistance of steel columns subjected to fire conditions. The approach is based on the Rankine principle, which allows the strength and the stability of a steel column at a particular temperature to be separately determined. Here, the evaluation of column strength is based on the rigid-plastic theory, while the stability consideration is based on the elastic-buckling theory. By considering the two factors in this manner, the proposed approach allows for their interaction. One important feature is that the same analytical formula can be used for both axially and eccentrically loaded columns. In addition, the proposed formula does not require any calibrations against test data. The proposed formula has been verified against a set of published column test results and other analytical predictions. The comparison study shows consistently good agreement with both the test and the analytical results.

AB - This paper presents the results of a study pertaining to the short-term behavior of concentrically loaded single angle members made of pultruded fiber-reinforced polymeric materials. Seven E-glass/polyester and 18 E-glass/vinylester angle specimens having slenderness ratios ranging from 30 to 105 and leg width-to-thickness ratios of 8, 10.7, 12, 16, and 24 were tested. Tests have shown that under compression loading, pultruded angles reinforced with E-glass roving and nonwoven E-glass strand mats buckle in either flexural or flexural-torsional modes. These experimentally observed buckling modes were also predicted analytically, based on derived mathematical models that describe the buckling behavior of a specially orthotropic, centrally loaded, equal-leg angle section. Compression and in-plane shear coupon tests were conducted to characterize the material. The results were analyzed statistically to obtain the 95% lower confidence limit on the 5th percentile strength and modulus values, which in turn were used in the analytical buckling formulae to correlate the experimental to the analytical buckling loads. Finally, load and resistance factor design equations with a target reliability index of 3 for buckling and 4 for material compressive strength limit states are proposed.

AB - In this paper, the response variability of a reinforced concrete cooling tower shell due to shape imperfections is investigated, based on statistical stochastic analysis. In general, shape imperfections are modeled as ideal shapes, such as axisymmetric cosine shape and/or cyclic shape imperfections. However, these kinds of idealized imperfections cannot well enough represent the real shape imperfections in actual cooling tower shells. In this study, the shape imperfection of the cooling tower is assumed to be globally distributed stochastic fields rather than localized ones. The two geometrical parameters, i.e., thickness and radius, of a cooling tower shell are chosen as the spatially varying stochastic fields with predetermined statistical terms. The amount of additional responses revealed that the coefficients of variation (COVs) of stresses are larger than those of displacements, and that the additional response due to randomness in the cooling tower radius is larger than that in the shell thickness. The COVs of these two parameters show quite opposite trends. As the type of stochastic field approaches white noise, the response variability is decreased in the case of randomness in thickness, but increased in the case of radius.
