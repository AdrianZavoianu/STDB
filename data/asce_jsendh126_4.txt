AB - This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation into the seismic performance of a composite moment resisting frame system that consists of reinforced concrete columns (with an embedded steel shape for erection purposes) and composite steel beam-reinforced concrete slab sections. Quasi-static reversed cyclic loading was performed on six two-thirds-scale subassemblage specimens. Various detailing options were evaluated to provide full moment connection in both orthogonal framing directions at the beam-column joints. With appropriate joint detailing, specimens exhibited a desirable beam plastic hinge mechanism with stable hysteretic response. Composite beam sections maintained near full composite behavior beyond code based drift limits with good energy dissipation characteristics and were able to undergo large plastic rotation magnitudes. This framing system may represent a viable alternative for low-to-mid-rise structures in high seismic risk zones.

AB - An experimental and analytical study is presented that investigates the effectiveness of a supplemental damping system consisting of elastomeric spring dampers (ESD) and fuse-bars to mitigate the seismic response of steel structures. Steel structures generally possess significant flexibility and relatively low inherent viscous damping. Under strong earthquake ground shaking, large interstory drifts can be expected which in turn cause distress to both structural and nonstructural elements. In this study, a load-balancing tendon fuse+damper (TFD) system has been adopted, where sacrificial yielding fuse-bars are used parallel to ESD devices to initially help stiffen the structure. A total of seven different configurations were tested with various bracing as well as supplemental damping systems. It was both experimentally observed and analytically shown that the proposed supplemental tendon system significantly attenuates the overall seismic response of the structure. An improved velocity-dependent computational model for the ESD devices is presented and verified. Hence, benefits of using a load balancing–draped tendon profile are analytically investigated.

AB - An experimental program was undertaken to evaluate methods to retrofit existing steel moment connections for improved seismic performance. Six full-scale subassemblages were tested under cyclic loading. Typical pre-Northridge connections were retrofit by the addition of either a bottom flange dogbone or a welded bottom flange haunch. Retrofitted specimens were tested both with and without a composite floor slab. The tests showed poor performance of the bottom flange dogbone retrofit when the existing low toughness welds were left in place. Somewhat improved performance was observed when the bottom flange dogbone was combined with replacement of beam flange groove welds with higher toughness welds. The welded bottom haunch retrofit showed excellent performance on specimens with a composite slab, even though the existing low toughness beam flange groove welds were left in place. The presence of the composite slab appeared to help prevent fracture of the existing top flange weld in the haunch retrofit. This paper provides a summary of the complete experimental program.

AB - In the last few decades, steel plate shear walls have been introduced as primary lateral load resisting elements in several buildings around the world. This paper presents research from a study on the performance of unstiffened thin steel plate shear walls for medium- and high-rise buildings. In this concept, the postbuckling strength of the panels is relied upon for most of the frame shear resistance, similar to the slender web of a plate girder. Experimental testing was conducted on two single- and one four-story steel shear wall specimens, under cyclic quasi-static loading. Each specimen consisted of a single bay with column-to-column and floor-to-floor dimensions of 900 mm, representing a quarter-scale model of a typical office building core. Identification of load-deformation characteristics and the stresses induced in the structural components were the primary objectives of the testing program. Good energy dissipation and displacement ductility capacities were achieved. Primary inelastic damage modes included yielding of the infill plates combined with column yielding in the single-panel tests and yielding of the columns for the multistory frame. The experimental results were compared with simplified tension field analytical models, based on recommendations in the Canadian code for limit-states design of steel structures. The models, in general, provided good predictions of the postyield strength of the specimens, with less satisfactory results for elastic stiffness calculations. From the experimental and analytical results, the adequacy of existing design guidelines were assessed.

AB - An approximate formulation to determine the amount of transverse reinforcement for columns of reinforced concrete (RC) frames in seismic areas is presented. It is based on observations that suggested that the main function of transverse reinforcement is to confine the core subjected to a complex state of stress rather than simply resist shear or improve deformability under axial compression. The combined effects of shear and axial stresses are assumed to be a function of the maximum drift ratio and they are interpreted using Coulomb's failure criterion. A comparison between results obtained with the model developed and current design recommendations suggests that the required amount of transverse reinforcement specified in ACI 318-95 can be reduced safely for “flexible” columns (ratio of column height to effective depth ≅6) under low amplitude displacement cycles (ratio of lateral displacement to column height ≤3%) and “short” columns (ratio of column height to effective depth ≅4) under combinations of relatively low shear and axial stresses.

AB - In the design or analysis of structures for seismic loads, the effects of forces acting simultaneously in a member must be considered. The most common example is in the interaction of bending moments and axial load in columns. The usual response spectrum method provides the maximum values of individual responses, but the critical combination of these responses may not involve any of these maxima. In this paper, a response-spectrum-based procedure for predicting the envelope that bounds two or more responses in a linear structure is developed. It is shown that, for an assumed orientation of the principal axes along which the ground motion components are uncorrelated, this envelope is an ellipsoid. For the case when the orientation of the principal axes is unknown, a “supreme” envelope is derived, which corresponds to the most critical orientation of the axes. The response envelope can be superimposed on a capacity curve to determine the adequacy of a given design. In a companion paper, the results of a numerical study are presented to illustrate the accuracy and significance of this method.

AB - In a companion paper, a response-spectrum-based procedure for predicting the envelope that bounds the simultaneous action of two or more seismic responses was developed. In the present paper, we evaluate the accuracy of the procedure and investigate its influence on the design of structural elements subjected to seismic loads. The accuracy of the proposed envelope is examined by means of comparison with time-history analyses using simulated and recorded ground motions. It is found that the proposed envelope has a level of accuracy that is commensurate with its response spectrum bases. The significance of the proposed envelope is demonstrated by designing the columns of an example reinforced concrete structure by the proposed and conventional methods. In particular, the required reinforcement ratio for each column is determined by superimposing the response envelope that bounds the axial force and biaxial bending moments acting in the column onto a prescribed moment-axial capacity surface. Savings as high as 50% in the required reinforcement ratio are gained by use of the proposed method.

AB - Investigated in this paper is the approximation in the ATC-40 nonlinear static procedure (NSP) that the earthquake-induced deformation of an inelastic single-degree-of-freedom (SDF) system can be estimated by an iterative method requiring analysis of a sequence of equivalent linear systems. Several deficiencies in the ATC-40 Procedure A are demonstrated. This iterative procedure did not converge for some of the systems analyzed. It converged in many cases, but to a deformation much different than dynamic (nonlinear response history or inelastic design spectrum) analysis of the inelastic system. The ATC-40 Procedure B always gives a unique value of deformation, same as that determined by Procedure A if it converged. These approximate procedures underestimate significantly the deformation for a wide range of periods and ductility factors with errors approaching 50%, implying that the estimated deformation is about half the “exact” value. Surprisingly, the ATC-40 procedures are deficient relative to even the elastic design spectrum in the velocity-sensitive and displacement-sensitive regions of the spectrum. For systems with a period in these regions, the peak deformation of an inelastic system can be estimated from the elastic design spectrum using the well-known equal displacement rule. However, the approximate procedure requires analyses of several equivalent linear systems and still produces worse results.

AB - Use of passive energy dissipators is emerging as an accepted practice for the seismic design and retrofit of civil engineering structures. One such new device, based on a self-centering friction mechanism is investigated in this paper. This device uses ring springs, also known as friction springs, as the key components to dissipate seismic-induced energy. Results of characterization tests performed on a 200-kN capacity damper prototype and shake table tests on a half-scale moment-resisting steel frame equipped with the same damper prototype are presented. Results of the shake table tests are also compared with numerical predictions. The results of the characterization tests showed that the force-displacement hysteresis loops of the damper were self-centering, repeatable, stable, identical in tension-compression, and nearly identical for all frequencies considered. In the shake table tests, the damper was effective in reducing the lateral displacements of the test structure. The damper was also efficient in reducing acceleration levels under earthquake intensity that caused slight yielding of the structure without a damper.

AB - The collapse of bridges due to unseating at intermediate (in-span) hinges during recent earthquakes emphasizes the need to provide an adequate number of restrainers to limit the relative displacement between frames in a bridge with inadequate hinge seat width. Current restrainer design procedures do not account for the factors affecting the earthquake response of multiple-frame bridges. A parameter study indicates that maximum hinge displacement is a function of the frame period ratio, frame ductility, and the characteristics of the ground motion. A new design procedure for hinge restrainers, based on a linearized model, is developed. The procedure accounts for the dynamic characteristics out-of-phase motion of adjacent bridge frames. Inelastic behavior of frames is accounted for by using the substitute structure method. Parameter studies and case studies using over 26 different ground motion records show that the new procedure limits and the relative hinge displacement to a designer-specified value for a wide range of bridges.

AB - An analytical model based on a Winkler beam is used to represent the lateral force response of a reinforced concrete (RC) pile in cohesionless soil. An inelastic finite-element analysis was performed on the structure, using as the pile constitutive model the section moment-curvature relationship based on confined stress-strain relationships for the concrete. Parameters varied were pile head restraint (free and fixed head), height of pile head above grade level, and soil stiffness. Linear, bilinear, and hyperbolic soil models were examined. The analysis showed that shear would be significantly underpredicted by an elastic analysis, as inelastic behavior moved the point of maximum moment in the pile shaft closer to the surface, thus reducing the shear span. Maximum moment depth in the pile shaft and plastic hinge length were also shown to be strongly dependent on soil stiffness, and in the case of fixed-head piles, on abovegrade height of the superstructure. Linear soil models were shown to be adequate for most cases of pile/column design.

AB - The purpose of this paper is to present shake table experiments conducted on four 3.4-m-high plain concrete gravity dam models to study their dynamic cracking and sliding responses. The experimental results are then compared with a smeared cracked finite-element simulation using a nonlinear concrete constitutive model based on fracture mechanics. For the sliding mechanism, the numerical simulations use rigid body dynamics with frictional strength derived from the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. From the cracking tests, it is shown that a single triangular acceleration pulse could initiate and propagate a crack. The numerical correlation with the observed response is good. However, viscous damping varies experimentally from 1% in an uncracked situation to over 20% in a partially cracked case. For the sliding mechanism when the critical acceleration is exceeded, it is shown experimentally that sliding could occur due to a single triangular acceleration pulse. For actual seismic records, the cumulative sliding displacement for a given peak ground acceleration due to low frequency western North American records can be 3–4 times larger than the corresponding sliding displacements due to high frequency eastern records. For simplified pseudostatic or pseudodynamic sliding analyses, the concept of an effective acceleration is developed.

AB - Dynamic characteristics of a traffic signal structure were determined experimentally. Various strategies were investigated to provide additional damping. By decreasing the magnitude and the number of fatigue cycles caused by wind-induced oscillations, the service life is expected to be extended. Several damping devices were investigated and tested. The free-vibration response was used to determine the in- and out-of-plane damping of a full-scale pole with and without dampers. The dampers included elastomeric pads located within the joints, several impact dampers, tuning-mass systems, and a mechanical shock absorber (with a strut) positioned between the luminaire extension and the mast arm. An elastomeric pad located at the pole foundation connection and the shock absorber exhibited the most damping and were considered viable and practical options. The construction characteristics of each damper were noted.

AB - Wind-induced internal pressures have been measured at the Wind Engineering Research Field Laboratory full-scale low-rise test building at Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Tex., and compared with theoretical analysis. The pressure inside the building was controlled by the external pressure distribution, position and size of openings, volume of the building, and the flexibility of the envelope. The mean and fluctuating internal pressures in the nominally sealed building were smaller than the pressures on the external surfaces, and they increase with increasing windward/leeward open area ratio. Internal pressure resonance occurs close to the Helmholtz frequency in the building with a dominant opening. Effects of the flexibility of the envelope on the internal pressure fluctuations were accounted for by increasing the volume of the building by a factor of the bulk modulus of air KA to the bulk modulus of the building KB. External pressures on selected parts of the building and measured internal pressures were combined to study the characteristics of the net pressures acting on cladding elements, and they were compared with data derived from the AS1170.2 wind load standard. AS1170.2 generally provides satisfactory net pressure estimates for design of cladding on a nominally sealed building but can underestimate net cladding design pressures on some small tributary areas of a building with a dominant windward wall opening.

AB - The definition of Exposure D in ASCE 7 along the hurricane coastline does not take into account the increase in the roughness of the ocean with increasing wind speeds, the age of waves, or the changes in the wave characteristics as they approach the coast. This note reviews some of the more recent research associated with the roughness of wind-driven waves. One specific observation is that waves produced near the center of a hurricane are young waves, which exhibit a higher aerodynamic roughness than do the mature waves often associated with “straight-line” winds. A second observation is that, as waves approach the shore, they become steeper and thus exhibit a higher aerodynamic roughness. These observations suggest that, in design events, the ocean becomes aerodynamically very rough, with the value of the surface roughness approaching that of Exposure C. Based on this analysis, it is recommended that the use of Exposure D along the hurricane coastline in ASCE 7 be discontinued.
