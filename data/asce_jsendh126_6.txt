AB - This is the first of two papers addressing the efficient approach of the torsional behavior of concrete elements through smeared crack analysis. This paper presents the development of an analytical model for the behavior of concrete elements in increasing torsion. The model is based on a special numerical technique that employs constitutive relations expressed in terms of normal stress and crack width, for the behavior of the crack process zones. The width of a crack process zone is considered as a material property and is estimated through comparisons between analytical and experimental data. The method is not restricted by the cross section shape because the analysis includes numerical mapping. Examination of the objectivity of the proposed analysis in relation to the used mesh density is included in the study. The proposed approach is also applicable to concrete elements subjected to torsion combined with flexure, shear, and axial force. Validation of the analytical model derived in this paper is demonstrated in a companion paper using extensive comparisons between predicted and experimentally obtained behavior curves and ultimate torque values.

AB - This is the second of two papers concerned with the development and the application of a smeared crack model for the description of the behavior of concrete elements in torsion. The first paper presented the development of an efficient model for the torsional analysis of concrete that utilizes a special numerical technique, which is properly adapted to include the smeared crack approach. This paper presents the validation of the analytical model by providing comparisons between analytically predicted behavior curves and experimentally obtained ones. The experimental data used in this paper comprise a series of tests in pure torsion conducted for this purpose and a database of experimental information compiled from works around the world, in an attempt to establish the validity of the proposed approach based on a broad range of parametric studies. From the comparisons between the predicted and the measured data, it is concluded that the proposed approach describes very well the behavior of concrete elements in pure torsion and yields satisfactory results for the case of nonrectangular elements subjected to combined torsion with flexure, shear, and axial force.

AB - This paper presents a new reinforced concrete beam finite element that explicitly accounts for the slip between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding concrete. The element formulation combines the fiber-section model with the finite-element model of a reinforcing bar with continuous slip. The section model retains the plane-section assumption, but the steel fiber strains are computed as the sum of two contributions, the rebar deformation and the anchorage slip. The model applies to any cross-sectional shape under biaxial bending and both monotonic and cyclic loads. The model theoretical framework is presented first. A sensitivity study on the monotonic and cyclic response of a reinforcing bar shows how the model traces the bar's reduced initial stiffness, bond degradation, and anchorage loss for insufficient anchorage length. Finally, comparison with an experimental test on a circular column shows that the prediction with the new model is in good agreement with the test, whereas the original fiber model with perfect bond overestimates the hysteretic energy dissipated during the loading cycles.

AB - This paper presents an advanced nonlinear finite-element (FE) program developed for the analysis of general composite structures of steel and reinforced concrete, including composite space trusses. The elements used to represent the concrete slab and steel beam actions are described, and in particular the ability to model ribbed composite slabs of reinforced concrete on profiled steel sheeting is demonstrated. Attention is drawn to the usefulness of the layering technique in determining local stress redistributions associated with progressive through-depth cracking and yielding in the slab and steel beam elements. Concrete is represented as a nonlinear elastic isotropic material before cracking and nonlinear orthotropic thereafter, while steel is taken to be initially elastic with strain-hardening capabilities after yielding. All material models are empirical in origin. A specialized stub element with empirical nonlinear shear force-slip relationships is used at the concrete slab–steel beam interface to permit modeling of either full or partial shear connector action. Results obtained from the use of the program, including predicted crack patterns, are shown to compare very well with those from experiments on reinforced concrete slabs and steel-concrete composite structures up to failure.

AB - Current practice for structural design of environmental concrete structures such as water reservoirs and sewage treatment tanks follows one of two philosophies. The tanks are either fully prestressed or non-prestressed. In one case, the design philosophy is to prevent cracks by keeping the concrete in compression. In the other case, the design philosophy is to allow cracks but limit steel stresses to ensure that the cracks do not become too wide. This paper presents the results of the experimental phase of a research program that aims to investigate the concept of partial prestressing in liquid containment structures. Understanding the behavior of partially prestressed tanks is the key for providing rational solutions ranging from reinforced concrete at one end of the design spectrum to fully prestressed concrete at the other. In the experimental phase, a total of eight full-scale specimens, representing segments from typical tank walls, were subjected to load and leakage tests. The test specimens covered a range of prestressed and non-prestressed reinforcement ratios and were subjected to various combinations of axial tension and bending. Partially prestressed specimens clearly showed improved crack width and distribution under both pure flexure and pure tensile loadings. While the specimens were under load, leakage tests were conducted to obtain leakage rates through the cracks. The flexural compression zone prevented leakage in all specimens tested under flexure. In addition, through-cracks demonstrated autosealing provided the crack widths were below a certain limit. These two aspects are important design parameters that are not explicitly recognized in current design standards.

AB - A significant percentage of the bridges in North America were built after the Second World War. Most of them were originally designed for smaller vehicles, lighter loads, and a lower traffic volume than commonly experienced today. A study reported by Klaiber et al. indicates that over 50% of all bridges in the United States were built before 1940, and approximately 42% of these bridges are considered to be structurally deficient. This alarming statistic underscores the importance of developing reliable and cost-effective repair and strengthening techniques for existing bridge structures. A particularly challenging problem in this area is the rehabilitation of reinforced concrete structures. In recent years, the repair of understrengthened or damaged reinforced concrete members by the external bonding of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates has received considerable attention. This paper investigates the flexural behavior of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with externally bonded FRP laminates. A simple and direct analytical procedure for evaluating the ultimate flexural capacity of FRP strengthened reinforced concrete flexural members is presented. The procedure is derived from equilibrium equations and compatibility of strains and is applicable to both singly and doubly reinforced concrete rectangular sections, as well as flanged sections. The procedure is validated by comparisons with results of experimental data available in the literature. Upper and lower limits of FRP that may be bonded to a reinforced concrete cross section to ensure ductile behavior are established, and design nomographs to facilitate implementation of the procedure are presented.

AB - Repair and strengthening of reinforced concrete beams is commonly carried out by “jacketing.” Jacketing is the addition of concrete and steel reinforcement (both longitudinal and transverse) to an existing beam. This paper describes an experimental investigation into the behavior of reinforced concrete beams strengthened by jacketing. Static and dynamic load tests to failure were carried out on 61 slant shear prisms and 13 jacketed reinforced concrete T-beams. The concrete used in the jacket was preplaced aggregate concrete. The strength of the bond between preplaced aggregate concrete and plain concrete was assessed by slant shear tests and a Mohr-Coulomb-type failure envelope was derived. Static failure of the beam specimens was related to this failure envelope. The beam experimental results demonstrated the importance of adequate reinforcement detailing (i.e., that full anchorage of the additional steel at simple supports and points of contraflexure and anchorage of the additional links at the top of the beam was necessary).

AB - A softened strut-and-tie model for determining interface shear capacity is proposed in this paper. Contrary to the shear-friction concept, the proposed theory predicts that ultimate failure is caused by the crushing of concrete in the compression struts formed after cracking of the concrete. The shear strength predictions of the proposed model and the empirical formulas of the ACI 318-95 building code are compared with collected experimental data from 147 specimens. Examination of existing experimental data indicated that the softened strut-and-tie model developed in this study is capable of predicting the interface shear strengths of both the push-off and the pull-off specimens with or without the precracked shear planes. The comparison shows that the performance of the softened strut-and-tie model is better than the ACI Code approach for the parameters under comparison. The parameters reviewed include concrete strength and amount of shear transfer reinforcement.

AB - An analytical model that incorporates time-dependent effects (creep and shrinkage) was developed to predict the long-term deflection of cracked reinforced concrete beams under sustained loading. The deflection model includes both bending and shear effects. Correspondingly, experimental studies were conducted to verify the analytical model. Eight specimens were precracked with a diagonal crack width of 0.2–0.3 mm and tested under sustained loading for three months. It was found that the contribution of shear effect to long-term deflection is significant. The predicted deflections including both bending and shear deformations agree very well with experimental measurements. In addition, formulas for calculating creep coefficients from strain increments were derived that provide an approach to calibrating the code specifications. The effects of different creep coefficients on the prediction of time-dependent deformations were discussed.

AB - The objectives of this paper are to present experimental data and analytical models to assist in the analysis and design of pegged joints in traditional timber frames. Seventy-two simplified mortise and tenon joints were loaded to failure under compression-induced double shear. Load, deformation, and time were recorded. All joints utilized 25.4-mm-diameter red oak pegs, typical of those used in modern timber-frame construction in North America. Half of the specimens were made with eastern white pine lumber, with the remaining specimens made of sugar maple. All specimens had 50.8 mm center pieces simulating a typical tenon. Side pieces were evenly divided into 25.4 mm and 50.8 mm thicknesses. Half of the specimens were arranged such that the center piece was loaded parallel to the grain and the side pieces perpendicular. Grain orientation was reversed for the remaining specimens. Joint stiffness was estimated by a regression analysis of the linear portion of the load-slip curves. A model for joint stiffness was developed for use in analysis of traditional timber frames. The stiffness model was found to underestimate the stiffness of typical pegged knee-brace joints by 20–30%. The yield theory was augmented with two peg deformation modes to develop a method for predicting failure loads. Strength predictions ranged from 16% low to 2% high in comparison with the test data.

AB - First- and second-order reliability methods are generally considered to be among the most useful for computing structural reliability. In these methods, the uncertainties included in resistances and loads are generally expressed as continuous random variables that have a known cumulative distribution function. The Rosenblatt transformation is a fundamental requirement for structural reliability analysis. However, in practical applications, the cumulative distribution functions of some random variables are unknown, and the probabilistic characteristics of these variables may be expressed using only statistical moments. In the present study, a structural reliability analysis method with inclusion of random variables with unknown cumulative distribution functions is suggested. Normal transformation methods that make use of high-order moments are investigated, and an accurate third-moment standardization function is proposed. Using the proposed method, the normal transformation for random variables with unknown cumulative distribution functions can be realized without using the Rosenblatt transformation. Through the numerical examples presented, the proposed method is found to be sufficiently accurate to include the random variables with unknown cumulative distribution functions in the first- and second-order reliability analyses with little extra computational effort.

AB - The conceptual phase of structural design involves selecting preliminary materials, selecting the overall structural form of the building, producing a rough dimensional layout, and considering technological possibilities. Decisions are made on the basis of such information as height of the building, building use, typical live load, wind velocity, earthquake loading, design fundamental period, design acceleration, maximum lateral deflection, spans, story height, and other client requirements. More detailed information about the task itself, constraints, possible solution principles, and known solutions for similar problems is extremely useful in the process of defining and finding a solution to the design problem. This paper presents the M-RAM, which is intended to assist engineers in the conceptual phase of the structural design of tall buildings by providing designers with adapted past design solutions generated by a distributed multi-reasoning mechanism. The objective of the M-RAM (Multi-Reasoning Model) is to provide the adapted past design solutions in an organized and reliable way, creating a support system to enhance creativity, engineering knowledge, and experience of designers. To test the feasibility of the proposed model, a prototype of a distributed artificial intelligence system was developed in which the Internet was used as a communication backbone for the different systems that implemented the reasoning mechanisms.
