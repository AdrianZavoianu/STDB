AB - The fundamental element of any structural steel shape is the flat plate. Damage to bridge structures consists of these plate elements, in combination, bent about their strong and/or weak axes. The purpose of this paper is to describe experimental and analytical research on heat straightening as applied to plates and to present related engineering criteria for its use. An experimental program was conducted to evaluate the response of plates to heat straightening and to identify important parameters influencing behavior. Over 300 heats were applied to a variety of plates. The primary factors influencing straightening were the angle of the vee heat, steel temperature during heating, and external restraining forces. The plastic rotation after heating was directly proportional to these parameters. To aid engineers in predicting plate movements during heat straightening, a simple mathematical formula was developed. This equation relates the average plastic rotation per vee heat to vee angle, steel temperature, magnitude of restraining force, coefficient of thermal expansion, and yield stress. The formula compares well to the experimental data and is the first simple formula available that includes the parameters of heating temperature and magnitude of restraining force. The form of this analytical approach also will lend itself toward extensions, including the behavior of rolled shapes, axially loaded members, and composite and noncomposite girders.

AB - The process of heat straightening damaged rolled shapes is based on a logical extension of the straightening of plates. When damaged, some plate elements are bent about their strong axis, some about their weak axis, and some about both. The overall effect on a rolled shape is damage that is a combination of one or more of the following fundamental damage categories: (1) Category S denotes primary bending about the major or strong axis; (2) Category W denotes primary bending about the minor or weak axis; (3) Category T denotes torsion or twisting of a member about its longitudinal axis; and (4) Category L denotes localized damage to plate elements in the form of bulges, buckles, and crimps. The purpose of this paper is to examine the behavior of rolled shapes during heat straightening with the focus on Category S and Category W types of damage. For repair of such damage, simple heating patterns are used in combination. The use of vee, line, and strip heats are illustrated for both Category S and Category W damage. Over 300 heats were applied to 30 rolled shapes to document the behavior of heat-straightened angles, channels, and wide flange beams. The experimental data suggested that the amount of straightening during one heating cycle is a function of vee angle, magnitude of jacking force, shape of the cross section, and stress distribution due to jacking. A mathematical formula to predict the amount of straightening per heat was developed. The form of this formula was to modify the formula for a single plate element by including a load factor, shape factor, and stress factor. This approach produced reasonable agreement with the experimental data.

AB - The load-deformation behavior of a reinforced composite slab is required to determine the moment-rotation behavior of a composite partially restrained connection. A component model that can be used to predict this load-deformation behavior is developed in this paper. The model is validated by comparing it to the results of four full-scale experimental tests that were designed to isolate the load-deformation behavior of the composite slab. Behavior models for reinforcing steel, concrete tension stiffening, and shear studs are presented or developed to provide the necessary tools to predict the composite slab load-deformation behavior.

AB - An I-beam curved in plan and subjected to vertical loading experiences primary bending and nonuniform torsion actions. Because of this, the vertical deflections are coupled with twist rotations. These primary actions and deformations couple together to produce second-order bending actions about the minor axis. The interactions between these actions can grow rapidly, produce early nonlinear behavior and yielding, and lead to significant reductions of the ultimate load-carrying capacities. This paper develops a curved beam finite-element model for the geometric and material nonlinear analysis of I-beams curved in plan. Comparisons with existing results show that the finite-element model is accurate, effective, and economical. The numerical results show that when the initial curvature of a curved beam is small, bending is the major action and the nonlinear inelastic behavior is similar to the inelastic flexural-torsional buckling of a straight beam. However, if this initial curvature is not small, both nonuniform torsion and bending are dominant and nonlinear inelastic behavior develops very early. The behavior differs markedly from the inelastic flexural-torsional buckling behavior of a straight beam.

AB - Local and global instabilities are usually treated as separate phenomena in the design of steel beams in buildings. In the past, such a notional decoupling of these local and global manifestations was necessary in the interest of creating useful and practical design provisions for steel specifications. Currently, great emphasis is being placed on ensuring ductile and predictable member level behavior in the interest of guaranteeing adequate systemwide response. The current practice of decoupling localized and global instabilities when determining member response is inadequate if structural ductility is to be correctly predicted. The research outlined herein uses experimentally verified nonlinear finite-element modeling techniques to identify two distinct inelastic modal manifestations that occur in compact I-shaped beams at failure. The existence of the two modes is supported by experimental evidence obtained from the literature, as well as other corroborating finite-element studies in the literature. A bifurcation point in the equilibrium path of I-shaped beams, at a load level close to the plastic capacity of the cross section, appears to mark the transition point between the so-called Mode 1 and Mode 2 inelastic buckling manifestations. Simple geometric parameters such as flange slenderness, web slenderness, and unbraced length, among others, are incapable alone of predicting the transition from one mode to another. In addition, predictive techniques contained in the literature and aimed at quantifying steel I-beam rotation capacity are not applicable to a wide enough range of beam geometries so as to be useful in design practice. Similarly, these techniques do not consider the important influences of certain features in the steel constitutive response for a particular steel grade. In order for a robust method to be identified as useful in predicting steel I-beam ductility, it is believed that one must consider cross-sectional geometry, unbraced length, and certain important material parameters such as yield strength, yield ratio, whether or not a yield plateau is present, and strain-hardening modulus.

AB - An investigation of the ultimate strength of tubular joints has been carried out in order to develop an analytical method that provides a rational basis for the design of tubular joints. In this paper, the ultimate strength of the axially loaded X-joints was evaluated using the yield line method. Two theoretical models based on the observed failure mechanism were presented. In the first model, it was considered that the ultimate strength is determined by the plastic moment capacity on the yield lines and the membrane action in the yield zone of the chord surface. The second model, which takes membrane action in the saddle region into account, was developed to predict the strength of X-joints when the ratio of brace to chord diameter approaches 1.0. The proposed theoretical models were successfully verified by comparing with the empirical formulas and the experimental results of 128 joint tests reported in the literature.

AB - Using a previously presented finite-element study of axially loaded overlap tubular K-joints as a platform, this paper presents further work that aimed at extending and enhancing the strength estimation equation already presented. The current work includes extending the θ (brace angle) validity range to 30° ≤ θ ≤ 60°; investigating the effects of the yield stress/ultimate tensile strength ratio and the brace/chord yield stress ratio; exploring the influence of loading reversal; and quantifying the reduction in strength caused by the absence of the hidden weld. The end result of these studies is a new, extended capacity equation. The accuracy of the proposed equation to predict the axial capacity of test joints was established by assessing it using an experimental database. The applicability of the proposed equation for design practice was further ascertained by investigating strength sensitivities to material curve variations, different chord end support conditions, and joints with unequal brace inclinations. The proposed design equation is found to be both accurate and conservative and is therefore recommended to be used in practice.

AB - The use of internal ring stiffeners in offshore steel jacket platforms is a subject of controversy because of their peculiar failure pattern, observed in several tests in the early 1980s. It is estimated that at least 2,000 internally ring-stiffened steel tubular joints are in service in the North Sea. Despite the fact that internal ring stiffeners have been introduced in many offshore platforms, none of the design codes provide quantitative design guidance. Therefore, to create an extensive database on internally ring-stiffened steel tubular joints, experimental investigations were conducted at the Structural Engineering Research Centre, in Chennai, India, on the fatigue behavior of internally ring-stiffened steel tubular joints. Various loading conditions, joint geometries, and environments were considered. In this paper, the experimental results are compared with API and DEn design curves and the results are discussed.

AB - The increase in the use of rectangular hollow sections in mainstream steel structures coupled with the economics of prefabrication have highlighted the need for design methods that produce economical bolted tubular connections. The development of a design model for a particular connection type normally follows the determination of the connection behavior using experimental or numerical methods. This paper describes the finite-element modeling philosophy employed to analyze bolted moment end-plate connections joining square and rectangular hollow sections that are subjected to pure bending. The ABAQUS finite-element package is used to simulate the experimental behavior observed in tests performed at the University of Sydney. The parameters varied in both the experiments and ABAQUS simulations include the end-plate thickness, the section shape (square or rectangular), and the position of the bolts. The results obtained from the finite-element analyses are evaluated and the effectiveness of the model assessed by comparing the numerically predicted ultimate loads and moment-rotation responses with those of the corresponding tests.

AB - This paper presents a performance-based optimization method for optimal topology design of bracing systems for multistory steel building frameworks with overall stiffness constraint under multiple lateral loading conditions. Material removal criteria are derived by undertaking a sensitivity analysis on the mean compliance of a structure with respect to element removal. A performance index is proposed to evaluate the performance of resulting bracing systems in the optimization process. In the proposed method, unbraced frameworks are initially designed under strength constraints using commercial standard steel sections from databases. The optimal topology of a bracing system for the multistory steel building framework is then generated by gradually removing inefficient materials from a continuum design domain that is used to stiffen the framework until the performance of the bracing system is maximized. Two design examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the performance-based design optimization method proposed for the conceptual layout design of lateral bracing systems for multistory steel building frameworks.

AB - In recent years, increasing interest has been shown throughout Europe in developing and designing slim floor systems in steel-framed buildings. This paper presents the fire resistance behavior of the composite asymmetric slim floor beam as an isolated member and as a part of the frame using numerical analysis methods. Three schemes were investigated, including isolated beams, a plane subframe with semirigid beam-to-column connections, and a 3D slim floor frame system. The first scheme aimed to explore the fire resistance of the beams according to standard fire-testing methodology. The objective of the second scheme was to reveal the effect of frame continuity on the fire resistance of the slim floor beam and the mechanical interaction between the frame elements. The third scheme was to preliminarily identify the influence of the composite slab on the beam behavior in fire. The investigations show that the isolated slim floor beam has a 60-min standard fire resistance without any additional fire protection, if the load ratio is &lt;0.5. As a part of the frame, the beam still keeps its stability even when the temperature of the bottom steel flange of the beam reaches up to 900°C (90-min ISO fire exposure). The analyzed results indicate that the axial restraints provided by the surrounding parts cause a larger deformation of the beam in the earlier ISO heating phase and a more stable behavior thereafter. The rotational restraints essentially cause the change in the applied load ratio in fire, which can be quantified using the “modified load ratio” proposed in this paper.

AB - Stability of a newly proposed structural system, namely, the prebuckled or prestressed dome with ring stiffener, is investigated. The prestressed dome is different from traditional domes in that it is made by first elastically buckling shallow, straight radial members and then attaching them to their supports. A special-purpose algorithm devised to consider a staged construction method of the system using nonlinear finite-element models is implemented into the program named DOME3D. Stability of the prestressed dome with two different rise-to-span ratios is studied with a varying number of ring stiffeners. The study shows that the stiffened system is not vulnerable to loading imperfections leading to side-sway buckling. The stiffening methods increased the limit load by more than 100% and changed the buckling mode of the system. For some stiffener configurations, the behavior of the stiffened domes was similar to shell-like domes. The results showed that the stiffening system leads to significant increase in the strength-to-weight ratio of the novel type structure, and improvement in the overall stability behavior of the dome.

AB - This paper presents an approximate solution for the stresses in an inclined planar silo. The solution may be applied to the design of inclined rectangular silos with a large aspect ratio and to the design of mining tunnels. It is based on the assumptions that the stored cohesionless solid is at failure and is fully mobilized against the walls. The pattern of stress distribution across the silo width is assumed to be independent of vertical positions and is derived making use of conditions at a great length. The effects of silo geometrical properties and the properties of the stored solid on the stresses are investigated. The present predictions also show a reasonably close agreement with limited experimental observations available in the literature.
