AB - Steel moment frames are used for seismic design in the United States and Japan and are highly regarded structural systems, but severe damage to steel frames occurred during the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquakes. Examination of similarities and differences in the engineering research and practice for these frames in the two countries provides insight into this important seismic issue. A brief history of the engineering practice in both countries is provided, and current practice and design methods are summarized and compared. The evolution of structural systems and the details and practices employed in the two countries are described. Damage from past earthquakes is briefly reviewed. Welding processes and material behavior are also compared, because they influence the seismic behavior of these systems. Many U.S. engineers believe that Japanese buildings are much stiffer and stronger but less ductile than comparable U.S. buildings. It will be shown that this is not always the case. Significant differences in U.S. and Japanese design practices will be shown, but even greater similarities in our structures and design procedures will be noted. As a consequence, this paper should help engineers from both countries learn from one another.

AB - Through the use of moment-curvature analysis of circular bridge columns, dimensionless serviceability and damage control curvature relationships are developed that depend only on the column axial load ratio and section diameter. These relationships are used to establish curvature, displacement ductility, drift ratio, and equivalent viscous damping capacities for the design limit states considered. It is shown that current code-based design approaches, which imply a constant ductility factor, will generally result in damage levels that are highly variable. The paper also discusses implications of the study on limit-states design approaches such as displacement-based design.

AB - Unilateral, bilateral, and triaxial shaking table tests are conducted to study the seismic response of a three-story base-isolated steel structure. The lateral force distribution formulas specified in the Uniform Building Code are evaluated experimentally. A method to calculate the lateral force distribution is proposed and experimentally verified. Seismic responses of the test model to the unilateral, bilateral, and triaxial ground excitations are compared. The effects of vertical ground acceleration on the maximum acceleration of the superstructure and the maximum displacement of the isolation system are investigated. The maximum displacements of the isolation system under bilateral and triaxial ground motions are compared with those determined from the “1.0 + 0.3” direction combination rule. In addition to the plan-symmetric condition, both one-way and two-way eccentricities are introduced into the isolation system. The increase of the peak story acceleration may be significant, compared with those obtained from unilateral and bilateral ground shakings. The experimental results from the plan-eccentric condition also are compared with the conclusions of other analytical studies.

AB - Passive energy dissipation devices are used to reduce the damage from earthquakes by absorbing a portion of the earthquake-induced energy in structures. Wide acceptance of these devices in structures will depend on the availability of simplified methods for their analysis and design. The objectives of this study are to (1) investigate the effect of increased viscous damping on the seismic response of structures; (2) assess the accuracy of the linear static and linear dynamic procedures recommended in the NEHRP Guidelines for the Seismic Rehabilitation of Buildings (FEMA 273) for design of structures with velocity-dependent passive energy dissipation devices; and (3) propose modifications to the current design procedures to improve their accuracy. Based on the analysis of single-degree-of-freedom structures subjected to a large number of earthquake records, the study identifies the following limitations of the FEMA 273 procedures: (1) The use of a constant reduction factor for the displacement response of short-period structures; and (2) the assumption of a harmonic response to compute the peak velocity as well as the story and base shears. In many cases, these assumptions result in nonconservative estimates of the peak response and base shear. Comparisons of the results using the methods proposed in this study and in FEMA 273 with time-history analyses for several single- and multi-degree-of-freedom structures indicate that the proposed procedures give more accurate results.

AB - A new design and retrofit concept that deals with the placement and functional attributes of dampers for the seismic protection of buildings is presented. The configuration for the proposed concept is referred to as load balancing prestressed tendon-fuse + damper system. The system is based on the notion of prestressed load-balancing and uses a combination of tendons, fuse-bars, and dampers; the latter preferably possessing recentering and preload characteristics. It is shown that the system has a direct effect in reducing the overturning moment demand on the main structural elements. The new approach is first contrasted with the concept that is currently used by designers and advocated in FEMA 273. Next, an overall strategy is presented for the various phases of the design process. This includes the facets of conceptual and preliminary design as well as the final design verification process. The efficacy of the preliminary design phase is improved by a well-conceived single-degree-of-freedom idealization of the structural system. The general normalized design parameters for the supplemental system are then transformed for the multi-degree-of-freedom system based on specific configuration details. Finally, the seismic design and evaluation of a nine-story steel building is presented as an example of the applicability of the proposed design algorithm and system configuration.

AB - Tuned liquid column dampers (TLCDs) are a class of tuned liquid dampers that impart indirect damping to the primary structure through oscillations of the liquid column in a U-shaped container. The energy dissipation in the water column results from the passage of the liquid through an orifice with inherent head-loss characteristics. The overall damping in a TLCD depends on the head-loss coefficient and the velocity of the oscillating liquid, and it is nonlinear due to the quadratic damping term. Using the TLCD theory and the equivalent linearization scheme, a new approach has been developed that helps to compute the optimum head-loss coefficient for a given level of wind or seismic excitation in a single step, without resorting to iterations. The optimal damping coefficient and tuning ratio of a TLCD using a single degree of freedom system under the white noise and a set of filtered white noise excitations representing wind and seismic loadings is presented. Optimum values of damping have also been investigated for multiple TLCDs. An example is presented to demonstrate the performance of multiple TLCDs in controlling multiple modes under wind excitation.

AB - This paper describes a beam-column element intended to model steel members with flexural yielding, as well as members with yielding under combined flexure and axial force in frames subject to earthquake ground motions. The element has the capability to model plastic axial deformation and changes in axial stiffness, and it employs hardening rules to handle monotonic, cyclic, or arbitrary loading. When compared with experimental results and fiber model predictions, the element shows significantly better performance than typical bilinear hinge models. The developed element can more accurately predict local deformation demands and the overall response of structural systems under earthquake loading than the bilinear hinge element.

AB - A series of dynamic experiments for 20 models of high arch dams were recently performed on a shaking table, with the water ignored. The experimental results show that the seismic response and final failure of high arch dams are significantly affected by the contraction joints depending upon the contact materials, the motion of the surfaces, and other factors. The instantaneous acceleration that occurs when the first tensile crack appears is employed very tentatively as the parameter to quantitatively estimate the overload capacity of high arch dams from small-scale models. The final failure patterns of the model dams also are reported and discussed. From the results of the experimental investigation, a new idea is suggested, which is to use the contraction joints to control the response of a high arch dam and thereby to control the level of the seismic damage.

AB - Along-wind, crosswind, and torsional vibrations of structures are different aspects of the same physical phenomenon. Despite this fact, each aspect has been the object of numerous studies involving lines of research that have frequently been independent of each other. These independent lines of research have often been characterized by notable inconsistencies and clashes. This paper proposes a single coherent formulation that provides compact expressions for estimating the along-wind, crosswind, and torsional response based on a generalized gust factor approach. It presents the wind-loading model and uses a generalized equivalent spectrum technique to derive closed-form solutions of the 3D wind-excited response of slender structures and structural elements. This extends a solution previously obtained for along-wind vibrations to the crosswind and torsional response. Numerical examples are provided that illustrate the simplicity and precision of this method. Because of this simplicity and precision, the method is suitable for use in design offices as a means of providing rapid estimates of the dynamic response of slender structures to gust buffeting actions. In particular, the estimates of the crosswind and torsional response will allow the designers to make more informed decisions on when to conduct physical model studies in boundary-layer wind tunnels.

AB - A comprehensive experimental study of local wind pressure fluctuations on low building roofs has been carried out, by testing a variety of building models exposed to open and suburban boundary-layer flows for various wind directions, to determine the overall stochastic characteristics of wind loads on roofs. The analysis of pressure data indicates that the pressure fluctuations are sensitive to tap location, roof geometry, and wind direction. Both Gaussian and non-Gaussian fluctuations have been found in all roof types; however, non-Gaussian fluctuations are generally found in flow separation zones. Zones of Gaussian and non-Gaussian pressure fluctuations are presented. Relevant stochastic characteristics of wind pressure fluctuations in time, frequency, and amplitude domains are discussed.

AB - Though many methods of system identification are currently available for parameter estimation of structural systems, the challenge lies in the numerical difficulty in convergence when the number of unknowns is large. In this study, the genetic algorithms (GA) approach is adopted, which has several advantages over classical system identification techniques. Nevertheless, if applied directly, this approach requires tremendous computational time when dealing with structural systems large in both unknowns and degrees of freedom. A method is proposed herein to alleviate this problem by conducting a GA search in modal domains of a much smaller dimension than the physical domain. The objective function is defined based on the estimated modal response in time domain and the corresponding modal response transformed from the measured response. With some modification, this method also works well even with incomplete response measurement. Numerical examples of structural systems of up to 50 degrees of freedom are presented. Effects of measurement noise are considered.

AB - This paper is aimed at investigating the ultimate strength and ductility capacity correlation between centrally loaded and eccentrically loaded steel columns subjected to cyclic transverse (horizontal) load at their top. The columns considered are of the box and pipe sections. A finite-element formulation accounting for both geometrical and material nonlinearity is developed to obtain the cyclic hysteretic behavior of the columns. In the analysis, a modified two-surface plasticity model is employed to model material nonlinearity. Based on the numerical results, the transverse load versus transverse displacement relationship between centrally and eccentrically loaded columns has been proposed. According to the proposed equations, the ultimate strength and ductility capacity of the eccentrically loaded columns can be conveniently obtained from those of the centrally loaded columns.

AB - This paper is aimed at evaluating the ultimate strength and ductility capacity of steel pipe section columns subjected to cyclic out-of-plane transverse loading as well as the constant in-plane eccentric vertical load. A finite-element formulation accounting for both geometrical and material nonlinearity is developed to obtain the inelastic behavior of the columns. In the analysis, a modified two-surface plasticity model is employed to predict the cyclic characteristics of steel. An extensive parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effect of radius-thickness ratio, column slenderness ratio, and eccentric distance on the strength and ductility of the columns. It is found that the ultimate strength and ductility formulas proposed by the writers for the centrally loaded columns are also applicable to those of the eccentrically loaded columns subjected to cyclic out-of-plane loading, as long as a modification coefficient of initial structural stiffness is employed to multiply the computed results.

AB - This paper presents an analysis of the triply coupled vibration of asymmetric wall-frame structure in tall buildings. The governing equation of the natural vibration and its corresponding eigenvalue problem, which is a set of equations for flexural-shear vibrations in laterally orthogonal directions coupled with a warping St. Venant torsional vibration, are developed. By applying the Galerkin method, a generalized approximate approach is developed for the analysis of coupled vibration and for determining the natural frequencies and associated mode shapes of the structure in triply coupled vibration. The results of the proposed method for the example structure show good agreement with those of the FEM analysis. The proposed method has been shown to provide a simple and efficient, yet accurate, means of coupled vibration analysis of asymmetric tall building structures.

AB - The loads on buildings and structures caused by the buffeting action of wind have traditionally been analyzed using the gust loading factor (GLF) approach in most codes and standards. In this approach, the equivalent static wind loading used in design is equal to the mean wind force multiplied by the GLF. Although the traditional GLF method can ensure an accurate estimation of the displacement response, it may not provide a reliable estimate of other response components. In addition, this method fails to provide any guidance in cases with a zero mean response. This note presents a theoretical formulation for the buffeting wind loading on structures, which eliminates these shortcomings. A tall building and a long-span bridge are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and improved predictive features of the proposed formulation.
