AB - The design of tall reinforced concrete buildings must satisfy serviceability criteria for lateral drift. It is therefore important to accurately assess the lateral deflection of a structure to account for the nonlinear effect of cracking in concrete. Iterative procedures are necessary for this serviceability analysis of tall reinforced concrete buildings, because the concrete members that contribute to lateral stiffness have varying degrees of cracking. Two procedures for the determination of lateral drift in reinforced concrete structures are presented in this paper. These procedures have been verified from the experimental data of tests on full-size structural subassemblages. Both procedures initially consider all the concrete members to be uncracked. An initial analysis then determines the cracked members and their stiffnesses are modified using probability-based effective stiffness relationships. The redistribution of force and subsequent modifications of the member stiffnesses are applied iteratively until convergence of the structural response is obtained. These procedures are computationally more efficient and direct than the general nonlinear finite-element method and are compatible with linear elastic analysis software that is commonly available in most structural engineering design offices.

AB - Tests on half-scale and plast brick masonry specimens subjected to cyclic biaxial compression were conducted for five principal stress ratios. An interaction curve for the principal stresses at failure was obtained experimentally and expressed mathematically in terms of stress invariants. The failure under biaxial compression was characterized by midthickness splitting of the bearing area. The failure was quantified by the critical orthogonal strain that governed the failure, which in turn defines the critical stress-strain envelope curves. The critical envelope curve and the corresponding common point and stability point curves were expressed in mathematical form by general exponential formulas. The stability point curves can be used to establish the permissible stress level under in-plane cyclic loading.

AB - A model for the numerical analysis of masonry subjected to out-of-plane loading is proposed. The proposed composite plasticity model is able to reproduce elastic and inelastic behavior in two orthogonal directions coinciding with the orientation of the bed and head joints of masonry. The implementation of the model is described, and a comparison with experimental data on masonry strength is provided. Good agreement is found for different masonry types. Further validation of the model with experimental results on masonry panels subjected to out-of-plane loading demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed approach and the possibilities offered by numerical analysis for the understanding of the complex nonlinear phenomena involved in the failure of masonry plates and shells. In particular, this paper addresses issues such as the adequacy of yield-line analysis for the design of masonry structures subjected to out-of-plane loading, the influence of the aspect ratio of the panels, and the influence of in-plane normal pressure.

AB - Four concrete block masonry and two reinforced concrete walls were designed to simulate low-rise nonductile walls built decades ago, before the enactment of earthquake-resistant design provisions. Two masonry walls were unreinforced and two were partially reinforced. The concrete walls had minimum reinforcement. One wall from each pair was retrofitted using a steel strip system consisting of diagonal and vertical strips that were attached using through-thickness bolts. Stiff steel angles and anchor bolts were used to connect the steel strips to the foundation and the top loading beam. All walls were tested under combined constant gravity load and incrementally increasing in-plane lateral deformation reversals. The lightly reinforced concrete walls were also repaired using only vertical strips and retested. These tests showed that the complete steel-strip system was effective in significantly increasing the in-plane strength and ductility of low-rise unreinforced and partially reinforced masonry walls, and lightly reinforced concrete walls.

An equilibrium diagram is also presented to calculate the ultimate strength of walls based on a lower bound theorem of plasticity. Step-by-step analyses were conducted to establish force-displacement relationships of walls that compared well with those obtained experimentally. A simple retrofit design procedure is formulated and illustrated using a numerical example.

AB - The prestressing technique using external tendons can be considered an effective method of strengthening bridges deteriorating due to increasing overloading and progressive structural aging. In order to analytically investigate the dynamic behavior of prestressed composite girder bridges, strengthened with external tendons, this paper focuses on a simply supported prestressed composite girder with alternative prestressing levels, eccentricity of the attached tendons, and tendons properties. The accuracy of the proposed analysis is verified by comparison with the results of dynamic tests on large-scale prestressed composite girders. Furthermore, as a practical example, the results of a dynamic test in which the strengthening method is applied to an actual bridge are discussed.

AB - A mechanism analysis of shear failure of simply supported reinforced concrete deep beams is presented. Concrete and steel reinforcement are modeled as rigid perfectly plastic materials. The failure modes are idealized as an assemblage of rigid blocks separated by failure zones of displacement discontinuity. The shear strength of deep beams is derived as a function of the location of the instantaneous center of relative rotation of moving blocks. Minimization of the developed function gives the shear capacity of deep beams. Comparisons of the predicted shear capacity of numerous deep beams show good agreement with results obtained from experiments. A parametric study of main variables affecting shear strength of deep beams is conducted. The present model shows that the shear-span-to-depth ratio has more influence on the shear capacity than the span-to-depth ratio and as the former increases, the shear strength decreases. Increasing main longitudinal bottom reinforcement increases the shear capacity up to a certain limit beyond which no shear strength improvement could be achieved. The relative effectiveness of horizontal and vertical web reinforcement on the load capacity is mainly influenced by the shear-span-to-depth ratio; the deeper the beam, the more effective the horizontal web reinforcement and the less effective the vertical web reinforcement.

AB - The increasing number of roller compacted concrete (RCC) dams being built around the world demands accurate methodologies for the realistic short- and long-term evaluations of the risk of thermally induced cracking in these constructions. In this work a numerical procedure for the simulation of the construction process of RCC dams is presented. It takes into account the more relevant features of the behavior of concrete at early ages, such as hydration, aging, creep, and damage. A 2D model of the Urugua-í RCC Dam, built in Argentina, is used to perform the corresponding analyses. In this first part only the thermochemical aspects of the simulation of the construction process are presented. The temperature distribution and evolution inside the dam are obtained before and after the completion of the dam. The evolution of the compressive and tensile strengths and elastic moduli and their final distribution inside the dam can also be predicted. Results from 2D and simplified vertical 1D models are compared to assess the validity of the latter, and several parametric studies are carried out. The simulation and discussion of the mechanical aspects of the construction process are relegated to a companion paper that follows.

A 2D model of the Urugua-;aaı RCC Dam, built in Argentina, is used to perform the corresponding analyses. In this second part of the paper, the mechanical aspects of the simulation are presented; long-term effects are included by incorporating a creep model that naturally accounts for the aging effects, and the risk of tensile damage is also considered. The methodology determines the stress field inside the dam at any time during the construction and in the following years. Results for the reference case assess the suitability of the adopted design. This is compared to alternative studies considering different construction schedules to conclude that for these cases changes should be introduced in the dam design.

AB - A conceptual model is presented for describing the behavior of cracked reinforced concrete elements, representing a hybrid formulation between a fully rotating crack model and a fixed crack model. The formulation described builds on the concepts of the modified compression field theory, treating cracked concrete as an orthotropic material with unique stress-strain relationships in compression and tension. Advancements in the formulation, relative to the modified compression field theory, include a new approach to the reorientation of concrete stress and strain fields, removing the restriction that they be coincident, and an improved treatment of shear stresses on crack surfaces. New sets of equilibrium, compatibility, and constitutive relations are formulated accordingly, and alternative crack slip models are discussed. The proposed theory is shown to yield improved simulations of response in specific situations where the previous formulation was found to produce inaccuracies. This paper describes the formulation of the theory at the fundamental level.

AB - The issue of variability in the results of structural analysis in common practice is discussed. Discussion is confined to reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. The sources of variability are classified into geometric simplification, material modeling, level of sophistication of analysis, and human error. These are discussed using results from the literature and from illustrative examples. Emphasis is made on the need to incorporate uncertainty of structural analysis in the development of load factors. The LRFD approach is reviewed as it relates to this problem. Studies on human error in structural design are reviewed where correlation is observed between the level of knowledge of designers and reported structural failures. Recommendations given in this paper are motivated by the fact that the proliferation of computers and the availability of powerful software have impacted structural analysis methodology. This is noticeable in the engineering profession, codes of practice, and academia.

AB - Light-frame wood roof trusses often require lateral bracing to reduce the effective length of compression web members for buckling purposes. Three simple analysis methods were compared in a physical test program to determine if any could adequately predict required brace strength and stiffness. A test program measured brace force and lateral deflection at midheight of 774 nominal 2 × 4 (38 × 89 mm) lumber columns of two grades and four lengths loaded in axial compression and braced with a nonlinear support. Lumber length or grade had little practical effect on the relative accuracy of the three analysis methods. Brace instability, observed in 1% of the tests, suggests the need to limit brace loads. Using 2% of the axial load to predict brace force was generally conservative but may not be appropriate, because it does not ensure sufficient brace stiffness. Two other evaluated methods, modified to achieve design conservatism, can provide a rational basis for bracing design that considers both required strength and stiffness.

AB - The exact tangent and secant stiffness matrices of an initially curved beam-column element under predominant axial force and end moments are derived. The stability function of solving the differential equilibrium equation for the beam-column element is further extended to allow for the important effect of member initial imperfection. The accuracy of this developed element makes the convergence rate for equilibrium and resistance against divergence better than that by the conventional cubic element or other currently available elements. The use of a single element per member is adequate enough for the extreme case of a column with both ends fixed, in which even two cubic elements cannot generate an accurate result. As a single element can sufficiently model a member, the second-order analysis, the nonlinear integrated design and analysis, and the advanced analysis become simple, reliable, and easy to use for practical design. The present element can also be used as a benchmark element for second-order elastic analysis of 2D and 3D frames and represents the ultimate solution for the imperfect element under Timoshenko's beam-column theory.

The second example examines a structure-foundation interaction problem of a seven-story frame supported by a foundation beam on a two-parameter foundation model.
