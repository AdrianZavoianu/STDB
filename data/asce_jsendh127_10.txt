AB - The use of heat straightening to repair damaged steel is finding increasing applications. However, there is one area in which little information can be found: the repair of localized damage. Described in this paper is a methodology for heat straightening repair of typical localized damage such as bulges or buckles. The keys to a safe repair are to (1) select proper heating patterns; (2) limit the heating temperature to 650°C (1,200°F) for carbon steels; and (3) limit jacking forces so that jacking stresses do not exceed 50% of yield at ambient temperature. Shown in this paper are recommended heating patterns for typical types of localized damage as well as methods for determining jacking forces. Experimental tests were also conducted where induced damage was repaired using various heating patterns. The data provide the basis for developing the most effective heating patterns. The use of procedures recommended here will result in a repaired member with strength properties similar to that of the original undamaged member, but with reduction in ductility.

AB - The strength of thin-walled cylindrical shell structures is highly dependent on the nature and magnitude of imperfections. Most importantly, circumferential imperfections have been reported to have an especially detrimental effect on the buckling resistance of these shells under axial load. Due to the manufacturing techniques commonly used during the erection of steel silos and tanks, specific types of imperfections are introduced into these structures, among them circumferential weld-induced imperfections between strakes of steel plates. A study on several factors influencing the buckling of silos and tanks was carried out using the finite-element method. The interaction between neighboring circumferential weld imperfections was investigated, and it was found that the influence on the buckling behavior depended on the strake height in relation to the linear meridional bending half-wavelength and the depth of the imperfection. The shape of localized circumferential weld imperfections was found to influence the buckling behavior of silos and tanks. The influence of a recently developed shape function on the buckling behavior has been examined. The strengthening effect of weld-induced residual stress fields was also studied, and the extent of the increase in buckling strength was derived for a large range of cylinder geometries.

AB - A series of tests on cold-formed unlipped channels with comparatively stocky webs and subjected to web crippling is presented in this paper. The web slenderness values of the channels ranged from 15.3 to 45. The tests were conducted under the four loading conditions (End-One-Flange, Interior-One-Flange, End-Two-Flange, and Interior-Two-Flange) specified in the Australian/New Zealand and American specifications for cold-formed steel structures. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the specifications. It is demonstrated that the design strengths predicted by the specifications are generally unconservative for unlipped channels. Test strengths as low as 43% of the design strengths were obtained. Hence, new web crippling design equations for unlipped channels are proposed in this paper. The proposed design equations are derived based on a simple plastic mechanism model, and the web crippling strength is obtained by dispersing the bearing load through the web. It is shown that the web crippling strengths predicted by the proposed design equations are generally conservative for unlipped channels with web slenderness values of less than or equal to 45. It is concluded that the proposed design equations for unlipped channels having stocky webs are reliable.

AB - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fatigue strength of a particular welded diaphragm-to-beam connection. The connection consisted of wide flange diaphragm members welded directly to the web of a deeper main beam member. Cyclic tests were performed to determine the fatigue resistance of the detail and to evaluate three different repair methods. The repair methods investigated involved combinations of diaphragm removal, drilling holes at the beam crack tips, and peening the bottom flange weld toes. This study has shown that the web and bottom flange welds of nonstaggered diaphragms are more susceptible to fatigue cracking than comparable staggered diaphragm configurations. It was also found that the fatigue life of the detail is not greatly reduced because of the formation of web and bottom flange weld fatigue cracks, because cracks formed in the beam web at the end of the bottom flange diaphragm weld controlled the fatigue behavior. Moreover, the repair methods were found to be effective in significantly extending the cyclic life of the diaphragm detail.

AB - End plates and base plates are routinely used in cantilevered structures supporting traffic signs, signals, and lights. Despite this fact, a standard procedure for the design of these plates has never been established. In this paper, a new procedure is developed for the design of end plates and base plates of these structures, and for base plates of span-wire-mounted traffic-signal structures. The proposed procedure is based on beam-and-plate bending and torsion theories, and is intended for use when designing plates of square configurations. Plate thicknesses and stresses obtained using this procedure compared well with those estimated using finite-element analysis, and supported earlier conclusions reached through physical testing.

AB - This paper focused on investigating the moment resistance of steel I-beam to concrete-filled tube (CFT) column uniplanar connections under monotonic static loading. The composite connection can be stiffened or unstiffened. An empirical formula was derived based on &gt;100 numerical parametric analysis results. The key parameters were studied numerically by finite-element method and the relevant ones that affect moment resistance were captured in the proposed formula. To verify the empirical formula and understand clearly the static behavior of the composite connections, eight specimens were designed and tested to failure, of which four specimens were semirigid beam-to-column connections and others were rigid connections with different types of stiffening details. The comparison between the predictions and test results showed that the empirical formula could be used to predict the moment resistance. The proposed rebar stiffener was found to be very effective in improving the static behavior of the composite connections.

AB - This paper describes a test program on welded stainless steel X- and K-joints fabricated from square hollow section (SHS) brace members and chords. The X-joints were tested in compression and tension using different ratios of brace width to chord width. The K-joints were tested by varying the ratio of brace width to chord width, the angle between chord and brace members, and the preload applied to the chord. A total of 23 tests were performed. Design rules are proposed for X- and K-joints by adopting the rules of the Comité International pour le Developpement et l'Etude de la Construction Tubulaire (CIDECT) recommendations for carbon steel tubular structures and replacing the yield stress in these recommendations by a proof stress. It is shown that the 0.2% proof stress, as determined from the finished tube, can be used to determine the ultimate strength using the CIDECT design rules and that the serviceability limit state corresponding to joint deformations of 1% of the chord width will not be reached if the CIDECT strength rules are adopted. It is also shown that the CIDECT strength rules produce unconservative design strengths when using the 0.5% proof stress in cases of high compressive forces in the chord. However, the serviceability limit state will generally not be reached if the 0.5% proof stress is used.

AB - This paper describes a test program on welded stainless steel X- and K-joints fabricated from circular hollow section (CHS) brace members and chords. The X-joints were tested in compression and tension using three different ratios of brace diameter to chord diameter. The K-joints were tested using three different ratios of brace diameter to chord diameter and three different angles between chord and brace members. A total of 15 tests were performed. Design rules are proposed for X- and K-joints by adopting the rules of the Comité International pour le Developpement et l'Etude de la Construction Tubulaire (CIDECT) recommendations for carbon steel tubular structure and replacing the yield stress in these recommendations by a proof stress. It is shown that both the 0.2 and 0.5% proof stresses, as determined from the finished tube, can be used to determine the ultimate strength using the CIDECT strength rules. For K-joints, the serviceability limit state corresponding to joint deformations of 1% of the chord diameter will not be exceeded if the CIDECT strength rules are adopted. However, for less than full width X-joints, the deformations are likely to reach about 1.7 and 1.9% of the chord diameter if the design strength is based on the 0.2 and 0.5% proof stresses, respectively.

AB - This study investigates the shear strength of composite steel and concrete members in which the steel shape is fully encased in concrete. Two types of shear failure—diagonal shear and shear bond—are examined in this study. Through understanding of these failure modes, a new approach is proposed to predict the shear capacities of composite members. Major parameters investigated include steel flange width, shear reinforcement, concrete strength, and applied axial load. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach, a verification analysis is made by comparing shear capacities predicted by the proposed approach with previous test results. Furthermore, the shear capacities predicted by the proposed approach are also compared with those obtained by American and Japanese provisions. The results of the analysis and comparison indicate that the proposed approach yields satisfactory prediction of shear strength and provides a rational explanation on the mechanism of shear bond failure. A new term, the critical steel flange ratio, is introduced to distinguish the shear bond failure from the conventional diagonal shear failure.

AB - The flexural behavior of composite slabs made of slurry infiltrated mat concrete (SIMCON) deck and plain concrete topping was investigated. The SIMCON deck was fabricated to resemble a corrugated steel deck. Shear studs were used to prevent interfacial bond failure. Two steel fiber volumes were used in the SIMCON deck: 3.5 and 5.0%. The effect of rebar reinforcement of the concrete topping was also studied. Favorable results were achieved in this research effort. Encouraging strength and toughness test results for composite slabs using corrugated SIMCON deck were obtained, revealing potential for field applications of this proposed system.

AB - The Rankine method has been applied to steel columns and frames subjected to increasing loads but maintained at ambient temperature. An original derivation of the formula, which is general and based on the virtual work principle, is provided in this paper. The Rankine formula is extended to fire conditions by taking the temperature effects on steel material into consideration. Test results show that the Rankine formula yields close but slightly unsafe predictions for axially loaded columns. On the other hand, Rankine predictions for eccentrically loaded columns are very unconservative. In view of this, the present paper presents a logical approach to modify the Rankine approach so that the predictions for both axially and eccentrically loaded columns are conservative and accurate at the same time.

AB - For a long time, the Rankine method has been applied successfully to steel columns and frames subjected to increasing loads but maintained at constant ambient temperature. This paper extends the Rankine formula to frames under fire conditions. An original theoretical derivation of the formula, which is general and based on the virtual work principle, is provided in this paper. A simple expression has also been derived for the buckling coefficient of frames under fire conditions, which takes the deterioration of steel properties at elevated temperature into consideration. Comparison of test results shows that the Rankine formula yields very good predictions of critical temperatures of frames, with a mean value of 1.01 and a coefficient of variation of 9.2% for a total of 18 frames. Most importantly, it is shown that the fire resistance of steel frames can be obtained from the conventional frame analysis performed at ambient temperature.

AB - A reliability analysis of antenna towers against cumulative fatigue damage failure is presented for the gustiness of wind. Fatigue damage is evaluated by the S-N curve approach using Palmgren-Miner's rule. Application of Palmgren-Miner's rule to continuous random process is adopted for computing annual damage assuming the distribution of response to follow several types of distribution processes. The reliability against fatigue damage failure is obtained using two approaches. In the first approach, the total number of cycles of stress ranges over the design life period of the structure is assumed to follow a Weibull distribution. In the second approach, the first-order second-moment (FOSM) procedure is used. A 75 m tall antenna tower is considered as an illustrative example. The fatigue reliabilities obtained by the two different approaches are compared for a set of important parametric variations. Also, fatigue reliabilities determined by assuming different types of the distribution of responses are compared. Results of the study show that a Gaussian distribution provides the lowest estimate of the probability of fatigue failure. The probability of failure computed by the FOSM method is greater than that computed by the full distribution method. Parameters governing the wind characteristics at the site have significant influence on the probability of fatigue failure.

AB - For existing structures, information about “safe” past performance (such as prior load history) may be used to update the probability distribution of resistance and hence reliability. This technical note investigates the effect of realistic construction loading with sustained dead and live loads and extraordinary live loads on time-dependent probabilities of failure. Structural configurations considered include RC floor beams and slabs designed to ACI 318, for various live-to-dead load ratios and construction periods for typical RC multistory buildings. The results show, for example, that the probability of failure for an existing structure after 5–10 years of occupancy is one or more orders of magnitude lower than that prior to the application of construction loads. This suggests that, if a structure survives construction and early service (occupancy) loads, then its reliability is increased significantly. Finally, for cases where prior service live loads are unknown, the inclusion of construction dead loads alone will still lead to significant increases in structural reliability.

AB - A study on negative shear lag effects in box girders with varying depth is performed using a modified finite segment method developed by the writers. Three types of structures—simply supported, cantilever, and continuous box girders—under various loading conditions are considered. The investigation unveils some unique features of the positive as well as negative shear lag phenomenon in box girders with varying depth. In particular, it is found that the variation of the midspan section height to support section height ratio (h/H) has the most significant influence on the negative shear lag effect. The study also finds that the negative shear lag not only exists in cantilever and continuous box girders but also in simply supported box girders with varying depth.
