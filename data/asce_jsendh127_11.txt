AB - Recent developments in modeling the slip in steel-concrete composite beams have led to an accurate and numerically stable force-based frame element. The element assumes force fields rather than displacement fields along the element. After a brief review of the element formulation, the paper discusses a new phenomenological law for the shear connection between steel girder and concrete slab that considers stiffness and strength degradation. Correlation studies with available push-pull tests on shear connectors are used to validate the proposed model. The steel-concrete composite frame element is then applied to (1) the study of a composite structural subassemblage for which experimental data are available; and (2) the analysis of a three-story, four-bay steel building with a composite deck. In the first case, good agreement is obtained with the experimental results for both full and partial connection conditions. In the second, the study shows the increase in stiffness and strength due to the composite action. The accuracy of the force-based element leads to the use of one or two elements for a single structural member, thus allowing entire frame analyses to be performed economically.

AB - This paper presents a theoretical and computational framework for the analysis of structures that are subjected to inelastic static or dynamic overloads. Current practice in structural engineering assumes elastic material response for the analysis but applies the resulting solutions to design methods that are based on elastoplastic or perfectly plastic material response. This approach generates inaccuracies which, depending on the amount of overload, can be excessive because force distributions within statically indeterminate structures depend on the relative stiffnesses of the individual structural elements (i.e., beams and columns). The relative element stiffnesses within a structure change continuously under inelastic loading and can be significantly different from their initial elastic values. For this purpose, a new plasticity model that combines the nonlinear material response and the geometric characteristics of a structural element is developed. The model provides the computational efficiency and simplicity of matrix structural analysis and avoids modeling at the material level. Alternative analysis would require very expensive 2D or 3D finite-element computations using solid elements.

AB - This paper summarizes the results of an investigation on objective modeling and prediction of deformation localization in nonlinear force-based frame elements. Emphasis is placed on the behavior of reinforced concrete structures where localization is most likely to occur. The discussion begins with a brief review of the force-based element formulation. Next, plastic hinge behavior is classified into three categories: hardening plastic hinges, perfectly plastic hinges, and softening plastic hinges. The three types of inelastic behavior pose an increasing challenge to objective postpeak modeling. The physical and numerical characteristics of localized failure are outlined. Two regularization techniques for maintaining postpeak objectivity are proposed: (1) a constant fracture energy criterion, which provides objective response on the element force-displacement level; and (2) geometric scaling, which provides objective response on the local moment-curvature level in plastic hinge regions. The discussion concludes with three applications to different reinforced concrete structures: a frame, a bridge pier, and an overreinforced concrete beam. In all three cases, the proposed regularization technique successfully yields objective model predictions.

AB - This paper concerns the formulation of a new element-based method for the static behavior of a spatial bar, with variable cross section of an elastic and isotropic material, under arbitrary loads. Using only one element it is possible to derive the exact stiffness matrix and equivalent loads (up to any desired accuracy), for any continuous polynomial variation of axial, shear, torsional, and bending stiffnesses, and load along the member. Both the cross-section dimensions and the shape of the bar can vary along the curved member as polynomial expressions. The problem is described by six differential equations. These are second-order equations with variable coefficients, with six unknown displacements, three translations, and three rotations at every point along the member. In the proposed method the exact shape functions of the member are computed, then the terms of the stiffness matrix are found from the shape functions. Several examples are solved and compared to results from the relevant literature. Only a few parameters are needed to identify the model. In the proposed method the computational time is reduced and the results are exact. The proposed method has practical application for the design of concrete stairs and ramps.

AB - The metal roofing industry uses a variety of commonly used methods to determine the structural performance (positive load capacity and negative or uplift load capacity) of various cold-formed metal roof panel configurations. The metal roof panel system considered in this paper consists of cold-formed U-shaped panels fabricated from 0.024-in. (0.61-mm) thick coated steel that are attached to cold-formed Z-shaped 0.060-in. (1.52-mm) thick coated steel purlins using concealed clips. Uplift capacity may be calculated for a given panel section according to the approach described in the American Iron and Steel Institute specifications. Its method for calculating load capacity of metal roofing systems is considered unreliable because it typically produces results dramatically different than results obtained from actual testing. A new method of determining the load capacity of U-shaped metal roof panel systems is presented using a counterpropagation neural network. The new method accounts for distortional changes in the geometry of the roof panel system's cross section due to uniform loading, particularly negative (uplift) loading, and the failure modes that prevent the metal roof system from reaching the ultimate load. The proposed methodology provides an accurate and reliable method of determining the structural performance of a metal roof system as an alternative to testing.

AB - A nonlinear controller is developed using gain-scheduled adaptation for a six-story, base-isolated office building subjected to strong earthquakes. Several linearized models and a scheduled piecewise linear model of the structure are developed using a finite-element nonlinear model. Compensators are designed, based on the H∞ control design method using the linearized models. The family of designed compensators is then gain-scheduled. The selected scheduling variable is a combination of the interstory ductility and the measured earthquake magnitude. The performance and robustness of the gain-scheduled adaptive controller is extensively studied for a variety of earthquake records and uncertainties, ranging from structure parameter variations to controller hardware-related time delays. All controller simulations are performed using the detailed finite-element nonlinear structure model. A key advantage of the gain-scheduled adaptive controller, compared to a constant-gain controller, is the reduction of up to 40% in the applied control forces while maintaining the same closed-loop performance.

AB - A new extension for the applied-element method for structural analysis is introduced. In this method, the structure is modeled as an assembly of elements made by dividing the structure virtually. This paper first introduces the element formulation of the applied-element method. Next, the effects of the element size and arrangement are discussed, and finally, the accuracy of the proposed method in a nonlinear material case is verified by studying the behavior of RC structures under cyclic loading. For effects caused by the size and arrangement of the elements, it is shown that accurate results of stresses and strains can be obtained if elements of small size are used. As for failure behavior simulation of RC structures, the complicated behavior of cracks in structures subjected to cyclic loading, such as crack initiation and propagation, and opening and closure of cracks during the unloading process, can be simulated automatically and without any use of complicated techniques. No special knowledge about the crack location or direction of propagation is needed before the analysis. The calculated load-displacement relation and the failure load show reliable accuracy.

AB - The stiffness and geometric stiffness matrices and load vector of a prismatic beam-column with semirigid connections under any distributed axial load are presented. The derived matrices can be used in the stability and second-order analyses of 2D and 3D framed structures with sidesway uninhibited, partially inhibited, or totally inhibited in any type of construction. The effects of diagonal truss bracing and connection flexural stiffness on the lateral stability of frames are discussed. Four examples are included that show the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed method in the analysis of 2D and 3D framed structures with semirigid connections subjected to concentrated and distributed axial loads. It is shown that the stability and second-order behavior of framed structures depend on (1) geometry and column layout; (2) size and type of bracing against sidesway; (3) type and degree of restraints at the column supports; (4) type of connection (i.e., degree of restraint) and the relative flexural stiffness (EI/L) between the beams and columns; and (5) magnitude and distribution of the applied loads. The proposed stiffness and load matrices are presented in a practical form so that they can be readily applied in the computer analysis of 2D and 3D framed structures.

AB - In the past two decades, accidental failure of conical-shaped steel water tanks under hydrostatic pressure has been reported. For safety analysis, the limit analysis of such structures is formulated as a linear programming problem. Comparing with experimental and numerical results available in the literature, the accuracy of the linear programming approach is found to be high, with respect to the limit loads and failure modes of the conical shell structures. In the process of formulation, the equilibrium conditions of the problem, not the constitutive equations, are directly involved. Thus, overestimation of the stiffness for thin plates or shells resulting from inadequate constitutive equations—a phenomenon often encountered in the nonlinear finite-element analysis for thin-walled panels or shells—does not exist. Based on the internal forces at collapse, some important mechanical aspects as related to the failure mechanism and failure modes, as well as some structural characteristics, are also discussed.

AB - An optimization method is presented for long-span frames for specified seismic responses considering spatial variation of ground motions. The response is evaluated by using a response spectrum approach, where incoherency effect, wave passage effect, and local amplification effect are considered. Sensitivity coefficients of the optimum objective value with respect to the parameters defining spatial variation of the seismic motions are computed based on the parametric programming method or postoptimal analysis. It is shown that the second-order parametric sensitivity coefficients are easily obtained if the first-order coefficients vanish due to symmetry and antisymmetry conditions of structure and ground motions. In the examples, optimum designs are found for an arch-type frame and the results of postoptimal analysis are verified in comparison with the parametric sensitivity coefficients by the central difference method. It is shown that the spatial variation of ground motions leads to the increase of the optimal structural volume under constraints on member strains.

AB - Fuzzy logic control systems have been applied as an effective control system in various fields, including vibration control of structures. The advantage of this approach is its inherent robustness and ability to handle nonlinearities and uncertainties in structural behavior and loading. In this paper, the design of a multiobjective optimal fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for seismically excited building structures has been discussed. Acceleration and velocity information have been used as feedback to the FLC. Minimization of the peak acceleration and displacement response of the structure, nondimensionalized by an uncontrolled peak acceleration and displacement response, respectively, have been used as the two objectives. A two-branch tournament genetic algorithm has been used to find a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. The proposed multiobjective optimal FLC has been verified on a benchmark problem, namely, a “scaled model of a three-story building with an active mass driver system,” and the results have been compared with the results from other control methods reported in the literature. It has been shown that the use of acceleration information, in addition to velocity as a feedback for the FLC, results in better structural performance.

AB - Fuzzy membership functions are implemented in the multistage optimization technique to improve its performance for the minimum weight design of truss structures of fixed topology. First, a large truss is split into several smaller substructures that are optimized separately. However, to preserve the unity of the original truss, interaction-balance equality constraints are introduced to account for the compatibility of deformations, and the equality of the action and reaction of forces at the points of the separation of the substructures. A penalty function, containing the equilibrium equations and interaction constraints as well as other constraints, is defined for each substructure. Then, a fuzzy membership function, returning a value between 0 and 1, is introduced for each of the equality constraints to provide some fuzzy evaluation of the degree of satisfaction. This measure is then used in the determination of an appropriate penalty parameter. The design procedure is iterative and continues until convergence is achieved for all of the objective functions corresponding to the substructures. It has been found that this technique has significantly improved the convergence speed at the expense of increasing the minimum weight by a negligible amount.

AB - As an important part of the civilization in China, ancient Chinese architecture has an indigenous and unique system of construction that has retained its principal characteristics from prehistoric times to the present and spread its influence to other countries such as Korea and Japan. With the exacerbating environmental encroachment and time impacts that have been reducing their structural resistance, it has become imperative to preserve this architectural heritage. To provide the basic characteristics of the timber structures as fundamental information for research and preservation, on-site measurements and model tests were conducted on the front tower over the North Gate of the Xi'an City Wall. In the full-scale on-site tests, the vibration modes of the tower were measured. The first four natural frequencies of the structure were found to be 1.10, 1.70, 2.73, and 3.10 Hz, respectively. Multipoint excitation tests on wooden and polymethyl methacrylate (Perspex) models validate that the first and second modes obtained by the on-site full-scale test are the vibration modes of the tower. Many other valuable data and information were obtained through the tests, such as the damping ratio and the hysteresis curves.

AB - It is imperative to preserve ancient Chinese timber architecture because the impacts of time and the environment have seriously reduced the resistance capability of these historical relics. However, little information can be found to provide basic knowledge for maintenance and reinforcement. Based on an experimental study of an ancient timber structure—the front tower over the North Gate of the Xi'an City Wall in China—a semirigid finite-element model (FEM) was developed to simulate the behavior of dou gong (corbel brackets) and tenon joints and a 3D FEM model was used to study the dynamic characteristics of the structure. The FEM program SAFATS was developed to conduct dynamic and earthquake response analysis for this kind of timber structure. By comparison with experimental results, the equivalent stiffness of the semirigid element was defined and the dynamic characteristics of the structure were obtained. Based on the analysis, it was found that the use of semirigid connections in timber structures, such as dou gong (corbel brackets) and tenon joints, may reduce the magnitude of earthquake forces significantly. It is concluded that the numerical method and computational program developed in this paper are able to determine basic characteristics and to provide solutions for the maintenance and reinforcement of a timber structure.

AB - Accurate prediction of the ultimate capacity of engineering structures by numerical models depends on their ability to account for the nonlinearities involved in the problem. The use of the finite-element method often requires considerable expertise which is not widely available in the design community. Two methods of developing simple prediction equations are outlined in this paper, based on results from finite-element parametric studies of representative structures. These are applied respectively to partially restrained reinforced concrete slabs and steel pipes. A comparison with limited experimental data showed reasonable accuracy, thus suggesting that the methods could be used in a wider context.
