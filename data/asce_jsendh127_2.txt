AB - Energy dissipation systems are being increasingly employed in the United States to provide enhanced seismic protection for new and retrofit building and bridge construction. The hardware utilized includes yielding steel devices, friction devices, viscoelastic solid devices, and mostly, so far, fluid viscous devices. This hardware has been used in either diagonal or chevron brace configurations. This paper presents three new configurations that utilize toggle-brace mechanisms to substantially magnify the effect of damping devices so that they can be utilized effectively in applications of small structural drift. Shake table testing of a large scale steel model structure and analysis are used to demonstrate the utility of these configurations. The experimental results demonstrate substantial increases in the damping ratio despite the use of small size damping devices, and, accordingly, significant attenuation of the seismic response of the tested stiff structure is observed. Moreover, the experimental results are found to be consistent with analytical predictions based on either simplified methods or response history analysis. Applications of the new configurations are briefly described.

AB - Steel moment-resisting frames (MRFs) with posttensioned connections are constructed by posttensioning beams to columns using high strength strands. Top and seat angles are added to provide energy dissipation and redundancy under seismic loading. This new type of connection has several advantages, including the following: (1) field welding is not required; (2) the connection stiffness is similar to that of a welded connection; (3) the connection is self-centering; and (4) significant damage to the MRF is confined to the angles of the connection. An analytical model based on fiber elements was developed for these connections. Experimental test results were used to calibrate the model. The model was used for inelastic static analyses of interior connection subassembages as well as dynamic time history analyses of a six-story steel MRF. A self-centering capability and adequate stiffness, strength, and ductility were observed in the results of these analyses. Time history analysis results show that the seismic performance of a posttensioned steel MRF subject to the earthquake records studied here exceeds the performance of an MRF with typical welded connections subject to the same earthquake records.

AB - The completely overlapped joints of the eccentrically braced offshore jackets were investigated both experimentally and numerically. A full-scale specimen was tested under cyclic quasi-static loading. In the test, local buckling was first observed around the lap brace and through-brace intersection. A crack was then developed at the weld toe between the lap brace and the through brace, and the propagation of the crack led to the final failure of the joint. Indicators to assess the performance of the joints were evaluated within the context of seismic resistance. The energy analysis indicated that the local buckling at the intersection area was the main energy-dissipating mechanism. A comparison with an N-joint showed that the completely overlapped joint performed better under seismic loadings. An extensive finite-element analysis showed that increasing the lap brace diameter could improve the hysteresis performance of the joint while changing the gap size and the wall thickness of the through brace would have limited effects.

AB - This paper summarizes the results of the full-scale tests on beam-to-column joints, carried out within the experimental program of the COPERNICUS European research project at the “Politehnica” University of Timisoara, Romania. Two series of six double-sided joints with three different beam-to-column connection typologies have been tested under symmetrical and antisymmetrical cyclic loading. Three types of connections (extended end plate, welded, and with cover plates) have been investigated. The main parameters considered in this study are: (1) initial stiffness; (2) moment capacity; and (3) plastic rotation capacity. The obtained experimental values are compared to the theoretical predictions by means of Eurocode 3, Annex J. The antisymmetrical loading triggers the participation of the panel zone to plastic mechanism, which brings the following changes as compared to the symmetrical loading: (1) Increase of ductility; (2) decrease of moment capacity and initial stiffness; and (3) more stable energy dissipation through hysteretic loops. In any of the loading cases, the quality of welds is essential for appropriate cyclic behavior of the joints.

AB - A seismic design method for thin-walled steel frame structures is proposed in the present paper. The method employs a pushover analysis to investigate the structural nonlinear behavior. A failure criterion accounting for the characteristics of thin-walled steel members and an equivalent single–degree-of-freedom (ESDOF) system are used to estimate the capacity and demand of a structure. The proposed method is a displacement-based design procedure in which not only the global maximum drift but also the residual displacement are evaluated. Limitations of the method due to higher modal effects are also studied, and an applicable range of the ESDOF system is proposed. The method is applied to some examples, and the computed results are compared with those from multi–degree-of-freedom time-history analyses. It is found that the dynamic analysis of the ESDOF model with a simplified bilinear hysteretic model can reliably predict the global maximum drift but cannot provide satisfactory estimations for the residual displacements. Thus, empirical equations relating the residual displacement to the maximum displacement are adopted and found feasible.

AB - A simple and efficient method is presented for proportioning of regular, moderate-rise reinforced concrete building structures. The method differs from conventional procedures in that member sizes are selected based on the demand defined by the displacement spectrum and criteria specified in relation to drift response. The maximum mean drift, or average distortion over the total height, is limited to reduce the expected damage to the structure. A series of analytical reinforced concrete frames are proportioned and tested using a suite of ground motions. Results of the analyses indicated that maximum displacement responses of the proportional frames were within the specified drift limit when a maximum-allowable period criterion was satisfied.

AB - The primary objective of this study is to point out an irrationality in the existing models for shear failure, adopted by current design codes for reinforced concrete (RC) monolithic interior beam-column connections. To investigate this issue, 20 tests of RC interior beam-column connections exhibiting shear failure are reexamined. Test data indicated that joint shear stress is not proportional to story shear. Joint shear increased until the end of the test in most specimens, even if the joint shear deformation apparently increased and the story shear decreased. Moment in section at the beam end decreased due to a reduction in distance between stress resultants at the column face. The cause of the deterioration of story shear is shown to originate from a finite upper limit of anchorage capacity of beam longitudinal reinforcements passing through the beam-column connection. A new mathematical model is introduced for shear failure of the beam-column connection to reflect this behavior.

AB - Seven forced vibration tests were performed on an isolated single span of a freeway overpass structure. The tests were performed in connection with a series of states of controlled damage and repair. The work focused on horizontal forced vibration utilizing an eccentric mass shaking machine. Data was collected with an array of accelerometers. Horizontal natural frequencies and mode shapes of the structure were determined for each test. Finite-element models were created to simulate the structure. Structural parameters in the model were optimized using an algorithm to match the natural frequencies and the mode shapes from the model with those from the experimental results. The analytical and experimental results were compared. It is shown that the structural parameters optimized from the algorithm can be used to identify the condition of the structure at each state. The technique presented in this paper successfully identified the estimated location and intensity of the damage or retrofit.

AB - Wind loads on structures under the buffeting action of wind gusts have traditionally been treated by the “gust loading factor” (GLF) method in most major codes and standards around the world. In this scheme, the equivalent static wind loading used for design is equal to the mean wind force multiplied by the GLF. Although the traditional GLF method ensures an accurate estimation of the displacement response, it may fall short in providing a reliable estimate of other response components. To overcome this shortcoming, a more realistic procedure for determining design loads on tall structures is proposed. This paper highlights the new model, in which the GLF is based on the base bending moment rather than the displacement. The expected extreme base moment is computed by multiplying the mean base moment by the proposed GLF. The base moment is then distributed to each floor in terms of the floor load in a format that is very similar to the one used to distribute the base shear in earthquake engineering practice. In addition, a simple relationship between the proposed base moment GLF and the traditional GLF is derived, which makes it convenient to employ the proposed approach while utilizing the existing background information. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed procedure in light of the traditional approach.

AB - A numerical study of aluminum and steel beams subjected to concentrated loading is performed and compared with experimental data from the literature. The modeled test specimen referred to simply supported beams where the concentrated loading is applied either at the midspan or at the end support, and the influence of varying bending moment and beam overhang is investigated. The modeled cross sections cover a wide range of web geometries and flange stiffnesses, and loading through both circular bars and rectangular bars are included. The contact between the beam specimen and the loading bars is modeled with a contact algorithm, and the problem is solved by an explicit code. The correlation between the experimental and numerical results is quite good, especially for the ultimate capacity where the difference between predictions and tests is not prominent when compared to the scatter in the test results. The error in the ultimate capacity from finite-element simulations is within 14% of the measured value, and for the web deformation, simulations can predict the main effects that are obtained from the tests. The results show that small elements are necessary for predicting the correct mode of failure, and the development of the local instability depends on the mass scaling and assumed imperfection field. Furthermore, brick elements seem appropriate for including the effect of hydrostatic pressure, and the adopted fracture model seems useful for predicting the crack development that was observed for some specimens.

AB - This paper proposes a reliable and computationally efficient beam-column finite-element model for the analysis of composite (steel-reinforced concrete) members of fully encased sections under cyclic loading conditions that induce uniaxial bending and axial force. The member is discretized into longitudinal steel reinforcement, steel shape, and concrete fiber elements such that the section force-deformation relation is derived by integration of the stress-strain relation of the fibers. The nonlinear behavior of the element is derived from the nonlinear stress-strain relation of the steel and concrete fibers, with consideration of buckling of the longitudinal reinforcement and steel shape. The model, which is incorporated with the DRAIN-2DX program, is calibrated and compared with experimental data from cyclic and pseudodynamic tests of fully encased composite beam-columns. The accuracy and efficiency of the model are demonstrated through the correlation between the experimental results and analytical simulations. The crushing strains of the concrete cover predicted by the analytical simulations were significantly higher in comparison with those suggested by theoretical stress-strain models. Based on the comparison with the empirical data, stiffness reduction is suggested for the fiber model analysis. Buckling of the longitudinal reinforcement appears to be the main cause leading to severe stiffness decay of fully encased composite beam-columns.

AB - This paper describes a method of inelastic analysis that provides the necessary degree of accuracy for studying the limit-state behavior of steel frames with composite floor beams subjected to the combined action of gravity and lateral loads. An inelastic formulation is proposed to model the composite beams based on the moment-curvature relationship of a composite beam section under positive and negative moments. Steel columns are modeled using the plastic hinge approach. To ascertain the accuracy of the composite beam model, two composite beams and a steel portal frame are analyzed and the results are compared with those obtained from tests and the more established results. Finally, the robustness of the model is demonstrated by studying 2D and 3D building frames using various floor beam models so that their effects on the serviceability deflection and limit load can be compared.

AB - The concept of using neural networks to predict future values of constrained performance variables as part of an adaptive structural controller is proposed. Neural networks are first trained using simulated responses and then they are used in simulations with input disturbances having different frequency contents. Because of this, as well as other factors, one or more prespecified constraints may be violated. The neural networks are designed to permit predictions of these unsafe vibration levels, stresses, actuator saturations, etc., before they can occur. To prevent their occurrence, the control laws may be adaptively tuned, maximizing safety and reliability. To illustrate the proposed methodology, numerical examples are shown using linear quadratic Gaussian control of a simple example three-story building model subjected to earthquake excitation, with an active brace used for control. Elman neural networks are chosen, filtered white noise is used as the input disturbance for training, and actual earthquake records are used as input disturbances for testing the neural networks and finally the adaptive controller.

AB - This paper presents a probabilistic reliability assessment procedure for steel components damaged by fatigue. The crack growth model is based on the principles of fracture mechanics theory. It is compared to experimental results and gives a good prediction. The fatigue safety margin includes the crack growth from an initial crack depth to a final crack depth determined according to the fracture mechanics theory: brittle and ductile fractures. The reliability calculus is performed using a first-order reliability method. The sensitivity analysis of different parameters shows that some variables can be taken as deterministic. Applications are made on a transverse-stiffener-to-bottom-flange welded joint of a typical steel bridge.

AB - The Bayesian parameter estimation technique is used to develop probabilistic displacement capacity and demand models for reinforced concrete (RC) structural walls. These models are used to assess the seismic fragility of an example RC structural wall. Experimental data are used to develop the capacity model, and nonlinear dynamic analysis is employed to develop the demand model. In the course of developing the capacity model, probabilistic models are also developed for the plastic hinge length, the maximum usable strain of confined concrete including the effect of strain concentration, and the cyclic curvature capacity of the cross section of the wall. The probabilistic models developed in this paper are applicable to a large class of RC structural walls.
