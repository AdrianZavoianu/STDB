AB - A series of six full-scale subassemblages were tested to investigate dogbone and haunch retrofits for pre-Northridge steel moment connections. Tests included matched pairs of specimens, one bare steel and one including composite slab. Data were collected to evaluate the influence and behavior of the concrete slab. Results that emphasize the influence of the composite slab on connection behavior and specific comments on the slab response are presented. The presence of a composite slab corresponded to higher-achieved overall plastic rotations and higher-peak attained moments. Existing estimates of composite beam capacity overestimated the specimen strengths in positive moment. Shear stud failures were observed, raising concerns about the capacity of shear studs under severe reversed cyclic loading.

AB - Due to the deterioration of existing timber fender systems in waterfront facilities, high performance, composite replacement components for these structures are in demand. The performance criteria for these replacement components must meet or exceed the performance of existing timber systems. For this reason, a reliability analysis of existing timber fender systems has been performed to establish (1) the level of performance in existing timber fender systems; and (2) target performance levels for new composite replacement components. The design of waterfront fender systems is based on energy considerations. The most widely used and accepted method for determining the applied energy created by the docking ship is the kinetic energy method. Based on the applied kinetic energy of the docking ship and the response of the timber elements, a load model was developed to investigate the effect of several parameters on the system reliability. Investigations were conducted to determine the effect of variability and correlation among material properties on structural reliability. Results showed that as variability decreases and correlation increases, reliability increases. The effect of load-duration assumptions on the structural reliability was also investigated to illustrate the differences in existing fender system design criteria and current timber design standards. The results of the analysis on the timber systems are being used to set a standard for wood-plastic composite elements that will be used as replacement components in these systems.

AB - An analytical study of local buckling of discrete laminated plates or panels of fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) structural shapes is presented. Flanges of pultruded FRP shapes are modeled as discrete panels subjected to uniform axial in-plane loads. Two cases of composite plate analyses with different boundary conditions and elastic restraints on the unloaded edges are presented. By solving two transcendental equations simultaneously, the critical buckling stress resultant and the critical value of the number of buckled waves over the plate aspect ratio are obtained. Using this new solution technique and regression analysis, simplified expressions for predictions of plate buckling stress resultants are efficiently formulated in terms of coefficients of boundary elastic restraints. The effects of restraint at the flange-web connection are considered, and explicit expressions for the coefficients of restraint for I- and box-sections are given; it is shown that actual cases lie between simply supported and fully restrained (clamped) conditions. The theoretical predictions show good agreement with experimental data and finite-element eigenvalue analyses for local buckling of FRP columns. In a similar manner, web plate elements of FRP shapes under in-plane shear loads are modeled with and without elastic restraints provided by the flange panels. The present formulation can be applied to several cases to determine local buckling capacities of laminated plates with elastic restraints along the unloaded edges and can be further used to predict the local buckling strength of FRP shapes, such as columns and beams.

AB - This paper presents a derivation of exact expressions of moment-curvature relations of a circular tubular section. On the basis of these expressions and the observed behavior of full-scale specimens, an approximate method of second-order inelastic analysis applicable to pinned supported columns and modular falsework frames is presented. The approximate method is used to obtain load-deflection curves, and in the solution procedure, a set of simultaneous nonlinear equations is solved using MATHCAD. The load-deflection curves compare well with experimental results, and their application is helpful for verifying the quality of the modular tubular falsework units used in construction.

AB - It has been recognized that the mechanical properties of sheet steels and the structural strength of cold-formed steel members can be influenced by strain rate. For studying the local and postbuckling behavior of stiffened and unstiffened compression elements under a dynamic loading condition, 60 beams, which were assembled from the same material, have been tested under different strain rates. To study the structural behavior of hybrid cold-formed steel beams, a total of 72 specimens was investigated. The results showed that the strength of beams increases with increasing strain rates. The amount of increase was found to be dependent on the material yield strength, type of steel, stress-strain relationships, width-to-thickness ratio, type of compression element, and strain rate used in the test. In this research, design procedures were also developed to compute the load-carrying capacity of hybrid beams under different strain rates.

AB - A numerical study to assess the rotational capacity of aluminum alloy members is presented in this paper. In order to investigate the effects of some governing parameters on the inelastic response of aluminum beams under moment gradient, a wide parametric analysis has been carried out. This was based on the use of a FEM code ABAQUS/Standard. Reference is made to hollow rectangular cross sections, focusing on the influence of the flange slenderness, the strain hardening of the material, the shape factor of the section, the web stiffness, and member compactness. The investigations concern these factors considered separately as well as their interaction. Also, the susceptibility of aluminum beams to tensile failure, which might produce a limitation of member deformation capacity, is analyzed. The results, which have been obtained for two different alloy tempers, show the importance of some of the foregoing parameters on both buckling strength and rotational capacity of aluminum beams, emphasizing the need to improve the present guidelines provided by the European code on aluminum structures relating to cross-sectional classification.

AB - The objective of this study is to obtain a better understanding of live loads in passenger cars parking garages and to recommend an appropriate value for design. Load surveys were conducted in nine parking garages in Chicago and Urbana-Champaign, Ill., and Boston and Cambridge, Mass. Based on the survey data, statistical analyses were carried out on the equivalent uniformly distributed loads, which produce the maximum column axial loads and beam midspan moments that the building is expected to experience during its lifetime. The dynamic amplifications due to vehicle motions on the decks and ramps were also investigated. The results suggest a possible reduction of the design live load from the current value of 2.39 kN/m2 (50 psf), as stipulated in the ASCE-7-95 and other codes and standards, to 1.92 kN/m2 (40 psf), but with no allowance for reduction according to the bay area.

AB - This paper presents the use of plastic analysis methods for the calculation of critical temperature distribution for structures at collapse under fire conditions. The methods are based on the well-known plastic hinge concept using both elastoplastic and upper-bound approaches. The simple concept of plastic load factor for collapse analysis is extended to elevated temperature analysis which leads to the development of the unit load factor method for critical temperature factor calculation. The critical temperature factor is used to indicate the factor of safety for a structure under certain fire scenarios. In this approach, linearly varying distributed loads can be included in the analysis. The upper-bound approach is based on the conventional collapse mechanism calculation method, modified to include the temperature-dependent material properties. It is found that the critical collapse mechanism may become noncritical when temperature changes. A demarcation temperature multiplier is proposed to monitor such a phenomenon. Worked examples for both the elastoplastic and upper-bound approaches are presented.

AB - This study focuses on the probabilistic assessment of reinforced concrete (RC) frames infilled with clay brick walls and subjected to earthquake loading. The adopted methodology extends that previously developed by the writers for bare RC frames by introducing additional random variables to account for the uncertainty in the masonry properties. Quantification of the latter is achieved through the use of experimental data describing the difference in force-displacement behavior between bare and infilled frames. The vulnerability and seismic reliability of two 10-story, three-bay infilled frames (a fully infilled one and one with a soft ground story) are derived and subsequently compared with values corresponding to the bare frame counterpart. It is found that failure probabilities, especially at the ultimate limit state, are highly sensitive to the structural stiffness; hence, bare frames benefit from lower spectral ordinates than infilled ones. Nonetheless, all structural systems studied appear to be exposed to a reasonably low seismic risk.

Stability design criteria for bird-shaped girders are proposed for practical use. The proposed criteria have been used to evaluate the buckling capacities of several newly constructed bird-shaped roof structures and full-scale specimens. A good conservative estimation is generally observed.

AB - The objective of this investigation is to verify the applicability of a number of nonlinear damage accumulation theories in the context of composite FRP laminates subjected to simulated stochastic loadings. Although nonlinear damage accumulation methods for composite materials have been investigated for a few decades, most comparisons with experimental results have considered only two-stress-level loadings; none has considered stochastic loadings. The nonlinear damage models considered in this study are primarily those obtained as a result of the strength-deterioration and stiffness-deterioration approaches. The fatigue data used in this investigation are generated from laminated specimens made of cross-ply E-glass woven-roving fibers and vinyl ester resin. Constant-amplitude tests are conducted to obtain the material's S-N curve. Variable-amplitude fatigue tests are carried out using simulated narrowband stochastic stress histories with various root-mean-square stresses. In addition to the experimental results, the predictions based on the nonlinear damage accumulation techniques are compared with those based on the linear (Palmgren-Miner) damage accumulation rule. It is found that, for the cases investigated in this study, the nonlinear damage models most often yield fatigue life predictions that are generally comparable to those predicted by the linear model; predictions in most cases are conservative.

AB - An efficient and accurate algorithm is proposed to evaluate risk in the time domain for nonlinear structures subjected to short duration dynamic loadings, especially seismic loading. The algorithm is based on the stochastic finite-element concept. Uncertainties in the dynamic and seismic excitation and the resistance-related parameters are incorporated by modeling them as realistically as possible. The proposed algorithm integrates the concepts of the response surface method, the finite-element method, the first-order reliability method, and the iterative linear interpolation scheme. Two iterative response surface schemes consisting of second-order polynomials (with and without cross terms) are proposed. A mixture of saturated and central composite design is used to assure both efficiency and accuracy in the algorithm. Sensitivity analysis is used to improve the efficiency further. The risk corresponding to both the serviceability and strength limit states is estimated. The unique feature of the algorithm is that actual earthquake loading time histories can be used to excite structures, enabling a realistic representation of the loading conditions. The algorithm is further clarified with the help of two examples.

AB - In view of the large damage suffered in recent earthquakes and hurricanes, building design criteria are developed to protect life and reduce damage and loss to an acceptable level. The problem is minimizing the expected total life-cycle cost with respect to the design load and resistance. Load uncertainty includes occurrence time, intensity, and duration. The costs of construction, maintenance, and failure consequences, including deaths and injuries, as well as discounting cost over time, are considered. Optimal values are obtained of design variables and target reliability under single and multiple time-varying loads. Also investigated is sensitivity of the optimal design to important loading and structural parameters. The optimal design is found to depend primarily on the limit state consequences (costs), and to a lesser degree on the structural life. For multiple hazards, the optimal design is controlled by the hazard with large uncertainty and severe failure consequences. In a companion paper applications are given of the method to design multistory office buildings against earthquakes and winds.

AB - The design criteria for a nine-story office building, subject to earthquakes and winds, are developed based on the method in the companion paper. The seismic and wind hazards, structural response analyses, and cost estimates are based on recent literature. Structural limit states in the nonlinear range and consequences are considered. The optimal design is obtained by minimizing the total expected life-cycle cost using a numerical procedure. A sensitivity analysis is conducted comparing the optimal design to the important but controversial parameters, such as design life, death and injury cost, structural capacity uncertainty, and discount rate. The method is applied to design under earthquakes, winds, and both hazards at Los Angeles, Seattle, and Charleston, South Carolina, and compared with current design. As expected, the seismic load controls the optimal design in Los Angeles. The optimal design is “dominated” by seismic load in Seattle and wind load in Charleston. These hazards, however, do not “control” or “govern” the design, for the lesser hazard still contributes significantly. Also, contrary to common belief, uniform reliability against different hazards is not required.
