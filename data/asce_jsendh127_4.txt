AB - The results of analytical investigations are presented supporting the disturbed stress field model as a viable conceptual model for describing the behavior of cracked reinforced concrete elements. The theory is shown to be phenomenologically more correct, relative to typical fixed-crack or rotating-crack models, in its representation of the rotation of stress and strain fields in cracked concrete. The inclusion of rigid slip along crack surfaces allows for a divergence between principal stress and principal strain directions in the concrete, with the rotation of stresses and crack directions shown to typically lag behind that of strains. This behavior is found to be consistent with experimentally observed response. Corroboration with data from beam, panel, and shear wall test specimens shows the theory to accurately model response over a wide range of conditions. In general, results are improved relative to those obtained from the modified compression field theory. Current deficiencies in the theory are identified, and possible future work is discussed.

AB - Design and detailing requirements for composite concrete beams are specified in clause 17.5 of building code 318 of the American Concrete Institute. These requirements rely on monolithic action of the entire cross section to develop flexural and shear resistance, and for deflection control. Detailing of the interface between the precast web and cast-in-place flange to resist horizontal shear in a composite concrete beam is crucial in developing a monolithic action for such beams. This paper presents the results of recent research on the behavior of composite concrete beams with a smooth interface. Current provisions of the American Concrete Institute's code on flexural strength, shear strength, and deflection characteristics are found to be satisfactory. However, the code clauses dealing with horizontal shear are found to be very conservative. Based on test results, an equation to represent the shear transfer strength of a smooth interface is developed. Suitable suggestions are made for consideration during the future revisions to design codes.

AB - Bonding by epoxy resins of metallic or nonmetallic plates to the tension face of a reinforced concrete (RC) member (i.e., plate bonding technology) is now a widely used technique to retrofit/upgrade existing RC structures that have been damaged or are structurally inadequate. To ensure successful and cost-effective applications, engineers must improve their knowledge of the actual behavior of these structures, especially with regard to the interaction mechanisms between concrete and the bonded plate. This paper presents a truss model capable of describing the ultimate behavior of externally bonded RC beams. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by comparing the obtained numerical results with some experimental data that is available in the literature.

AB - The technique of strengthening or repairing reinforced concrete (RC) structures with externally bonded steel plates or composite sheets has been successfully applied in civil engineering. The RC structure is often strengthened in flexure. This work studies the effect of the shear strengthening of RC beams on the stress distribution, initial cracks, crack propagation, and ultimate strength. Five types of beams with different strengthening carbon-fiber–reinforced plastic sheets are used. The experimental results show that it is not necessary to strengthen the entire concrete beam surface. The general and regional behaviors of concrete beams with bonded carbon-fiber–reinforced plastic sheets are studied with the help of strain gauges. The appearance of the first cracks and the crack propagation in the structure up to the failure is monitored and discussed for five different strengthened beams. In particular, for one of the strengthened RC beams, the failure mode and the failure mechanism are fully analyzed.

AB - A nonlinear analysis, based on the closed-form high-order approach, for the behavior of cracked reinforced concrete beams, retrofitted with externally bonded fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) strips, is presented. The model is based on equilibrium, compatibility of deformations, and the nonlinear constitutive relations of the various materials. The nonlinear implicit governing equations are derived and are solved through an iterative linearized procedure. Verification of the nonlinear model is achieved through comparison of the load-deflection response with the experimental result. The results of the proposed analysis include global effects such as load-deflection response and the development of the tensile stresses in the FRP strip and localized effects such as the shear and peeling stresses near the edge of the strip. The study reveals that the extreme values of the stresses at the edge region and the in-plane stress resultant in the strip exhibits nonlinear dependence on the imposed load, which the linear approach is incapable of predicting. Thus, the use of linear analysis for cracked concrete beams underestimates the stresses in the FRP strip and in the adhesive layer. Prestressing of the FRP strip is investigated, revealing that the strip must be properly anchored to exploit its advantages. This paper ends with a summary and conclusions.

AB - Although a great deal of research has been carried out in recent years on the use of plate bonding for strengthening reinforced concrete (RC) structures, so far this work has generally been limited to RC beams and one-way slabs, with little work on two-way slabs. This paper presents the results of a recent study on the behavior and strength of two-way square RC slabs bonded with a steel plate. Experimental load-deflection curves, failure modes, and strengths of plated slabs under a central concentrated load are first reported. These results show that debonding failures are unlikely in these plated slabs, contrary to the case of plated beams, and there are significant strength gains due to the bonded steel plate as a result of a modified yield line pattern. Yield line analyses are then described for these slabs, and the results are found to match experimental results closely. The yield line method is thus suitable for practical use to determine the strength of these plated slabs.

AB - A tendon model based on the finite-element method, that can represent the interaction between tendon and concrete of the prestressed concrete member, is proposed. Especially for multitendon cases, this model is capable of simulating the slip of tendon in concrete duct so it can deal with the prestressing transfer of posttensioned structures and calculate unbonded prestressed structures more efficiently. Another relevant model is also proposed to represent friction and bond at the interface of tendon and concrete. By using these models, a numerical procedure is established for material and geometric nonlinear analysis of prestressed concrete structures, including time-dependent effects due to load history, relaxation of prestress, and creep and shrinkage of concrete. The procedure can predict the responses of pretensioned and bonded or unbonded posttensioned plane concrete structures such as elastic and plastic deformation, cracking, and damage patterns throughout their prestressing transfer and service-load history. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the present method. Comparison of computed results with experimental ones shows good agreement.

AB - The possibility of safely extending the life of existing infrastructure is a matter that has become of increasing importance for the work of structural engineers, particularly when seen in the widest context of structural engineering. This paper proposes the view that the profession must be able to provide defendable estimates of the safety of individuals and of the safety and performance of existing structural systems. It will be argued that to do so requires prediction of future structural behavior at a level of detail and accuracy not hitherto required from the profession. Meeting this challenge opens up very extensive basic and applied research needs in structural engineering. These include better understanding and modeling of load processes and their rational combination; better understanding of structural system behavior and the influences of largely unknowable boundary and construction conditions; and much better understanding and modeling of processes such as fatigue, corrosion, deterioration of paint, and other protection systems. Moreover, it is argued that assessment procedures still require fundamentally acceptable and rational decision frameworks able to justify structural adequacy in terms increasingly being demanded by safety and environmental regulators.

AB - The results of a comprehensive research study on the effect of fastener holes on the reliability of structural timbers, specifically No. 2 Douglas fir 102 × 303 mm (nominal 4 × 8 in.) structural joists and planks, is reported. Through this study, adjustment factors are developed to account for the presence of a hole as a function of its size and location within the member. Such adjustment factors could be used in design by the engineer, or perhaps more appropriately, grading agencies to develop appropriate grading procedures and design values for reused or recycled timbers to ensure acceptable levels of safety. The specific objectives of this paper are, therefore, to (1) quantify and determine the effect of a fastener hole on the reliability of wood beams when various diameter holes are located at various positions throughout the depth; and (2) develop and recommend possible adjustment factors to account for the reduction in reliability created by the presence of a fastener hole. The reduction in reliability caused by a 44.5 mm hole was found not to be significantly different from that caused by a 25.4 mm hole. The reliability, however, is significantly affected by hole location. If the hole is located at the point of maximum moment, the reduction in reliability is over twice as much as when the hole is located randomly within the central third of the length, which is similar to the grading criteria for knots. For a flexural member containing a 25.4–44.5 mm hole anywhere within the central third of the length, the recommended adjustment factor is ω′ = 0.90. In other words, a 10% reduction in design capacity is recommended when such a fastener hole is present in the central third of the member's length.

A method of global nondestructive evaluation for identifying local damage and decay in timber beams is investigated in this paper. Experimental modal analysis is used in conjunction with a previously developed damage localization algorithm. The damage localization algorithm utilizes changes in modal strain energy between the mode shapes of a calibrated model, representing the undamaged state of the beam of interest, and the experimentally obtained mode shapes for a timber beam. Analytical evaluations were performed to demonstrate and verify the use of this method of global nondestructive evaluation for the localization of damage or decay in timber beams. In a companion paper, experimental laboratory tests are presented that verify the use of dynamic system identification to locate damage within timber beams.

AB - In a companion paper, a method of global nondestructive evaluation (NDE) for identifying local damage and decay in timber beams was developed and verified analytically using a finite-element model of a timber beam. The previously presented method of damage localization employs experimental modal analysis and an algorithm that monitors changes in modal strain energy between the mode shapes of a damaged beam with respect to the undamaged state of the beam. In this second part of a two-part paper, experimental laboratory tests on simply supported timber beams are presented to verify the capabilities and determine the limitations of the proposed method of NDE in locating simulated damage in simply supported timber beams. Due to the natural variability inherent within a timber beam, the required severity of inflicted damage before the algorithm could correctly identify damage location was a 5.08-cm (2-in.) deep saw cut in a beam with a depth of 15.88 cm (6.25 in.). For practical applications, the proposed technique could be used to identify the presence and general location of severe decay or damage, and if needed, more refined NDE techniques could be used to map the specific region affected by the decay or damage.

AB - A simple numerical model to predict the load-displacement response and energy dissipation characteristics of wood shear walls under general quasi-static cyclic loading is presented. In this model the shear wall is composed of three structural components: rigid framing members, linear elastic sheathing panels, and nonlinear sheathing-to-framing connectors. The hysteretic model for the sheathing-to-framing connector takes account of pinching behavior and strength and stiffness degradation under cyclic loading. A robust displacement control solution strategy is utilized to predict the wall response under general cyclic loading protocols. The shear wall model has been incorporated into the computer program CASHEW (Cyclic Analysis of SHEar Walls). The predictive capabilities of this program are compared with monotonic and cyclic tests of full-scale wood shear walls. It is shown that this model can accurately predict the load-displacement response and energy dissipation characteristic of wood shear walls under general cyclic loading. As an application of the CASHEW program, a procedure is presented for calibrating a single degree-of-freedom system to predict the complete nonlinear dynamic response of shear walls under seismic loading.

AB - Threaded nails are used in wood construction because of their superior performance, but relatively few tests have been conducted on nails larger than 12d (3.76 mm diameter). Experience has suggested that threaded nail withdrawal design values are too conservative. The Forest Products Laboratory and Washington State University have been cooperatively characterizing the strength of threaded nails over a range of wood species and nail types. This paper focuses on the immediate withdrawal strength of annularly threaded nails in Douglas Fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir, helically threaded nails in Southern Pine, and smooth nails in Southern Pine and Spruce-Pine-Fir lumber. Average withdrawal strength of threaded nails was greater than that of smooth shank nails of the same diameter. In comparison of experimental withdrawal strength to existing design procedures for assigning allowable withdrawal strength design values, annular shank nails showed the greatest difference. Withdrawal strengths of nails from five different manufacturers were not significantly different. Comparisons of the effect of galvanizing on withdrawal strength were inconclusive.

AB - A framed-tube system with multiple internal tubes is analyzed using an orthotropic box beam analogy approach in which each tube is individually modeled by a box beam that accounts for the flexural and shear deformations as well as the shear-lag effects. The method idealizes the tubes-in-tube structure as a system of equivalent multiple tubes, each composed of four equivalent orthotropic plate panels capable of carrying axial loads and shear forces. By simplifying the assumptions in relation to the patterns of strain distributions in external and internal tubes, the structural analysis is reduced to the mere solution of a single second-order linear differential equation. The proposed method, which is intended to be used as a tool for preliminary design purposes, can be applied for the analysis of framed-tube structures with single and multiple internal tubes as well as those without internal tubes. The simplicity and accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated through the analysis of three framed-tube structures (of different heights) without internal tubes. A 3D frame analysis program and two existing approximate methods are also included in the comparative study. Furthermore, three other framed-tube structures with one, two, and three internal tubes are analyzed to verify the applicability and reliability of the proposed method.

AB - A simple analytical approach based on the Rankine principle has been developed to determine the ultimate resistance of steel frames in fire. The proposed Rankine approach gives an approximation of the frames' fire resistance through a simple interaction between two idealized structural behaviors—strength and stability. Here, the strength and stability of the structures are evaluated using the rigid-plastic and the elastic buckling analyses, both incorporating the thermal effects. The proposed approach is first verified using a finite-element model. The verification studies include the effects of column and frame slenderness ratios, beam-column stiffness ratio, steel grades, initial sway imperfections, and initial residual stresses. These studies indicate that frame slenderness ratio is an important parameter governing the behavior of simple frames in fire, and the performance of the proposed approach is related to it. The Rankine approach is then applied to a series of 18 test frames from the literature. It is shown that the proposed approach can provide predictions with sufficient accuracy for simple frames in fire.
