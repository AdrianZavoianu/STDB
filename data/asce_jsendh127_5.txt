AB - A simplified analysis procedure has been developed to consider accidental torsion in building design that is rational and convenient relative to building codes. This procedure is extended and evaluated in this paper against measured accidental torsion determined from motions of 12 buildings—with nominally-symmetric plan—recorded during Northridge (1994), Loma Prieta (1989), Whittier (1987), and Upland (1990) earthquakes. The selected buildings include structures in reinforced concrete and in steel that cover a wide range of structural systems, including moment resisting frames, shear walls, braced frames, and hybrid systems. After the measured torsion is interpreted and compared to analytical estimates, it is demonstrated that this procedure is sufficiently accurate to be used in design applications.

AB - The three-dimensional inelastic earthquake response of a seven-story reinforced-concrete building during the 1994 Northridge earthquake is studied herein. The objectives of this investigation are as follows: (1) to understand the inelastic behavior of the building using recorded motions; and (2) to propose a simplified inelastic model that could explain the lateral-torsional coupling observed in this nominally symmetric building. Because several two-dimensional inelastic models of the building have been reported by other researchers, this paper focuses on the three-dimensional behavior of the structure. Response results of a simplified inelastic stick model that uses the story-shear and torque surfaces are compared with the results obtained from a conventional elastic three-dimensional building model. These results suggest that damage in the building occurred in the first few cycles of the response, and that the building showed markedly inelastic torsional behavior in spite of its nominal symmetry in plan. Such torsional behavior could also occur in other symmetric-plan buildings with strong perimeter frames, and constitutes a rather new phenomenon that should be studied further. It is proposed herein that such behavior be foreseen in design by using the concept of the ultimate story-shear and torque surface.

AB - Three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic time-history analyses of a three-story steel moment-resisting frame designed according to the Uniform Building Code for Los Angeles seismicity were carried out. Beams in both directions had moment connections to the hollow rectangular columns. Code drift limits, rather than code considerations for bidirectional horizontal shaking, governed the member sizes. It was found that design level shaking caused the structure to exceed story yield drifts in both directions simultaneously and significant column yielding occurred above the base. Shaking in the direction orthogonal to the main shaking direction increased drifts in the main shaking direction by 46 and 64% for the design level and near-fault records, respectively, indicating that 2D analyses would not estimate the 3D response well. Also, maximum horizontal seismic components of axial force in the corner columns and side columns were 4.87 and 5.30 times the code estimations, respectively. It was shown that by increasing the column strength above the present code levels, that drifts during near-fault shaking were significantly decreased. A methodology to encourage strong-column weak-beam behavior, and to more realistically estimate the column axial forces during design level shaking is described.

AB - The results of 48 T-stub component tests and eight full-scale T-stub connection tests are used to develop and calibrate a comprehensive T-stub connection stiffness model. The model, based on basic component spring theory, incorporates deformations from tension bolt elongation, bending of the T-stub flange, elongation of the T-stem, slip of the T-stub relative to the beam flange, bearing deformation of the T-stem, and bearing deformation of the beam flange. Nonlinear material models, for both the tension bolts and the T-stub base material, are included. A sophisticated slip/bearing routine accounts for the misalignment of shear bolt holes and variable slip conditions. Comparisons of multilinear model predictions with experimental data show that the model accurately predicts connection stiffness response and deformation at failure.

AB - The seismic provisions of the 1997 Uniform Building Code (UBC) are examined from the perspective of achieving performance-based earthquake engineering of structural wall buildings. It is shown that although strain limits are present in the 1997 UBC, the drift ratio limits generally govern design. The conflict between assumed force reduction factors and actual ductility demand at the design limit state controlled by drift is also explored. Through the use of design examples and dynamic inelastic time history analysis it is shown that attempts to achieve performance-based engineering with a force-based approach such as that described in the 1997 UBC will inevitably not be possible. As an alternative, it is shown that a simple and more rational direct displacement-based approach would better achieve the objectives of performance-based earthquake engineering.

AB - This and the companion paper present an analysis of the amplitude and time-dependent changes of the apparent frequency of a seven-story reinforced-concrete hotel building in Van Nuys, Calif. Data of recorded response to 12 earthquakes are used, representing very small, intermediate, and large excitations (peak ground velocity, vmax = 0.6 − 11, 23, and 57 cm/s, causing no minor and major damage). This paper presents a description of the building structure, foundation, and surrounding soil, the strong motion data used in the analysis, the soil-structure interaction model assumed, and results of Fourier analysis of the recorded response. The results show that the apparent frequency changes form one earthquake to another. The general trend is a reduction with increasing amplitudes of motion. The smallest values (measured during the damaging motions) are 0.4 and 0.5 Hz for the longitudinal and transverse directions. The largest values are 1.1 and 1.4 Hz, respectively, determined from response to ambient noise after the damage occurred. This implies 64% reduction of the system frequency, or a factor ≈3 change, from small to large response amplitudes, and is interpreted to be caused by nonlinearities in the soil.

AB - In this, the second of a two-part paper, the analysis of the apparent frequency of a seven-story reinforced-concrete hotel building in Van Nuys, Calif., is extended to consider its time-dependent changes, both short and long term. The instantaneous apparent frequency is measured by two methods: windowed Fourier analysis and zero-crossings analysis. The results show that it changes from earthquake to earthquake and during a particular earthquake. The results also suggest “self healing” believed to result from settlement of the soil with time and dynamic compaction from aftershock shaking. Implications of such high variability of the system frequency on structural health monitoring, control of response, as well as on the design codes are discussed. Nonlinear response of the foundation soil acts as a sink of the incident seismic wave energy. It is suggested that it could be exploited in future designs to serve as a powerful and inexpensive energy-dissipation mechanism.

AB - The fracture of beam-to-column connections of steel buildings in the Northridge and Kobe earthquakes generated concerns about the reliability of current design and construction technology for steel connections. The same type of fracturing may occur at similar beam-to-column connections of steel buildings in other seismically active areas. A simple method is proposed here to enhance the ductility of beam-to-column connections of existing buildings. By trimming the bottom flange of the beam slightly, the ductility of the connection can be greatly improved. Experimental studies of the newly designed connections under cyclic load show that the ultimate strengths are almost unaltered; however, the plastic rotational capacity can be increased significantly. When adopting the proposed method, the only work needed is to trim part of the bottom flange plate, and this can be done without removing the floor slab. The proposed connection method can be easily implemented to enhance the ductility of beam-to-column connections of existing buildings.

AB - In this paper, modeling approaches describing the hysteretic behavior of reinforced-concrete columns subjected to cyclic deformation reversals are investigated. The inelastic flexure and shear response of a reinforced-concrete column subjected to cyclic deformation is evaluated utilizing lumped hysteretic representations that exhibit efficiency and ease of modeling. The analytical predictions obtained with the new formulations are compared with experimental results from the literature. Comparisons between results with and without shear interaction reveal the importance of the flexure-shear interrelationship and the adequacy of the proposed approach in terms of strength and stiffness predictions.

AB - This paper addresses the inelastic dynamic response of simply supported bridges to ground motion in their transverse direction. The effect of the relative substructure-superstructure flexibility on the inelastic response of bridges was studied for symmetric spans. The bridges are modeled as beams with distributed mass and elasticity, simply supported at the ends by elasto-plastic springs. An analytical extension of the common generalized single degree of freedom model into the inelastic range is presented. Flexibility of the capacity-protected structural elements is shown to add significantly to the ductility demand of the energy dissipating components of bridge systems. A simple method was developed to account for these flexibilities when assessing bridge response beyond its elastic range. Numerical case studies are presented to illustrate the new analytical tool.

AB - Three masonry walls with their wood backing were extracted from an old three-story residential building. These specimens are representative of a type of construction widely used in North America circa 1900, in which a single wythe exterior masonry wall was tied only with nails to the timber structure, leaving an irregular gap between the masonry and timber walls. To seismically retrofit such buildings, special seismic-resistant anchorage of the walls would be required at every floor at a minimum. Questions remained, however, as to the out-of-plane resistance of the remaining walls spanning between floors. To partly answer these questions, the three specimens extracted from the existing building were tested using a shake table, submitting them to multiple ground motions of progressively larger intensity until structural failure. These tests have demonstrated that such walls could resist significant out-of-plane inertial accelerations without failure. Performance can be increased by different retrofit methods such as providing anchors at midheight to force the wood and masonry wall to move as a unit, and adding fiberglass strips epoxied to the masonry wall to increase its out-of-plane stiffness and strength.

AB - This paper develops a new solver to enhance the computational efficiency of finite-element programs for the nonlinear analysis and reanalysis of structural systems. The proposed solver does not require the reassembly of the global stiffness matrix and can be easily implemented in present-day finite-element packages. It is particularly well suited to those situations where a limited number of members are changed at each step of an iterative optimization algorithm or reliability analysis. It is also applicable to a nonlinear analysis where the plastic zone spreads throughout the structure due to incremental loading. This solver is based on an extension of the Sherman-Morrison-Woodburg formula and is applicable to a variety of structural systems including 2D and 3D trusses, frames, grids, plates, and shells. The solver defines the response of the modified structure as the difference between the response of the original structure to a set of applied loads and the response of the original structure to a set of pseudoforces. The proposed algorithm requires O(mn) operations, as compared with traditional solvers that need O(m2n) operations, where m = bandwidth of the global stiffness matrix and n = number of degrees of freedom. Thus, the pseudoforce method provides a dramatic improvement of computational efficiency for structural redesign and optimization problems, since it can perform a nonlinear incremental analysis no harder than the inversion of the global stiffness matrix. The proposed method's efficiency and accuracy are demonstrated in this paper through the nonlinear analysis of an example bridge and a frame redesign problem.

AB - A new inverse design method for frames has been presented by means of an inverse formulation including frame stability effects. Elastic building frames in non-earthquake-prone areas, designed primarily for light horizontal wind loads, are considered. Governing equations based on the well-known second-order slope-deflection equations are derived for fundamental problems for a set of specified member-end fiber bending strains, as a target performance. An explicit expression for the solution stiffnesses is obtained for a hybrid-inverse problem. Further consideration is given for a class where the member stiffness set is determined only by a strain mode such as for a frame consisting of columns under central compression. It is demonstrated that the strain mode of an entire multistory frame can be synthesized by overlapping of the strain modes of decomposed unit frames. The design formulas for the simple models in this paper not only have disclosed the essential characteristics of design solutions but also play the role of initial backbone solutions in the neighborhood of which perturbed solutions can be derived for problems under more practical conditions.

AB - The major sources of energy dissipation, lateral deformation, and base shear in steel frames with partially restrained (PR) connections subjected to seismic loading are analytically studied. The analytical study confirms, in general, the behavior observed during experimental investigation: PR connections reduce the overall stiffness of frames, but add a major source of energy dissipation. It is observed, in general, that the maximum total base shear may significantly increase as the connection stiffness increases. The maximum top lateral displacement does not always increase with a decrease in the connection stiffness. The response under earthquake loading largely depends on the dynamic characteristics of both the structure and the earthquake excitation. Proper consideration of the stiffness of the PR connections and other dynamic properties is essential to predict the dynamic behavior, no matter how difficult the analysis procedure becomes.
