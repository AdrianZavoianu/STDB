AB - This paper describes a series of compression tests on cold-formed equal angles with slender cross section. The angles were tested between pinned ends and loaded axially with eccentric load, which caused bending parallel with a leg. The test data are compared with the design rules of the Australian and American specifications for cold-formed and hot-rolled steel structures, as well as an ASCE standard. The rules of the specifications for cold-formed steel structures are shown to be very conservative. The cause of the conservatism is explained and improved design rules are proposed.

AB - Composite panels in this study consist of C-section steel wall studs with gypsum wallboard attached to both flanges of the stud with screws at regular intervals. Axial load is assumed to be applied to the centroid of the gross cross section for each stud. Bracing from the wallboard, connected by screws, is represented by elastic springs in the analysis. The panel is subject to both flexural and torsional-flexural buckling modes. Using the differential equation of equilibrium, the flexural and torsional-flexural buckling loads are evaluated for typical end-conditions. Local buckling effects and nominal buckling stress are determined according to the 1986 and 1996 AISI specifications. Predictions and observed strengths from the limited experimental database are in good agreement. The predictions accurately represent the overall torsional-flexural buckling observed for the gypsum board-braced, steel wall studs. The strength is independent of study spacing, reflecting the localized nature of the wallboard deformations, rather than the shear diaphragm behavior assumed in the current AISI specification.

AB - Currently, designers experience difficulty when trying to gauge the flexural ductility of a given single angle member due to the lack of single angle flexural compactness criteria in the American steel building specification. In fact, many designers may believe that single angle beams are incapable of developing their full cross-sectional plastic capacity due to this omission in the specification. As a result, few engineers are willing to exploit the advantages associated with employing plastic analysis and design methodologies to proportion single angle members. The research reported herein applies experimentally verified, nonlinear finite-element modeling techniques to the study of geometric axis flexural ductility for the flexural sense, where the horizontal leg of the angle cross section is in tension. It is shown that compactness criteria must be given in terms of both cross-sectional plate slenderness as well as beam slenderness. It is further observed that the grade of steel plays an important role in affecting compactness. Based on the results of the present study, a design equation is proposed as a means for predicting equal leg, single angle compactness for this flexural orientation. The equation has been developed so as to lend itself to everyday use by the designer.

AB - A viable alternative to reinforced concrete coupling beams with heavily reinforced diagonal struts is steel or steel-concrete composite beams. A limited number of previous studies have examined various issues related to design of steel coupling beams. In this and a companion paper, cyclic response of steel-concrete composite coupling beams is addressed. The research results show that nominally reinforced encasement around steel coupling beams contributes to the strength and stiffness, and web stiffener plates can essentially be eliminated as the encasement provides adequate lateral stability for the shear-yielding web coupling beams. Although current design practice is conservative in terms of design and detailing of the beam, the overall behavior of composite coupling beams is not necessarily conservative. The design needs to consider the additional stiffness and strength in order to ensure proper calculation of design forces in the walls and coupling beams, and to dissipate the input energy through formation of plastic hinges in the beam and not in the connection region. Revision of current design guidelines is recommended.

AB - As shown in a companion paper, the embedment length of steel-concrete composite coupling beams inside wall piers should be computed by incorporating the contribution of the encasement. In lieu of detailed fiber-based analytical techniques, a simple design-oriented model was developed and verified through testing of additional specimens with more realistic loading and boundary conditions. Moreover, the influence of face-bearing plates and floor slab was examined. The developed design method results in longer embedment length, and significantly enhanced energy-dissipating characteristics, strength, stiffness, and ductility. Additional improvements are possible by using face-bearing plates. The contribution of floor slab toward stiffness of the coupling beam is lost at small deformations and may be ignored. Slab participation toward the strength of the steel-concrete composite coupling beams is different from that anticipated for conventionally reinforced concrete beams because of the amount of equivalent reinforcement provided by the flanges of the steel coupling beam.

AB - When a steel I-section beam that is curved in plan is subjected to vertical (or transverse) loading, its primary actions are bending about its major axis and torsion. Secondary torsion and minor axis bending actions are usually significant in steel I-section beams curved in plan under combined bending and torsion. However, the common circular interaction equation used in practice for rectangular solid or hollow section curved beams does not account for these significant effects and so may overestimate the interaction strength of steel I-section beams curved in plan under bending and torsion. This paper investigates the nonlinear elastic-plastic behavior of steel I-section beams curved in plan under vertical loading and proposes straightforward formulas for their design against combined bending and torsion actions. Comparisons with rational finite-element results and existing experimental results show that the proposed interaction equations provide a good lower bound for the design of steel I-section beams curved in plan against combined bending and torsion. The proposed interaction equations are simple and consistent with existing codified design rules.

AB - A beam-column element for simulating the inelastic behavior of 3D mixed frame structures comprised of steel, reinforced concrete, and/or composite members is presented. The formulation makes use of the flexibility method for deriving the element stiffness equations. A stress-resultant bounding surface plasticity model provides the sectional properties, which are then integrated along the length to generate the stiffness matrices. For steel members, the plasticity model is based on two nested surfaces, whereas for composite and reinforced concrete members the inner loading surface is degenerated to a point. Stiffness degradation of reinforced concrete and composite members is incorporated as a function of dissipated strain energy. Implementation and verification of the models for static and dynamic time-history analyses of mixed steel-concrete space frames are presented in a companion paper.

Described in a companion paper is the flexibility-based formulation of a three-dimensional beam-column element to model the inelastic cyclic behavior of beam-columns under combined axial load and biaxial bending. This paper describes the development of yield surface equations and stiffness parameter calibration for bisymmetric steel, reinforced concrete, and encased composite beam-columns. Accuracy of the model is verified through comparisons to data from previously published tests and detailed analyses.

AB - Composite sections are being increasingly used as columns in multistory buildings. These sections provide considerable economy as they eliminate plywood formwork and allow large percentages of steel to be utilized in their application. The initial local buckling load of these sections is enhanced by the presence of the concrete infill and this allows very slender steel plates to be used in their fabrication. This paper investigates the local and postlocal buckling behavior of welded sections as box or wide flange I-sections. An extensive set of experiments was conducted on both hollow and concrete-filled steel box sections. Furthermore, a detailed study of flange outstands with and without concrete infill is considered in this paper. A numerical model based on the finite strip method is used to determine the initial local buckling stress incorporating residual stresses, and this is shown to agree well with the experiments. Finally, an effective width model developed elsewhere and presented in existing international codes is augmented and calibrated with the test results. This method is found to be useful in determining the axial compressive strength of these cross sections.

AB - In this paper, an iterative quasi-Newton procedure based on the Regula-Falsi numerical scheme is proposed for the rapid sectional analysis and design of short concrete-encased composite columns of arbitrary cross section subjected to biaxial bending. The stress resultants of the concrete are evaluated by integrating the concrete stress-strain curve over the compression zone. Exact integral expressions of the stress resultants for both polygonal and circular subsections are derived, and these are used to achieve an efficient and accurate analysis. The stress resultants of the encased structural steel and the steel reinforcing bars are obtained using the fiber element method. A particularly important feature of the present method is the use of the plastic centroidal axes of the cross section as the reference axes of loading in the iterative solution process. This ensures the convergence of the solution process for all cross-sectional conditions. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity, accuracy, and capability of the proposed method.

AB - The work presented in this paper represents the first step of a research activity aimed at the prediction of the plastic rotation supply of partial-strength bolted connections, starting from the knowledge of their geometrical and mechanical properties, by means of the component approach. As the main sources of plastic deformation of such connections are due to the components commonly modeled by means of an equivalent T-stub, the prediction of the plastic deformation capacity of bolted T-stubs is of primary importance within the framework of the component approach. Therefore, a theoretical model for predicting the plastic deformation capacity of bolted T-stubs is presented in this paper. The collapse mechanism topologies of bolted T-stubs are analyzed, and the corresponding formulations for predicting the ultimate value of the plastic displacement are given. Although the primary aim of the model is the prediction of the plastic deformation capacity, it can also be used for an approximate evaluation of the whole force-displacement curve. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model, an experimental program has been carried out. The experimental results and the comparison with the theoretical predictions are presented in a companion paper, providing a satisfactory agreement between theoretical results and experimental evidence.

AB - This paper presents the results of an experimental program devoted to the validation of a theoretical model for predicting the ultimate behavior of bolted T-stubs under monotonic loading conditions. Twelve specimens have been tested, under displacement control, to evaluate their plastic deformation supply. The specimens are characterized by different values of the ratio between the flexural resistance of the flanges and the axial resistance of the bolts, covering the whole range of practical design situations. The results from experimental evidence are compared with the force versus displacement curves predicted by means of the theoretical model presented in a companion paper, whose application is presented by means of a worked example. This comparison provides the validation of the proposed theoretical model, whose primary aim is the evaluation of the plastic deformation capacity of the most important component of bolted connections. Finally, by means of the validated theoretical model, the role of the parameters affecting the plastic deformation supply of bolted connections is stressed.

AB - This paper presents an optimum design of longitudinal stiffeners for box-girder compression flanges. The buckling behavior of longitudinally stiffened compression flanges has drawn considerable interest from early pioneers of theoretical mechanics, as illustrated by Timoshenko and Gere and Bleich. The longitudinally stiffened compression plate structural members generally render an economical structure by efficiently proportioning the material to resist the induced compressive stresses. This study presents results that are based on 3D finite-element analysis of several hundred hypothetical compression flange models stiffened by varying numbers of longitudinal stiffeners with realistic dimensions. The thickness of the compression flange t was varied from 0.50 to 2.50 in. (from 12.7 to 63.5 mm), the number of longitudinal stiffeners n was varied from 1 to 4, and the aspect ratio of the plate panel α was varied from 1 to 5. Two different plate transverse slenderness ratios w/t were analyzed. Analytical data were reduced using nonlinear regression analysis to a simplified design equation suitable for practicing engineers. Several example problems are given to illustrate the use of the regression equation. Comparative analyses are also made to demonstrate the versatility and reliability of the analytical study conducted.

AB - This paper addresses the design and behavior of a composite brace system comprised of unbonded steel flat-bar brace embedded in a precast reinforced concrete panel. Debonding material is painted onto the steel flat-bar brace to remove the bond stress between the steel flat-bar brace and the precast concrete panel, so that axial load is applied only on the steel flat-bar brace. The precast concrete panel of a stiffening member is designed to prevent the steel flat-bar brace from buckling in order to effectively mobilize the compressive brace together with the tensile brace during seismic loading. The stiffening requirements to restrain the buckling of the steel flat-bar brace are derived from equilibrium considerations, and are verified by tests. Two types of tests were performed: (1) fundamental buckling tests; and (2) tests of frame with the stiffened brace subjected to the earthquake type of loading. By using the stiffened brace as a hysteretic damper, a designer does not have to consider the complicated postbuckling behavior of steel braces, and can easily control the horizontal stiffness, strength, and energy absorption capacity of steel buildings.
