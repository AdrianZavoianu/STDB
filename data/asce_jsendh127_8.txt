AB - The writers present a simple methodology, developed for use in design assisted by electronic aerodynamic and climatological databases (for short, database-assisted design), that allows a realistic assessment of wind directionality effects. The methodology is applied to typical low-rise industrial steel frame buildings with a rectangular shape in plan, located in hurricane-prone areas, and results are compared with results obtained by the procedure specified in the ASCE 7-98 Standard, which, for buildings, consists of applying a blanket directionality reduction factor Kd = 0.85 to wind effects obtained by disregarding directionality. The results show that, for significant numbers of buildings in hurricane-prone areas, the use of the ASCE procedure can result in the underestimation of wind effects corresponding to strength design. They also show that database-assisted design for wind loads offers the potential for significantly more risk-consistent, safer, and economical design for buildings with both known and unknown orientation.

AB - This paper explores the possibility of incorporating semiactive friction dampers into wind-excited large truss towers to abate excessive vibration. Piezoelectric materials are used to control the clamping force of a friction damper so as to regulate the slip force of the damper through simple feedback of damper motion status. A rational analytical method is then developed for determining wind-induced dynamic response of large truss towers equipped with semiactive friction dampers and performing extensive parametric studies to evaluate their effectiveness. The proposed bimodel method fulfills the task by alternately using a 3D finite-element static model and a 2D lumped mass dynamic model. Finally, the bimodel method and semiactive friction dampers are applied to a large space steel television tower as a case study. The study demonstrates that the bimodel method can efficiently compute wind-induced dynamic response of the television tower with semiactive friction dampers. The semiactive friction dampers can effectively suppress not only excessive displacement response but also velocity and acceleration responses. Compared with passive friction dampers, the semiactive friction dampers are more robust and versatile for enhancing both serviceability and strength performances of the tower.

AB - The wind stability of suspension bridges in the construction phase can often be more problematic than in the final state. In this paper, numerical wind stability analyses are performed for the erection process of both state-of-the-art (the Höga Kusten Bridge) and hypothetical 3,000-m-span box-girder suspension bridges. Measures to improve the wind stability response in the erection phase are discussed. In particular, it is seen that the provision of an eccentric windward mass does not cause any significant improvement on the flutter stability limits for the analyzed case, but the selection of an alternative nonsymmetric erection sequence or the use of stationary aerodynamic appendages are seen to be more effective. Comparatively, assuming that the design wind speed for the construction stage is lower than for the final state, the response of the 3,000-m-span bridge is less problematic in the construction phase than in the final state.

AB - Linear structural analysis is incapable of reflecting the real behavior of a structure under abnormal or ultimate loading conditions. When deformations are large and a structure behaves nonlinearly, the stiffness of the structure changes even if the structural material shows a purely linear elastic behavior, and a geometric nonlinear analysis or a second-order elastic analysis should be performed. However, under severe environmental loading such as strong wind or earthquake, there is a need for a direct second-order inelastic analysis to calculate the ultimate strength capacity and to predict the true behavior of structures. This paper presents and compares two beam-column models, both based upon fiber-type, beam-column elements, for inelastic and large deformation analysis of planar steel structural systems. Derivations of the different stiffness matrices that are used in the new models are presented. Both models have the capacity to account for residual stress consideration. The new model satisfies the rigid-body test, while the second model does not. The accuracy of the two models is compared with benchmark problems via three examples. The results indicate that the new model is more robust and has a faster rate of convergence for problems involving inelastic behavior, high stress, and large deflections.

AB - This paper examines the strength properties of a new timber connector that consists of a sectioned steel tube embedded into the end grain of heavy-timber structural members using a vinyl-ester based mortar. The steel cap of the connector features a threaded hole that allows for the attachment of a variety of connecting steel elements. Connectors were tested in tension and compression in spruce glulam and in tension in parallel strand lumber. Lateral loading tests were performed on single and double connector arrangements with different edge distances and member sizes using spruce glulam members. An additional test series was conducted on specimens exposed to changing climatic environments over a period of 18 weeks prior to tension tests. Results of the tension and compression tests showed a low variation in strength and stiffness. Tension specimens showed an abrupt and brittle failure, indicating the requirement for a more controlled and ductile steel-element failure. Ductile behavior was observed in the compression tests resulting from the deformation characteristics of the wood. In addition, the connection showed a small reduction in strength after the climate cycles. A relationship between edge distance and lateral load capacity was established.

AB - Joints are a matter of crucial importance in any major timber structure. They must have satisfactory strength and stiffness together with reasonable ductility and energy absorption, particularly if designed for use in seismic areas. In joints made with dowels, these requirements may more easily be met if the timber is reinforced locally in the area of the joints and use is made of a hollow cross section in place of a solid cross section for the dowel. Densified veneer wood (DVW) has been found to be a good reinforcing material because of its high embedding strength and its compatibility with timber. In this paper, results obtained from parametric studies made by means of the use of validated numerical models are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DVW reinforcement. The study shows that, even with thin local reinforcement, joints perform significantly better than without it.

AB - A nonlinear finite-element model (LightFrame3D) is presented in this paper to study the performance of 3D timber light-frame buildings under static loading conditions. The uniqueness of the model is the implementation of a mechanics-based representation of the load-deformation characteristics of individual panel-to-frame nail connections in the diaphragm system. This approach requires as input basic material properties and static load-deformation characteristics of the connections. The model can analyze a light-frame building with varied material and structural components and combined loading conditions. Either load control or displacement control can be used as input history. The model was verified and tested by theoretical and experimental means and good agreements were achieved. The model can provide information on the hysteresis behavior of structures under cyclic loading and the torsional response of eccentric 3D buildings.

AB - This paper presents a novel approach to the modeling of failure of finger-joints in glued-laminated beams. A nonlinear strain-softening model with stochastic material parameters was used to characterize the failure zone of the finger-joint. Monte Carlo simulations of the behavior of laminations with finger-joints and of laminated beams were performed using the finite-element method. Various lamination thicknesses and beam depths were investigated, as well as the effect of varying the ductility of the finger-joint. Finally, the use of simplified finger-joint material models was also investigated. The results show that the proposed approach can account for such phenomena as the size effect and the laminating effect. Another observation is that the finger-joint ductility has a major influence on the lamination and beam strength, and that a special case of the present modeling approach can be made to coincide with the classic weakest link theory of Weibull.

AB - A new failure surface and criterion are developed for prismatic reinforced concrete structural elements subjected to biaxial bending and axial load. The failure criterion is a smooth surface in 3D space (two moments and axial load). It is governed by eight parameters, four of which are strengths that can be computed directly from strain-based failure criteria. The remaining four are exponential coefficients whose values are calculated using optimization techniques. Since the failure criterion is intended for use in automated design-optimization procedures, methods for parameter estimation based on design of the RC structural element are developed and tested. The parameters of the proposed surface are calculated first by simply minimizing approximation errors and then by allowing only conservative approximation errors. A conclusion of this work is that the proposed methods are reliable and can be used to rapidly check allowable capacity constraints in load space during design optimization of reinforced concrete structures undergoing dynamic loading.

AB - This work was initiated to study the influence of geometry and material variations on the structural response of an aluminum I-beam subjected to concentrated loading. The beam behavior was computed with a previously validated LS-DYNA model, and an analytical response surface expression for the maximum load capacity was established. The deviation between the response surface estimate and the numerical analysis result was within 1.1%, and &lt;0.35% in the most interesting parameter range. The probability distributions of all the material parameters, the thicknesses, and the geometrical imperfections were established on measurements from former works, and the code PROBAN was used to evaluate the influence of variability in the model parameters. It was found practical to separate two different cases: (1) one reflecting the variation occurring in a certain extrusion; and (2) the other indicating the scatter in a random batch. The first case was shown to give 20% higher design capacity indicating that it may be attractive to improve the control of the production process.

AB - This paper emphasizes the discrepancies in conventional methods of analyzing nonprismatic members having T-sections. In practice, the change in the location of the centroidal axis over the length of nonprismatic members is ignored in structural analysis. Commonly used Portland Cement Association tables for fixed-end moment and stiffness factors are based on the assumptions of a straight-line centroidal axis and variable rectangular cross section. However, discontinuities in the centroidal axis produce strong coupling between the end moments and horizontal thrust. Nonprismatic members behave similar to an arch, and this creates an axial force that is neglected in conventional methods. Moreover, beams are considered as T-beams in the structural models because of the effect of RC slabs. Consequently, nonprismatic T-sections require special consideration in structural analysis. The purpose of this paper is to present the behavior of nonprismatic T-section beams based on a 3D finite-element investigation. Based on the results of parametric studies, a simple, practical 2D beam model with an effective length concept is proposed for the analysis of nonprismatic members having T-sections. In the proposed model, the effective length of the 2D beam element representing the haunch evolves as 75% of its actual length. It is concluded that the deviation in results from the results of the finite-element analysis is within 15%. Additionally, different modeling schemes in the analysis of frames with nonprismatic members using the proposed 2D beam representation are investigated.

AB - Reliability-based structural optimization (RBSO) considering probability distributions of random variables pertaining to load and strength parameters and satisfying system level reliability requirements is essential for optimization of practical structures. The computational and modeling complexities in RBSO using system level reliability constraints and the limitations of mathematical programming techniques are briefly discussed. The assessment of system reliability of real structures by the failure mode approach leads to numerous failure modes and requires complex modeling. A modified branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed to perform the system reliability assessment of discrete structures by failure-mode approach, and its computational efficiency in the optimization process is illustrated. Genetic algorithm based methodology for reliability-based configuration optimization of trusses is proposed, which satisfactorily addresses the computational and convergence problems. It is concluded that genetic algorithm based RBSO of trusses treating member sizes and configuration as design variables provides better optimal solutions for practical structures.

AB - In this paper, a comprehensive approach is developed to integrate computational reliability methods and nondestructive inspection (NDI) for fatigue reliability evaluation. Uncertainties existing in the performance and outcome of NDI are considered through numerical statistical measures, and the mathematical relationships among these measures are derived. A new method is proposed to estimate the probability of detection (POD) and confidence interval using these relationships. Also, a new method of using the NDI results to update the reliability estimation is presented, which accounts for POD, measurement accuracy, false call probability, and the probability that a very large flaw may not be detected. The application of the proposed methods is illustrated through an example fatigue problem and inspection techniques with different POD characteristics are compared.

The development of the model is quite general, allowing the easy incorporation of material nonlinearity and nonlinear load-slip response of wood-concrete connectors. An effective numerical algorithm is developed and implemented for solving the governing integral and differential equations, which relies on Newton's method and a single level of iteration. The model is verified through comparison with published experimental data on the bending response of partially composite wood-concrete beams.
