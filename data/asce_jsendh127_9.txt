AB - This paper and a companion paper present a complete study (analysis, modeling, and numerical simulation) of the wind pressure field on prismatic tall buildings, taking into account its non-Gaussian nature. In this paper, the analysis of the data obtained by wind tunnel experimental tests is used to provide a systematic characterization of the stochastic pressure field. First, the experimental work is briefly described; then the wind pressure statistical moments up to the second order (mean, standard deviation, and spectral densities) are obtained. Comparisons with results reported in the literature are used to validate the reliability of the experimental measurements. Histograms of the experimental data in the separated flow regions (vortex shedding and wake) are used to identify the non-Gaussian nature of the pressure fluctuations. Maps of higher-order statistical moments (skewness and kurtosis coefficients) at the four faces of the model are proposed to obtain an easy tool to localize regions with non-Gaussian features and give a measurement of the non-Gaussianity. The influence of the incoming flow direction on the parameters of interest is also considered.

AB - The present study is the logical successor to a preceding paper where the nature of wind pressures on a tall building was investigated by wind tunnel experimental tests. The statistical analysis showed that the pressure time series recorded in separated flow regions have significant non-Gaussian features. The results of this experimental work are used here to develop a suitable procedure to simulate the wind pressure time series on prismatic buildings. This procedure is based on translation processes. It is shown that the proposed method is very attractive for simulation based on experimental data because the translation processes are completely characterized by marginal distributions and covariance functions, which can be easily estimated. The obtained results show that a very high accuracy is achieved. The efficiency of the proposed procedure is related to the exact calculation of the covariance function and the complete utilization of the information given by the marginal distribution. Moreover, time-consuming procedures are avoided.

AB - Ground motion records obtained from sites at known locations relative to earthquake faults were used to study near-fault (NF) ground shaking effects on the inelastic response of simple structures. The structures were idealized as single-degree-of-freedom oscillators with periods ranging from 0.05 to 3.0 s, a damping ratio of 2%, and target ductilities of 2, 4, and 6. The severity of inelastic response was described by a relationship between the oscillator period, the target ductility, and the lateral force reduction factor obtained from analysis. It was found that the inelastic demands of medium and longer period oscillators responding to NF strike-normal shaking increased for sites close to the fault as the distance along the fault from the epicenter increased. The inelastic response of short-period oscillators was not affected as much by NF shaking. A methodology for obtaining average and design level demands for structures at specific locations relative to the epicenter and fault is described. A design example is provided.

AB - Two recently proposed and closely related approximate methods to estimate the maximum lateral inelastic deformations demands of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems subjected to earthquake ground motions are investigated. In both methods, maximum inelastic displacements are estimated from maximum elastic displacements through the use of parameters that relate the response of elastic and inelastic SDOF systems. In the first method, the maximum inelastic displacement is estimated from the maximum elastic displacement through mean strength reduction factors derived from statistical studies. In the second method, the maximum inelastic displacement is estimated from the maximum elastic displacement through inelastic displacement ratios also derived from statistical studies. It is shown that the first method is actually a first-order approximation of the second method and that only in the absence of variability the two methods provide the same result. Furthermore, it is shown that the systematic error introduced by the first method leads to underestimations of maximum inelastic displacement demands. The error is evaluated and examples using results from statistical results of the seismic response of SDOF systems are presented.

AB - Inelastic response spectra may be estimated by dividing elastic response spectra by R-factors derived from the response to a simple pulse. The pulse R-factor depends on the pulse shape, ductility (μ), and load-deformation model and the period of the system (T) relative to the characteristic period of the pulse (Tp). Inelastic spectra estimated using pulse R-factors are compared with those obtained using other contemporary R–μ–T relationships for elastoplastic, bilinear, and stiffness-degrading single-degree-of-freedom systems. Strong motion records used in this study consist of short- and long-duration records as well as near-fault records having forward directivity features. The accuracy of the estimates is influenced by the characteristic period of the ground motion and the presence of soft soil deposits that lead to nearly harmonic surface waveforms. Pulse R-factors are found to be slightly better than the R–μ–T relations determined by other investigators. Because the pulse R-factors are defined implicitly by the specification of the pulse shape, they may be useful for a variety of load-deformation models and hysteretic relationships.

AB - A statistical study was performed to evaluate the cyclic instability of steel moment connections with reduced beam sections (RBS). Based on test results of 55 full-scale specimens, regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationships between response quantities (plastic rotation capacity and strength degradation rate) and slenderness parameters for buckling. Regressions analyses performed on a linear and a nonlinear model showed that the response quantities are highly dependent on the slenderness ratio of web local buckling, not lateral-torsional buckling. Relationships between the response quantities and the slenderness ratios for both web and flange local buckling modes were developed. For a target plastic rotation capacity, the limiting width-thickness ratio of web local buckling for seismic design is presented. An investigation of the concrete slab effect showed that it would increase both the strength and plastic rotation capacity of the RBS beams under positive bending. Under negative bending, however, the slab only enhanced the plastic rotation capacity slightly, implying that the slab cannot be counted on to brace the beam bottom flange.

AB - This paper describes the analytical modeling and a seismic design procedure for steel moment connections with a welded straight haunch. Recent test results showed that welding a straight haunch beneath the beam could be a viable solution for repair and rehabilitation of pre-Northridge moment connections and also new construction. Although a design procedure for the connection with a triangular welded haunch has been developed recently, it is not applicable for the straight haunch moment connection because the force transfer mechanism is different. Based on the finite-element analysis results, a simplified analytical model that considers the force interaction and deformation compatibility between the beam and haunch is developed. A design procedure as well as details that minimize the stress concentration at the haunch tip is also recommended.

AB - The results of a 3D finite-element study of the inelastic behavior of unreinforced, flange-welded moment connections in steel seismic moment resisting frames is presented. Computer models of connection subassemblies with notch tough weld metal were developed using the general-purpose computer program ABAQUS. Several issues were addressed in the study: (1) geometry and size of the weld access hole; (2) control of inelastic panel zone deformation; and (3) benefit of a welded beam web. The analytical results provided information on basic performance and the effects of these parameters on inelastic performance, thereby furthering the current understanding of welded connection behavior under seismic loading. Based on the results, recommendations for the seismic design of connections are given. The recommendations include using a groove welded beam web attachment with supplemental fillet welds along the edges of the shear tab and a modified weld access hole geometry. The results indicate that a strong panel zone enhances inelastic connection performance, suggesting that they be used in design. The incorporation of the recommendations into a test program showed good connection ductility in the test specimens.

AB - Damage and stability assessment techniques are developed for evaluating the seismic performance of composite steel-concrete moment frames. The approach features a new seismic damage index based on cumulative member ductility that employs the concept of primary and follower load cycles to distinguish loading history effects. Equations are presented to determine the limiting rotation capacity for RC columns, steel and composite beams, and composite steel-concrete connection subassemblages, and the resulting damage model is validated by comparisons with published test data. The damage index is incorporated in a methodology that combines nonlinear time history and gravity load stability analyses to evaluate collapse prevention performance as a function of earthquake ground motion intensity. In contrast to existing seismic assessment procedures, the proposed methodology integrates the destabilizing effects of local damage indices to evaluate overall system response. The assessment technique is illustrated through a trial design study of a six-story frame conducted under Phase 5 of the U.S.–Japan Cooperative Research Program on composite and hybrid structures.

AB - Effects of a tuned mass damper on the modal responses of a six-story building structure are studied first to demonstrate the damper's ineffectiveness in seismic applications. Multistage and multimode tuned mass dampers are then introduced. Several optimal location indices are defined based on intuitive reasoning, and a sequential procedure is proposed for practical design and placement of the dampers in seismically excited building structures. The proposed procedure is applied to place the dampers on the floors of the six-story building for maximum reduction of the accelerations under a stochastic seismic load and 13 earthquake records. Numerical results show that the multiple dampers can effectively reduce the acceleration of the uncontrolled structure by 10–25% more than a single damper. Time-history analyses indicate that the multiple dampers weighing 3% of total structural weight can reduce the floor acceleration up to 40%. The multiple dampers can even suppress the peak of acceleration responses due to impulsive excitations, which a single damper of equal mass cannot achieve.

AB - The base-isolated Fire Command and Control (FCC) building in Los Angeles experienced strong motion during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program has instrumented the building and recorded the data during the Northridge earthquake; these data are available for performance evaluation. Impact was observed in the base-isolated FCC building during the Northridge earthquake. The objective of this study is to evaluate the seismic performance of the base-isolated FCC building during the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the effect of impact. New analytical modeling techniques are developed to analyze the base-isolated FCC building with impact and are verified using system identification. The response computed, using the developed analytical modeling techniques, is verified using recorded data. The response with and without impact is presented. The effects of impact on the structural response are evaluated. The seismic performance evaluations, comparing the response of the base-isolated building with the response if the building were fixed base, are presented. It is shown that the seismic performance of the FCC building in the Northridge earthquake was satisfactory, except for increased shear and drift due to impact. Impact should be avoided in base-isolated structures as it can cause damage.

AB - The strut-and-tie method is a promising analytical tool for the design of disturbed regions where the conventional plane bending theory does not hold. These include pile caps, corbels, frame joints, deep beams, and so forth. This paper focuses on the application of a strut-and-tie model to prestressed deep beams. A simple and direct model is proposed, taking the prestressing effect into consideration. The model can be used for both pre- and posttensioned deep beams. Different configurations of web reinforcement can also be properly modeled in the proposed approach. A comparison shows that the predictions are in good agreement with experimental results of four case studies of 39 beams.

AB - The discrete crack approach, which has been extensively used for analyzing single cracks, is extended for the numerical analysis of multiple cracks, based on the fictitious crack model and the crack-tip-controlled numerical algorithm. Assuming each crack as an effective crack while restraining the growth of others in turn, an explicit formulation of the mode I type crack propagation for multiple cracks is presented, and a minimum load criterion for crack extension is proposed for its numerical implementation. By eliminating invalid solutions to ensure proper crack behavior, this numerical model is capable of producing a variety of crack propagation patterns. Furthermore, a numerical technique based on the incremental stress analysis is introduced, which replaces the commonly adopted total strain approach for the discrete modeling of single cracks. The accuracy and effectiveness of this numerical method in analyzing multiple-crack problems are demonstrated through a series of parametric studies on four-point bending tests of simple plain concrete beams, as well as an experimental verification with fracture tests on real-size tunnel specimens.

AB - Predicting behavior of plastic hinges subjected to large inelastic deformations caused by extreme loads such as earthquakes plays an important role in assessing maximum stable deformation capacities of framed concrete structures. This paper presents an analytical procedure that can be used to predict the behavior of plastic hinges in reinforced concrete columns. Since the behavior of plastic hinges in concrete columns is a 3D problem, the plastic hinge analysis technique considers equilibrium, compatibility, and constitutive relations in 3D space. Complex behavioral phenomena such as softening of longitudinal bars due to inelastic buckling and reinforcing cage-concrete core interaction are incorporated in the analysis. To establish a constitutive relationship for reinforcing bars under axial compression an experimental study on 56 reinforcing bar specimens having unsupported length to bar diameter ratios ranging between 4 and 10 was conducted, and results are reported herein. Finally, the suggested analytical procedure is compared with conventional analysis techniques by predicting the sectional response of concrete column specimens. It is concluded that through the use of the analytical procedure presented here it was possible to obtain realistic estimations for the maximum deformation capacities of the plastic hinge regions of the specimens that were tested under constant axial loads and reversed cyclic displacement excursions. The concrete core-reinforcing cage interaction, which caused outward deflections in longitudinal bars, did not only reduce the ductility of longitudinal bars under compression but also reduced the maximum stress that the bars were able to achieve.

AB - A new analysis method for unreinforced masonry double wythe walls is developed and presented in this paper. The technique uses empirical formulas for the effective flexural rigidity of a masonry wall as obtained from a finite-element analysis of a masonry couplet. These formulas, together with equations that relate the moments in the block and brick wythes and the ties, are used in a 1D analysis of the masonry wall. The method rationally accounts for material nonlinearities, flexural tensile bond failure mechanism, type of ties, cavity width, load eccentricity, slenderness ratio, P-delta, and moisture and temperature deformation effects. The simplicity of the analysis technique is illustrated by instituting the procedure into a spreadsheet application. Complete load-deflection curves generated for some test walls compared well with the experimental data. The analysis method is accurate and extendable in predicting the ultimate load and the load-deflection relationships of masonry walls.

AB - The purpose of the present paper is to propose a method to give a more accurate prediction of time-dependent prestress force changes due to creep and shrinkage of concrete in prestressed concrete (PSC) structures. Updating of long-term prediction of prestress forces is achieved using Bayesian statistical inference. By Bayesian statistics, prior predictions of time-dependent effects due to creep and shrinkage of concrete are used with the information obtained from in-site measurements to develop updated predictions, or posterior predictions. The prior prediction contains the uncertainties with regard to creep and shrinkage of concrete. The present study also deals with the uncertainties in the long-term prediction of creep and shrinkage effects using a sampling method. The proposed theory is applied to long-term prediction of prestress forces of an actual PSC box girder bridge. The present study indicates that the width of mean ± two standard deviation for posterior predictions of prestress forces with nine measurement information is about half that of mean ± two standard deviation for prior predictions of prestress forces. Therefore, the present numerical results prove that a more accurate long-term prediction of prestress force changes in PSC structures due to creep and shrinkage of concrete can be achieved by employing the proposed method.
