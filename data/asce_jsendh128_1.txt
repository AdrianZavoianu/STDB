AB - Elastomeric isolation bearings are required to be stable at high shear strains, which occur during strong earthquakes. Hence, rigorous determination of the critical axial load during design is important. Currently, the critical load is determined using the small displacement Haringx theory and modified to account for large shear strains by an approximate correction factor. The objective of this study is to experimentally determine the effect of horizontal displacement or shear strain on critical load and to study the validity of the approximate correction factor. Experiments were conducted on a series of elastomeric bearings with low shape factors. Test procedure and test results are presented in detail. It is shown that the critical load decreases with increasing horizontal displacement or shear strain. It is also shown that substantial critical load capacity exists at a horizontal displacement equal to the width of the bearing and is not zero, as predicted by the correction factor. It is further shown that the approximate formula is not conservative at smaller displacements and overly conservative at larger displacements. The critical loads obtained from experiments are compared with results from finite element analyses and nonlinear analytical solutions; the comparisons indicate that the effect of large horizontal displacements on the critical load can be reliably predicted.

AB - An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the effect of power actuated fasteners (PAFs) on the net section fracture strength of steel tension members. An extensive series of steel coupons were tested under tension loads. Coupons were provided either with PAFs or with drilled holes with the same diameter as the PAFs. The objective of this study was to determine if current specification rules for computing the net area of tension members with bolt holes could be applied to members with PAFs. The coupons tested with PAFs exhibited consistently higher net section efficiencies than coupons with drilled holes. These results indicate that installing a PAF into a tension member has less effect on the member’s net section fracture strength than a drilled hole. Design recommendations are provided for computing the net area of steel tension members with PAFs.

AB - Thin-walled tubular sections (t&lt;4 mm) are increasingly being used in the road transportation industry and agricultural industry for applications such as lighting poles, traffic sign supports, truck trailers, swing-ploughs, haymakers, and linkage graders. These structures are subjected to fatigue loading and some failures have been observed. Both the International Institute of Welding and International Committee for the Development and Study of Tubular Construction fatigue guides for welded tubular joints apply only to tubes with a thickness above 4 mm. This paper deals with the fatigue design of tube-to-plate T joints under cyclic in-plane bending using the classification method. Forty-eight specimens, made up by welding a square hollow section tube (t&lt;4 mm) to a plate, are fatigue tested. The effects of in-line galvanizing, steel grade, stress ratio, and tube wall thickness on the fatigue life of these joints are investigated. The design stress range-to-number of cycles (S-N) curves, derived from the least squares method of analysis, show that the S-N curves for the tube-to-plate joints lie above the existing S-N curves in the Australian, European, and Canadian standards.

AB - Recent trends in building construction have highlighted the need for improved methodologies for engineering new light-frame structures for housing and techniques for condition assessment of existing structures. The aftermath of natural disasters during the past decade, the rapid evolution of design and construction methods, and heightened expectations on the part of the public and its scrutiny of perceived and actual deficiencies in codes and code enforcement have further underscored these needs. Among the high-priority areas identified at a 1997 ASCE workshop on wood engineering research needs were behavior and performance of wood structural systems; criteria for performance assessment; and methods for condition assessment of damaged systems following natural disasters. The development of appropriate and usable fragility models and system reliability analysis tools is necessary to meet these needs and to make meaningful advances in performance-based engineering of wood frame structures. This paper provides an overview of efforts to develop such models and tools, and suggests a possible methodology for assessing probable response of light-frame residential construction exposed to various levels of natural and man-made hazards. The implementation of performance-based engineering for residential construction will enhance durability and reduce maintenance costs of the nation’s housing inventory, and will facilitate reductions in risk of death, injury, and property damage from extreme natural hazards such as earthquakes and hurricanes.

AB - An important advancement in structural engineering in recent years has been the development of performance-based seismic design. However, its application to engineered wood framed buildings remains largely unexplored. This paper discusses the application of performance-based seismic design to wood framed buildings through a direct-displacement methodology. In the first part of the paper, limitations of the current force-based seismic design procedure for wood framed buildings are outlined. Thereafter, the fundamentals of displacement-based seismic design are presented along with a description of the system parameters required for its application. For the purpose of evaluating these parameters for wood framed buildings, a simple numerical model capable of predicting the cyclic response and energy dissipation characteristics of wood shear walls under general quasi-static cyclic loading is presented. The generalization of this model to three-dimensional wood framed structures is also discussed. As an application example, the displacement-based seismic design of a simple one-story shear wall building is presented. In turn, this design approach is validated by nonlinear dynamic time-history analyses using earthquake records representative of the hazard levels that were associated with the design performance levels.

AB - International practice for load and resistance factor design (LRFD) of mechanical structural timber joints is reviewed. Attention is on design provisions in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia, those being locations where LRFD codes for wood construction exist. There are broad similarities between various codes, in that all countries adopt an element-based approach to design. Most codes base capacity design checks for joints with dowel-type fasteners on the so-called European yield model. There are a number of systematic differences in detailed implementation of LRFD concepts between countries. No country has yet used structural reliability concepts in derivation and/or calibration of design equations for joints as the level of safety cannot be formally assessed except for relatively simple problems. This contrasts with the situation for members, as several countries have already implemented reliability concepts in design of wood members. Thus, there is imbalance in the principles of design for members and joint in timber systems. Suggestions are made regarding actions necessary to place member and joint design on an equal footing.

AB - Seismic performance of rectangular hollow bridge columns is a significant issue for a high-speed rail project in Taiwan because ductility of these columns varies with the type of lateral reinforcement. In this paper two prototypes and four models of such columns were tested under a constant axial load and a pseudo-static, cyclically reversed horizontal load. Effects of ductility and dissipated energy are investigated. An analytical model is developed to predict the moment-curvature relationship of each section and the load-displacement relationship of the columns. Based on test results, seismic performance of the columns is presented. Test results are also compared to those from the proposed analytical model. Ductility factors of the tested specimens range from 3.45 to 11.1, and the analytical model satisfactorily predicts the load-displacement relationship of such columns with acceptable accuracy.

AB - Near-field earthquake ground motions may contain distinctive coherent velocity pulses. Strong ground motions with such large velocity pulses can be damaging to structures located within the near-field region. A class of semiactive control algorithms referred to as active interaction control (AIC) have been developed as a means of suppressing the vibration of building structures during moderate to large earthquakes. Modal response-based AIC control approaches have been shown to be effective in suppressing the vibrations of building structures subjected to far-field ground motions in previous studies. Unlike the resonant modelike response of structures subjected to more randomlike far-field ground motion, it is believed that a wave propagation behavior will control the structural response at least for the first few cycles of reflection under the action of near-field ground motions with coherent velocity pulses. To verify the effectiveness of the AIC control approaches in the case of near-field ground motions, a numerical simulation for a 20-story steel-framed building subjected to a sample of near-field ground motions, has been performed and the results are presented in this paper.

AB - The paper shows that the excessive value of the dead load factor in the ultimate load requirements of the current structural design code implies a size effect. The size effect implied, however, does not have a rational form; it cannot distinguish among various types of failure in which very different size effects apply. This size effect partly compensates for the absence of the actual size effect, primarily the size effect due to energy release, from the current code specifications. Therefore, it would be dangerous to reduce the dead load factor without simultaneously introducing size effect provisions into the code. The question of a possible reduction in the dead load factor cannot be separated from the question of size effect, and so the fracture experts and reliability experts must collaborate. Further it is shown that a possible size effect is hidden in a reliability-based code due to the fact that the reliability implied in the code increases with the contribution of the dead load effect to the overall gravity load effect. The overreliability ratio defined in this study may be used to quantify the additional size effect that can be hidden in a reliability-based code.

AB - The change of modal characteristics directly provides an indication of structural damage. Based on changes in frequencies and mode shapes of vibration, a damage identification technique is proposed in this paper for predicting damage location and severity. The method is applied at an element level with a conventional finite-element model. The element damage equations have been established through the eigenvalue equations that characterize the dynamic behavior. Several solution techniques are discussed and compared. The influence of simulated noise in the modal data is also presented. The method has been verified by a number of damage scenarios for simulated beams and has found the exact location and severity of damage. It is demonstrated that multiplying the damaged eigenvalue equations with the undamaged or damaged mode shapes provides more equations and guarantees the damage localization. The resulting equations, however, become more sensitive to the deviation of modal data and the direct solution often yields poor results. Numerical results show that the non-negative least-squares method can lead to satisfactory results in most cases. A regularization algorithm with error-based truncation is necessary to ensure the right solutions.

AB - Most of the mode-based damage identification techniques have been well verified by numerical simulations. However, many of them still face problems when applied to real measurements where noise is present. In this paper, an experimental program of a reinforced concrete beam is aimed to establish the relation between damage and changes of the structural dynamic characteristics. A damage identification scheme is developed using the mode-based damage identification method described in an accompany paper. The proposed damage identification scheme is applied to the experimental data and the consequent results are compared. It is demonstrated that the proposal of a realistic damage pattern that can describe damage by few representative parameters is necessary to guarantee the localization of damage. An adaptation of the initial finite-element model is required to give the best agreement with the reference measurements. A possible advantage of the algorithm is that the modal forces can be directly extracted from any finite-element package and the mode shape expansion is involved in the damage identification scheme using a static recovery technique.

AB - A finite element formulation for the analysis of two-dimensional steel frames either at ambient or elevated temperature is presented. The formulation includes both geometric and material nonlinearities, and a creep model. A new feature is the manner in which strain reversal is incorporated into the program. The program can analyze steel frames subjected either to (1) increasing external loads at ambient temperature or, (2) constant external loads at elevated temperatures. The program then gives predictions of (1) a collapse load or (2) critical temperature, whichever the case may be. This program has been applied to a number of experimental and analytical benchmark tests. Excellent agreement has been obtained in all these cases. Following on these benchmark tests, creep effects on the buckling of heated columns have also been studied. It shows that creep generally starts to be dominant beyond 400°C. In connection to this, the current simplified method for calculating the critical temperature in Eurocode 3 Pt. 1.2 is shown to be unsafe for columns with intermediate slenderness ratio under both uniform heating and nonuniform heating.

AB - Self-drilling screws are the primary means of fastening cold-formed steel members in residential construction. Because the fabrication of connections is the most labor intensive aspect of the construction process, a better understanding of the behavior of screw connections could lead to more optimum connection design. Therefore studies have been performed at the University of Missouri-Rolla aimed at developing a better understanding of the behavior of single-shear connections using self-drilling screws in cold-formed steel construction. The study’s focus was on design parameters typically employed in residential construction. Fastener patterns, screw spacing, stripped screws, and the number of screws in a connection was varied to determine their influence on connection strength. A design equation was established.

AB - The ISO Draft Code for offshore structures has included a formulation for the design of both gap and overlapped tubular K joints under axial loading. The formulation has been derived from a test database of 149 gap joints and 56 overlapped joints. The authors have also presented, in a series of recent articles, a strength formulation (Swansea formulation) for overlapped K joints, based on a database of joint strength generated by an extensive parametric finite element study. In this paper, the accuracy of these two formulations is assessed using the joints with equal brace inclination contained in both the test and the finite element databases. The results of the comparison show that, while the Swansea formulation can accurately back-predict the test data, the ISO formulation underpredicts the finite element data by an average of 13% and its performance is particularly poor for joints with low γ and medium to low β. With the view that the Swansea formulation may be adopted to replace that proposed by ISO for design practice, the numerical constants in the Swansea formulation were simplified and a mean bias factor was derived to convert it to the characteristic format.

AB - An analytical method has been developed to calculate the deformations and stresses of the wall plates of dry gas holders subject to gas pressure. The deformations of the wall plates are decomposed into out-plane bending and in-plane deformation which are analyzed with the theories for orthotropic plates and flat plates under plane stress, respectively. The analytical formulas to calculate the deformations and stresses in the wall plates are obtained. They give very agreeable results to those of finite-element analysis. Due to the simplicity of the proposed method, it is especially suitable for the analysis and design of the wall plates of dry gas holders under gas pressure.

AB - The purpose of this article is to describe a tool developed in order to equip a finite-element software based on nonlinear beam analysis with an error indicator aimed at measuring discretization errors. The technique is an extension of the error estimate devised by Ladevèze et al. in 1991 in which the finite-element solution is compared to a statically admissible distribution of the generalized stresses. This last distribution is built element by element which is fast and easy to implement. A nonlinear analysis of a single bay frame in static’s is presented as an example.
