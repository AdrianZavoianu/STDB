AB - There is considerable uncertainty regarding both the timing and contributions of various individuals to the development of reinforced concrete flat slabs in the United States. The work of George M. Hill and the patent of Orlando W. Norcross are discussed first to provide context. The significant achievements of Claude A. P. Turner from 1905 to the end of 1909 are then described. Turner’s conceptual design of flat slabs is discussed. Turner conceived a cage of reinforcement, which he called the “mushroom head,” as shear reinforcement. Turner’s simple design for moment led to very small areas of steel flexural reinforcement, which drew criticism from structural engineers. Some early flat-slab buildings and bridges and the load tests that Turner performed are discussed. A tangible symbol of Turner’s contributions is his extant 1906 Hoffman (a.k.a. Marshall) building, which was designated an ASCE National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2002. The dispiriting history of flat-slab development after the end of 1909 is briefly discussed.

AB - The main aim of this study is to propose a simple and reliable method to predict the buckling length of longitudinal reinforcing bars and also to predict the spalling of cover concrete in reinforced concrete members. Stability analysis is conducted giving due consideration to both geometrical and mechanical properties of the longitudinal reinforcing bars and lateral ties. The tie stiffness required to hold longitudinal reinforcing bars in different buckling modes is derived from energy principles, and it is compared with actual tie stiffness to determine the stable buckling mode. The buckling length is computed as the product of the stable buckling mode and the tie spacing. The proposed buckling length determination method is experimentally verified for various cases. A design method for lateral ties to avoid buckling-induced strength degradation is also recommended. The effect of lateral deformation of longitudinal bars is quantitatively evaluated and incorporated in the simulation of cover concrete spalling. Analytical prediction considering spalling and buckling according to the proposed methods showed better agreement with the experimental result.

AB - The average stress condition in a reinforced concrete (RC) element is not identical to the local stress condition at a crack because of bond slip between the concrete and the reinforcement. After a review of previous research concerning local stresses at cracks, this paper presents local equilibrium and compatibility equations for RC elements given constitutive models for bond and friction. A procedure is described for analyzing the in-plane pure shear response of orthogonally reinforced concrete panels. The procedure considers stress variations between cracks, the crack formation process, and the slip δt accompanying the friction across a crack. Corresponding analytical results are compared with previous experimental work. It is shown that after the residual tension at the crack is lost, the slip δt increases almost proportionally to the normal crack displacement δn. Accompanying local shears τct remain because of friction even when the normal crack displacement continues to increase.

AB - This paper discusses the design and modeling of a lateral load resisting system comprised of reinforced concrete walls coupled by steel beams i.e., hybrid coupled walls. A number of prototype systems with various levels of coupling are proportioned according to a proposed design method that ensures that a specific degree of coupling is achieved. Detailed finite-element models are created to study the pushover response of the designed prototype systems. The developed models account for the effect of material inelasticity, concrete cracking, opening and closure of the gap between the embedded steel beams and the walls, and geometric nonlinearity. The developed finite-element models are validated through comparisons with test results of a number of reinforced concrete walls and wall-beam subassemblages. Various performance measures are proposed to judge and compare the behavior of the various systems. The behavior of the systems and comparisons between their performance under pushover loading are discussed in a companion paper.

AB - Presented are the results of nonlinear pushover analyses of the hybrid coupled wall (HCW) prototypes designed and discussed in a companion paper. The objectives of the analyses are (1) to study the effect of the coupling ratio on system response; and (2) to evaluate existing design guidelines for HCWs. The discussion addresses target displacements, displacement profile, base shear, wall reactions, story drifts over the height, wall plastic rotations, shear distortions, coupling beam rotations, wall-beam connection response, crack patterns, concrete crushing at critical locations, and system overstrength. The suitability of HCWs for use in regions of high seismic risk is discussed.

AB - This paper discusses the nonlinear load-deformation behavior of coupling beam subassemblages in a new type of hybrid coupled wall system for seismic regions. Coupling of concrete walls is achieved by posttensioning steel beams to the walls using unbonded posttensioning tendons. Different from conventional hybrid coupled wall systems, the coupling beams of the new system are not embedded into the walls. One of the most important advantages of the new system is that it can be used to couple existing walls as a part of a strengthening and retrofit scheme. This paper describes an analytical investigation of the nonlinear behavior of coupled wall subassemblages that include a coupling beam and the adjacent wall regions at a floor level. The effect of structural design parameters such as the amount of posttensioning, beam properties, and wall properties on the behavior of the subassemblages, including the amount of coupling, energy dissipation, and deformation capacity is investigated. A simple design method to estimate the nonlinear load-deformation behavior of the subassemblages is developed. The investigation is based on an analytical model using fiber elements, which is verified by comparing with a finite element model. The results indicate that unbonded posttensioned steel coupling beams with initial stiffness similar to embedded steel beams can be designed to provide stable levels of coupling without experiencing significant damage over large nonlinear cyclic deformations. The amount of coupling between the walls can be controlled by changing the posttensioning force.

AB - This paper presents an analytical study of the lateral–torsional instability and lateral bracing effects of wide-flange steel beams subjected to cyclic loading. Numerical analysis using the large deformation theory was conducted to collect the necessary data. Examined were wide-flange steel beams bent in double curvature and subjected to cyclic loading with increasing amplitudes up to the maximum beam end rotation of 0.045 rad. Cross-sectional properties, slenderness ratios, material strength, loading history, and unbraced length were chosen as analysis variables. The lateral instability effect was found to differ significantly between cyclic and monotonic loading. For slenderness ratios about the weak axis not smaller than 100, the strength that can be sustained under cyclic loading was much smaller than that obtained under monotonic loading due to the accumulation of out-of-plane deformations. Equations are proposed for the beam unbraced length with which no detrimental reduction in strength is present in cyclic loading up to the maximum beam end rotation of 0.045 rad. It was also found that the unbraced length requirements stipulated in the American Institute of Steel Construction Seismic Provisions are a reasonably conservative measure to ensure sufficient beam rotation capacity. Lateral instability of reduced beam section (RBS) beams was also analyzed. It is notable that the RBS beam is not necessarily more susceptible to lateral instability than the corresponding standard beam, primarily because of a smaller yielding region and smaller forces induced in the cross section of the RBS beam. This phenomenon was interpreted using a simple flange buckling analogy. The lateral bracing requirements stipulated for standard beams are applicable to ensure sufficient rotation capacity for RBS beams if local buckling effects would not occur.

AB - Geometrically nonlinear analyses are used to study the static structural behavior of three cable systems. All analyses and results are nondimensional and therefore valid for any scale. The behavior of a system that has a singular linear stiffness matrix is compared to that of a comparable system that has a nonsingular linear stiffness matrix. The actions considered include pretensioning, uniform dead load, asymmetric and antisymmetric vertical live loads and moving vertical live loads. There is no distinct improved static behavior associated with the system that has a nonsingular linear stiffness matrix. The nonlinear behavior of a cable stiffened by a girder is also studied. The behavior of the deck-stiffened system depends strongly on a nondimensional parameter defined by the moment of inertia of the girder divided by the area of the suspension cable times the square of its sag. A preliminary comparison of the relative effectiveness of stiffening with a girder versus stiffening by longitudinal pretensioning is made.

AB - Snow drifts are frequently observed at roof steps, that is, at the common wall between two nominally flat roof surfaces at different elevations. When wind blows from the lower roof towards the upper roof, some of the snow on the lower roof is transported towards and settles at the roof step, resulting in a windward roof step drift on the lower-level roof. When wind blows from the upper roof towards the lower roof, some of the snow on the upper roof settles on the lower roof adjacent to the roof step, resulting in a leeward roof step drift on the lower roof. Current building code provisions relate the size of these drifts to the size of the snow source area (i.e., upper-roof length for leeward drifts). In the 1998 version of the ASCE 7 Load Standard, provisions for windward roof step drifts were changed. These changes result in somewhat higher loadings compared to previous versions of the ASCE 7 Standard. Herein, we attempt to justify these new provisions for windward drifts by reviewing the research upon which the previous provisions were based and by analyzing a group of new windward roof step case histories.

AB - A two-story, single-family woodframe house, designed according to current engineered code seismic design requirements, was tested on a uniaxial shake table. The main objectives of this experimental study were to determine the dynamic characteristics and the seismic performance of the test structure under various base input intensities representative of both ordinary and near-field ground motions in southern California. The structure was tested with and without interior (gypsum wall board) and exterior (stucco) wall finish materials. The test results revealed good performance of the engineered woodframe structure. Wall finish materials are usually considered in design as nonstructural elements. However, the structure incorporating wall finish materials exhibited a substantial increase in its lateral stiffness and a dramatic reduction in its seismic displacement response. Furthermore, the seismic acceleration response of the structure was only moderately increased by the presence of wall finish materials. These shake table test results provide the motivation for further studies on the evaluation of the long-term effectiveness of wall finish materials as potential structural components of lateral load-resisting systems of woodframe structures.

AB - A probability-based reliability assessment methodology for single flexible piles and pile groups under stochastic lateral loads is developed. The methodology was based on state-of-the-art techniques for the analysis of single piles and pile groups as well as reliability assessment methods. Critical strength and serviceability modes of failure for flexible piles in sandy soil under lateral loads were defined. The reliability of a pile-group system was assessed by accounting for system redundancy with the occurrence of partial failures of the system components. Reliability indices and failure probabilities were used as relative measures for the performance of piles. A case study was presented to illustrate the proposed methodology.

AB - Wavelet transform (WT) is a mathematical tool that can decompose a temporal signal into a summation of time-domain basis functions of various frequency resolutions. This simultaneous time-frequency decomposition gives the WT a special advantage over the traditional Fourier transform in analyzing nonstationary signals. One drawback of the WT is that its resolution is rather poor in the high-frequency region. Since structural damage is typically a local phenomenon captured most likely by high frequency modes, this potential drawback can affect the application of the wavelet-based damage assessment techniques. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) adopts redundant basis functions and hence can provide an arbitrary time-frequency resolution. In this study, a WPT-based method is proposed for the damage assessment of structures. Dynamic signals measured from a structure are first decomposed into wavelet packet components. Component energies are then calculated and used as inputs into neural network models for damage assessment. Numerical simulations are performed on a three-span continuous bridge under impact excitation. The results show that the WPT-based component energies are good candidate indices that are sensitive to structural damage. These component energies can be used for various levels of damage assessment including identifying damage occurrence, location, and severity.

AB - Through minimization of the minimum values of the maximum displacement and acceleration dynamic magnification factors respectively, the optimum parameters of the multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs) with identical stiffness and damping coefficients but unequal mass have been extended. The optimum parameters include the optimum frequency spacing, average damping ratio, and tuning frequency ratio. The numerical results indicate that for the MTMD there exist the near-zero optimum average damping ratio, invariant optimum frequency spacing, irregular change of the optimum tuning frequency ratio, deteriorating range of the effectiveness, failure ranges of the total mass ratio, and maximum allowable total number, which implies that in order to ensure the reliable operation of the MTMD, it is of vital importance to select the optimum parameters of interest in the design.
