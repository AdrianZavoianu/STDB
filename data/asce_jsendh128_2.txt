AB - Displacement controlled shear tests on small concrete lift joint specimens with different surface roughnesses reinforced with an unbonded post-tension cable are conducted to study a related joint constitutive model, and to determine the failure mechanisms associated to it. To investigate the applicability of the joint model, shake table tests are conducted on a 3.4-m high plain concrete post-tensioned gravity dam that has a cold lift joint about midheight. Numerical simulations using the joint constitutive model are compared with the experimental results. From the displacement controlled shear tests, it is shown that the post-tension cable provides additional strength to the joint by applying an additional normal load on the joint, and by the shear resistance that can be mobilized (cable dowel action). The tests performed on rough surface joints have demonstrated that the dilatancy phenomenon due to asperities increases the post-tension force. Shake table tests on the 3.4-m high dam model have shown that post-tensioning largely reduces residual sliding displacements of the joint. This reduction is a function of the frequency content of the base excitation. However, a single post-tension cable placed near the upstream face increases the upstream rocking response of the upper block, which is also a function of the frequency content of the excitation. Strong seismic excitations can induce cable failure at a lower value than its uniaxial tensile strength when significant shear displacements take place. To describe this brittle failure mechanism, a cable failure criterion that considers the mobilized shear and tensile strengths was proposed and was found to be adequate. Moreover, the post-tensioned joint model proposed showed good agreement with the static and dynamic tests performed to evaluate the joint shear force.

AB - Nonreinforced masonry walls, used as infill panels in concrete frames, are vulnerable elements of buildings when subjected to earthquake loading. Gaps develop at the top of the walls, shortly after construction due to shrinkage of the mortar, and in the event of an earthquake the walls cannot withstand the out-of-plane forces and collapse due to the lack of adequate binding at the top. However, walls confined between rigid supports can display very high resistance to out-of-plane forces through the development of arching action in flexure. Therefore it is recommended, in order to achieve an optimal load-bearing behavior, or rather stability, that the remaining gap at the top of a wall is filled with nonshrinkable mortar some days after the construction of the wall. Shaking table tests, with full-scale walls subjected to transient seismic loads were carried out in order to study the out-of-plane behavior in relation to the characteristics at the top of the walls. A comparison of the measurements with the results from finite element calculations showed a satisfactory correlation.

AB - This paper presents experimental research findings of gravity-load-designed perforated waffle-slab systems. The tested system is part of an industrial facility where the floor is subjected to heavy gravity loads. The presented test program consists of two reduced-scale identical specimens modeling half the height of an interior column with a portion of the waffle slab bounded by the centerlines of adjacent bays. For seismic evaluation, lateral loading is applied at the tested column end in a bidirectional quasistatic manner. The results indicate high deformation ductility of the system with minor damage to the waffle slab. The mode of failure is governed by formation of stable plastic hinging at the junction between the column and the waffle-slab joists. Special attention is given to modeling the structural response at the column-joists region. Moment transfer between the column and the floor joists is discussed through the use of curvature distributions along the floor joists.

AB - A comparative study of the nonlinear behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) multistory structures is carried out on the basis of measured response of four six-story, three-bay framed structures, namely a regular bare frame, a discontinuous-column frame, a partially masonry-infilled frame, and a wall-frame system. The structures were designed for similar seismic requirements in accordance with Eurocode 8, and their 1:5.5 scaled models were subjected to similar earthquake simulation tests. Experimental observations and numerical analyses show that the distribution of the story shear overstrength is a rather stable indicator of the general inelastic behavior of frames, and hence, can be employed as a characteristic parameter to quantify the frame irregularity for design purposes. Abrupt discontinuity of the geometry or arrangement of structurally effective elements, where unavoidable, may be compensated by strength enhancement targeting a smoothed overstrength profile to allow for distributed inelastic deformation, and this principle applies as well to nonuniformly masonry infilled frames. For the wall-frame system, adequate countermeasures against rocking of the RC wall is shown to be a key to maintaining the effectiveness of the system at advanced inelastic response.

AB - In seismic design provisions, the maximum story drift occurring in major earthquakes is estimated by amplifying the drifts computed from an elastic analysis at the prescribed design seismic force level with a deflection amplification factor. A survey of several seismic design provisions indicates that the deflection amplification factor, in most of the provisions, is independent of significant factors such as ductility ratio, fundamental period, and number of stories. In this paper, a statistical evaluation of deflection amplification factor is presented in order to indicate the parameters that have an effect on this factor. Elastoplastic multidegree of freedom (MDOF) models with various dynamic characteristics are first considered. Consequently, nonlinear and corresponding linear time history analyses for 21 severe earthquake ground motions are performed in order to obtain structural response data, which are then used to derive an empirical formula for the deflection amplification factor. Finally, an approximate approach is developed for evaluating the maximum inelastic deflection of MDOF structures.

AB - An investigation is carried out of a 13-story building to assess the viability and effectiveness of a recently proposed roof isolation system that aims at reducing the response of buildings to earthquakes. The roof isolation system entails the insertion of flexible laminated rubber bearings between a building’s roof and the columns that support it, and the addition of viscous dampers connected between the roof and the rest of the building. It is based on the concept of a vibration absorber and the idea of constructing the mass, spring, and dashpot of such an absorber with the building’s roof, flexible bearings, and viscous dampers, respectively. The investigation includes a comparison of the building’s response under severe ground motion when it is considered with and without the isolation system, as well as determination of the properties and size of the isolation system components required. It is found that the proposed isolation system is effective, is able to be constructed, and has the potential to become an attractive way by which to reduce structural and nonstructural earthquake damage in low- and medium-rise buildings.

AB - The problem of optimal design of latticed transmission towers subjected to normal operating loads and an earthquake load is formulated. A time history analysis of the structure is performed. The constraints given in a design code are imposed. Many of the constraints are time dependent; therefore methods to treat them are incorporated in the solution process. All members are treated as equal- (unequal-) legged angle sections. The members are selected from the sections available in a manufacturer’s catalog. Two methods are presented and evaluated for such discrete variable optimization problems. The first method, called the two-phase method, uses a combination of continuous and discrete optimization algorithms, and the second one, called an adaptive discrete assignment method (ADAM), uses only a continuous optimization algorithm. The proposed methods are applicable to any discrete variable problem that can be formulated as a continuous problem. In addition, the problem is solved using a genetic algorithm (GA). The efficiency and practicality of the proposed methods are compared to those of the GA. From the results, it is concluded that the GA is a very straightforward method to use for discrete problems; however, it requires a significant amount of Central Processing Unit time. On the other hand, the two-phase method and the ADAM do not require as much computational effort but the discrete designs found with them are slightly more expensive. Also, numerical implementation of the two methods requires more effort.

AB - The paper develops a probabilistic model to estimate the probability of structural collapse (system risk) during the construction of typical multistory reinforced concrete buildings. The influence of the number of levels of shoring/reshoring, construction cycle and concreting workmanship (curing and compaction), concrete grade, and number of floors of the building on system risk is included in the analysis. It was found that poor concreting workmanship is more detrimental to system risk than reducing the construction cycle by a few days. It was found also that if the design process ignores construction loading on the slab during construction, then a dramatic loss of structural safety can occur.

AB - In this paper, the dynamic vehicle element (DVE) method is developed to solve the transient response of a vehicle–structure interaction system in time domain. The DVE method treats the vehicle as a moving part of the entire system, which considers the vehicle influence at the element level by incorporating the detailed interaction between multiple vehicles and the structure induced by irregular road profiles. In addition, a simplified decoupled dynamic nodal loading (DNL) method is proposed. The DNL method generates a time series of concentrated nodal loading which represents the vehicle reaction force on the structure. The DNL method therefore, accounts for the road irregularities and vehicle inertia effect, but neglects the interaction between the two subsystems. The simplified DNL method can be degenerated into the commonly used moving mass (MM) method and moving load (ML) method. The DVE, DNL, MM, and ML methods are compared via the results of four numerical examples. Parametric studies for the effects of road roughness, speed parameter, mass ratio, and frequency ratio on the dynamic vehicle–structure interaction are then carried out using the DVE and DNL methods.

AB - The interaction of an arbitrary structure with its foundation soil is treated by representing the stratified soil with the end of a linear elastic half space model with specific geometrical and elastic properties for its layers. The proposed procedure is based on a purely analytical treatment of the underlying soil model, as well as on the use of a structural model with fictitious supports inserted at the contact nodes of the foundation elements with the soil surface. The availability of a general purpose finite element program is a prerequisite in order to carry out the analysis of the structural model. The analysis for an arbitrary static loading is performed by using the stiffness matrices of the soil surface and of the structure with respect to their contact nodes. This approach provides a flexible framework to perform parametric studies to include the variability of soil properties. Three numerical examples are presented and the results are compared with those based on Winkler’s assumption of modulus of subgrade reaction.

AB - The dynamic behavior of a magnetorheological (MR) damper is well portrayed using a Bouc–Wen hysteresis model. This model estimates damper forces based on the inputs of displacement, velocity, and voltage. In some control applications, it is necessary to command the damper so that it produces desirable control forces calculated based on some optimal control algorithms. In such cases, it is beneficial to develop an inverse dynamic model that estimates the required voltage to be input to the damper so that a desirable damper force can be produced. In this study, we explore such a possibility via the neural network (NN) technique. Recurrent NN models will be constructed to emulate the inverse dynamics of the MR damper. To illustrate the use of these NN models, two control applications will be studied: one is the optimal prediction control of a single-degree-of-freedom system and the other is the linear quadratic regulator control of a multiple-degree-of-freedom system. Numerical results indicate that, using the recurrent NN models, the MR damper force can be commanded to follow closely the desirable optimal control force.

AB - This experimental study investigates the use of Rayleigh waves for crack detection in structural elements. Receiver arrays measure surface accelerations at various locations with respect to a vertical slot cut into a thin Plexiglas sheet. Two-dimensional Fourier transform calculations provide Rayleigh wave dispersion and energy with respect to various slot depths. In addition, autospectrum calculations aid in defining slot location. It is shown that slots reflect short wavelengths and allow the transmission of long wavelengths. Slot location is easily identified from autospectrum measurements; however, accurate determination of slot depth is dependent on the aperture function of the array.

AB - This paper highlights the problems encountered in bending and vibration analysis of thin plates when using the p-Ritz method for computing the stress resultants, especially the twisting moments and shear forces. In the p-Ritz method, products of mathematically complete two-dimensional polynomial functions and boundary polynomial equations raised to appropriate powers are used to approximate the displacements. This ensures the satisfaction of the geometric boundary conditions. However, it is found that the distributions of the twisting moment and shear forces contain unacceptable oscillations, and for plates with free edges these stress resultants do not satisfy the natural boundary conditions. A method to overcome the aforementioned problems is proposed here. The penalty function method is used to satisfy the natural boundary conditions and postprocessing of the stress resultants to eliminate the oscillations. Some examples of static and vibration problems of plates are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for overcoming the shortcomings inherent in the p-Ritz method.

AB - Current structural codes have been developed mainly for new design and are not efficient for assessment because of significant differences between these situations. One of the main differences is the possibility to update information about an existing structure. This paper proposes a way in which updating can be taken into account when developing code safety formats (partial factor and load and resistance factor design). Updating information about individual structural properties such as material strengths by carrying out on-site inspections is discussed. Uncertainties associated with on-site testing including “model” uncertainty are considered and a method for treating these uncertainties in the context of the partial factor format is described. Results indicate that “model” uncertainty may have a significant effect on partial factors. Furthermore, we consider updating information about the resistance of the whole structure by proof load testing or by taking into account the previous safe performance of a structure. Results show that to increase the resistance reduction factor, the level of proof load needs to be high, resulting in a rather high risk of failure during the test. Satisfactory past performance does not have any noticeable effect on resistance factor, but it does have a more significant effect on probability of failure.

AB - This paper is concerned with the determination of the funicular shapes of submerged arches. A universal set of curves is generated, from which the shapes of funicular arches under hydrostatic forces may be extracted. The method of extraction of the funicular arch shape depends on the specified design parameters such as the water depth, arch height, and arch span. More importantly, this study shows that depending on the specification of the design parameters, there may not exist any funicular arch solution or there may be occasions in which there could be more than one funicular arch solution for the problem.
