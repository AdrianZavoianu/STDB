AB - A comprehensive study has been conducted to investigate the behavior and strength of a new type of partially encased composite column made with thin-walled, welded I-section, stiffened with transverse links. Concrete is poured between the flanges of the steel section. The paper describes and presents the results of the testing of five large-size 600×600mm short column specimens. Failure of all specimens was due to local buckling of the flange plates along with concrete crushing. Transverse stresses measured in the steel section were found to be small and did not impair the axial compressive strength of the steel section. High stresses, however, developed in the transverse links as a result of the lateral expansion of the concrete. The study also shows that closer link spacing and the use of additional reinforcements can improve the post-ultimate load behavior. A comparison is made with test results obtained in previous studies on smaller specimens and an improved formula for predicting the column axial load capacity accounting for local flange buckling and the variation of the concrete strength with column size is proposed for design application.

AB - Open cross-section, thin-walled, cold-formed steel columns have at least three competing buckling modes: local, distortional, and Euler (i.e., flexural or flexural-torsional) buckling. Closed-form prediction of the buckling stress in the local mode, including interaction of the connected elements, and the distortional mode, including consideration of the elastic and geometric stiffness at the web/flange juncture, are provided and shown to agree well with numerical methods. Numerical analyses and experiments indicate postbuckling capacity in the distortional mode is lower than in the local mode. Current North American design specifications for cold-formed steel columns ignore local buckling interaction and do not provide an explicit check for distortional buckling. Existing experiments on cold-formed channel, zed, and rack columns indicate inconsistency and systematic error in current design methods and provide validation for alternative methods. A new method is proposed for design that explicitly incorporates local, distortional and Euler buckling, does not require calculations of effective width and/or effective properties, gives reliable predictions devoid of systematic error, and provides a means to introduce rational analysis for elastic buckling prediction into the design of thin-walled columns.

AB - An experimental investigation of cold-formed channels subjected to combined bending and web crippling is described in this paper. A series of tests was performed on unlipped channels rolled from high strength structural steel sheets having nominal plate thickness up to 6 mm, and a maximum web slenderness value of 45. This value is considerably lower than the intended web slenderness values used in the Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS 1996) and the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI 1996) specification for cold-formed steel structures. Therefore, the appropriateness of the combined bending and web crippling design rules for members with comparatively stocky webs is investigated in this paper. The specimens were tested at various lengths using the Interior-One-Flange loading condition specified in the AS/NZS (1996) and the AISI (1996) specification, and the test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained from these specifications. Generally, it is shown that the specifications conservatively predicted the strengths of unlipped channels having stocky webs subjected to combined bending and web crippling.

AB - The flexural force-deformation behavior of high strength square concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) beam-columns was experimentally investigated. The parameters in the study included the width-to-thickness (b/t) ratio, the yield stress (σy) of the steel tube, and the axial load level. Eight CFT beam-column specimens were tested under constant axial load and monotonically increasing flexural loading. The CFT specimens were 305-mm square tubes with nominal b/t ratios of 32 or 48, made from either conventional (A500 Grade-B) or high strength (A500 Grade-80) steel, and filled with high strength (110 MPa) concrete. Experimental results indicate that the moment capacity of CFT beam-columns is reached as inelastic behavior of the steel tube and concrete infill is combined with local buckling of the steel tube and crushing of the concrete. The moment capacity of high strength square CFT beam-columns can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using the current American Concrete Institute code provisions for composite columns. The curvature ductility of high strength square CFT beam-columns decreases significantly with an increase in either the axial load level or the b/t ratio of the steel tube. The yield stress of the steel tube does not seem to have a significant influence on curvature ductility.

AB - To ensure the safety of elevated highway bridges under major earthquakes, it is important to predict the ultimate behavior of columns used as bridge piers. After the Kobe earthquake, many analytical and experimental studies have been conducted to examine the ultimate seismic behavior of thin-walled steel columns. However, these studies are mostly restricted to the in-plane behavior of the columns. As observed in the Kobe earthquake, the damages to the columns are usually influenced by the two-dimensional horizontal seismic excitations. Therefore, it is more desirable to consider the effect of biaxial bending at the ultimate stage of earthquake response in the design of steel columns. Herein, we propose a hysteretic model of thin-walled circular steel columns under biaxial bending to predict the ultimate seismic behavior of cantilever-type thin-walled circular steel columns with constant axial load. The proposed column model consists of a concentrated mass and a rigid column with multiple nonlinear springs located at the column base. As the hysteretic constitutive relation for each spring, we adopt the Dafalias and Popov’s bounding-line model by modifying the original model in order to take into account the local buckling behavior. The material constants of the modified bounding-line model can be determined, based on the in-plane hysteretic behavior of the column obtained either by FEM shell analyses or by experiments. The validity of the proposed model is examined by comparing it with results of the two-dimensional horizontal earthquake-response analyses, using the FEM shell model.

AB - Bolted flange-plate connections represent a practical and inexpensive solution for splicing axially loaded steel members. Research on bolted hollow section splices has hitherto been mainly focused on flange-plate connections for circular hollow sections or connections for rectangular hollow sections with bolts only on two sides of the connection. This paper presents the results of a study on connections for square hollow sections with bolts symmetrically placed on all four sides of the tube and the hollow section loaded in axial tension. As with earlier studies, the prying forces were of major interest. Strain gaged bolts as well as an ultrasonic bolt gage monitored the bolt forces during the tests to reveal any prying action. A total of 16 specimens varying in the number of bolts, bolt layout, and flange-plate thickness were tested. Different existing design methods and analytical models are presented and their corresponding connection strength predictions are compared to the results of the tests, as well as 10 further tests done previously by others. It was found that a slightly adjusted version of the design procedure provided by the AISC HSS Connections Manual (1997) gave the best predictions.

AB - Current AASHTO and AISC specifications require that an intermediate transverse stiffener attached on the shear web panel be designed not only to have a proper bending rigidity to meet the simply supported condition when the web panel buckles, but to have a proper area in order to resist the compression developed due to diagonal tension in the postbuckling range as well. However, the equation for the required areas, which was suggested by Basler in 1963 has been known to be conservative. According to recent studies, Basler’s assumption for the formulation of the design equation appears to be questionable. In this paper, the behavior of the transverse stiffeners is investigated through a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element analysis. This finite element analysis gives results that are contrary to Basler’s questionable assumption. The transverse stiffener is not necessarily subjected to axial compression in the postbuckling stage, and therefore, the requirement for the minimum areas can be voided. A shear transfer model called “shear cell analogy” is presented in order to describe the postbuckling behavior of the shear web panel in a manner different from those in the literature to date. This analogy is also used to explain why axial compressive stresses do not develop in the transverse stiffeners.

AB - This is the first of two papers that presents the theory and applications of three different formulations of reinforced concrete frame elements with bond slip in the reinforcing bars. This paper presents the governing differential equations of the problem (strong form) and the three different element formulations (weak forms). The first is the displacement-based formulation, which is derived from the principle of stationary potential energy. The second is the force-based formulation, which is derived from the principle of stationary complementary energy. The third is the two-field mixed formulation, which is derived from the principle of stationary Hellinger–Reissner potential. The selection of the displacement and force shape functions for the different formulations is discussed. Tonti’s diagrams are used to conveniently represent the equations that govern both the strong and the weak forms of the problem. This paper derives the general matrix equations of the three formulations. Implementation of the formulations in a general-purposed nonlinear structural analysis software and a set of applications are discussed in the companion paper.

AB - This is the second of two papers discussing the theories and applications of three reinforced concrete (RC) frame elements with bond slip between the reinforcing bars and the concrete. This paper presents the element state determinations for the displacement-based, the force-based, and the Hellinger–Reissner mixed formulations. The convergence, accuracy, and computational times of the three elements are compared through two numerical examples. The distinctive element characteristics in terms of force and deformation discontinuities between adjacent elements are discussed for the three proposed formulations. The ability of these formulations to detect the overall softening response of RC members due to the pullout failure of the rebars in the anchorage zone is also tested. The elements are all able to capture the drop in member stiffness due to the rebar slip and the failure due to bar pullout. The force-based and the mixed elements are, however, much more precise than the displacement-based element. The force-based element is slightly more precise, but the mixed element is numerically more stable.

AB - Building structures subjected to fire will generally experience complex force-temperature paths. In this paper, these paths are expressed simply by two basic paths: the path of constant forces but subjected to elevated temperature (FT path), and the path of constant temperature but subjected to applying forces (TF path). A total of 13 beam specimens subjected to two such basic paths were tested. The results show that the fire resistance for the FT path is different from that for the TF path; the former is always greater than the latter, and the two are similar only when the temperature exceeds 525°C or thereabout. However, there are always great differences between their deformations. Therefore, the behaviors of reinforced concrete flexural members subjected to fire are closely dependent on the force-temperature paths they experience. Thus, in fire-resistant design, especially for statically indeterminate structures, to more accurately ascertain their fire resistances the force-temperature path factor cannot be neglected.

AB - Compression-web members in metal-plate-connected wood trusses may buckle elastically as long slender columns. One common construction technique is to nail a side member on the compression-web member (main member) so that the cross section is “T” shaped, thus increasing the cross-sectional dimensions and the critical buckling load. The bracing efficiency of the T-brace is not known. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of the main-member length, side-member length, and connection method on T-brace efficiency by measuring the first buckling-mode critical load. Finite-element models were developed with simply supported ends and side members that varied from full length to one-quarter length. The models had side members attached with either 16d common nails or phenol-resorcinol adhesive. The results of a finite-element investigation were used to determine which T-brace geometries to test. The testing program included full-length, half-length, and quarter-length side members nailed or glued to 1,830 and 3,050-mm main members. The testing results paralleled the finite-element results. The T-brace assemblies exhibited a linear minor-axis bending deflection from the onset of loading until an instability load was reached; the deflection then increased without bound. Some slipping between the main and side members was observed in the nailed assemblies, and twisting was evident in the deformed shape of the adhesive-attached assemblies. T-bracing was most efficient for very long members; its effectiveness increased with increasing side-member length. Adhesive-attached side members were more effective than nail attached. The effects of end geometry and out-of-plane metal plate bending were not investigated but could have a substantial effect.

AB - A nailed joint system, comprising of two slotted-in steel plates with shot-through smooth round steel nails in glulam, was analyzed from the viewpoint of an engineering description of the ductility behavior. Experiments on 15 specimens, with 10 nails in each specimen, were performed. Based on the results, a model describing the ductility behavior is proposed. Ductility is defined as the ratio of ultimate-to-elastic deformations with the ultimate deformation defined as the first load drop corresponding to wood splitting. The model is based on “engineering” parameters and estimates the engineering ductility from the slenderness ratio, timber density, and the fastener yield strength in bending. The model is compared with similar experiments in the literature and the validation shows correlation. The method of solution, based on the plastic theory of the European yield model for dowels, is general, and is applicable to other timber-to-timber or timber-to-steel dowel-type connections. The engineering ductility philosophy can give engineers a tool to assess ductility for connections in timber structures.

AB - Underground explosion generates high-frequency, short-duration, and large-amplitude ground motions which may cause damage to nearby surface structures. The commonly used damage assessment method in earthquake engineering cannot capture local damages and propagation properties of stress wave produced in a structure by such high-frequency ground motion. In the present study, damage assessment is developed at the material level for reinforced concrete structure excited by underground-explosion-induced ground motion. A numerical method of wave propagation in nonlinear and composite media is adopted to assess wave motion and structural damage of a two-story frame located at different surface distances from the underground explosion epicenter. A fracture indicator determined by equivalent tensile strain is defined to assess concrete damage, and a plastic indicator based on effective plastic strain is used to identify the plastic state of reinforcement. Ground velocity at the structural supports is used as input. The proposed material model is implemented in a commercial software AUTODYN through its user-supplied subroutines. Distributed concrete damage induced by high-frequency response is simulated. The effect of vertical ground motion is illustrated clearly. The numerical results show that the current design code based on ground motion peak particle velocity alone is rather conservative.

AB - The concept of prestressing of civil engineering structures is well known, consisting of the introduction of a set of self-equilibrating forces upon the structure that will try to counteract the internal forces generated in the structure by the external actions. Those prestressing forces depend upon the layout and forces of the cables, not accounting for the variations on the external actions during the life of the structure. The rapid technological evolution of the last quarter of the 20th Century gave credit to structural solutions with adaptive behavior–intelligent structures. Organic prestressing is part of that environment. But it is no more than a prestressing system under on-line control, capable of variation in the forces introduced in the cables, thus improving significantly the prestressing effect. A brief reference to organic prestressing research is presented and the most relevant concepts are described together with the corresponding control algorithms. Undesirable control phenomena are defined and measures to avoid them are presented. Main technological aspects are mentioned. An example is used to emphasize the performance of organic structural solutions.

AB - A horizontally curved beam element of arbitrary shape having three nodes and three degrees of freedom (vertical deflection, bending rotation, and twisting rotation) at each node is presented. The proposed element looks like an isoparametric curved beam element but it is based on a different formulation. The effect of shear deformation is incorporated in an efficient manner and to make the element free from locking in shear, which is a well-known problem of the isoparametric element. In this formulation, the field variables taken are vertical deflection, shear strain, and twisting rotation. It should be noted that shear strain is one of the field variables unlike isoparametric and other usual elements where bending rotation is the corresponding field variable. Moreover the order of interpolating polynomial used for the different field variables is identical in the isoparametric element, while it is different in the present case. Numerical examples are solved to validate the proposed element and to show its accuracy and range of applicability.
