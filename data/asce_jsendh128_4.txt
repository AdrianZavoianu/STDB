AB - Welded-flange–bolted-web connections were damaged during the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. The SAC Steel Project was started to address the problems associated with this damage. The Connection Performance Team completed research on the behavior of a number of connection types. During this research, some issues were found to influence the behavior of many different connection types. These issues are described in this paper. The issues include panel zone yielding, weld process and toughness, web attachment, beam depth and frame geometry, yield stress of the steel, geometry and orientation of the column, composite slabs, local slenderness and unsupported length, temperature, and strain rate. Panel zone yielding is a yield mechanism that contributes to ductility of moment frame connections, but connections with excessive panel zone deformation may have premature connection fracture and reduced ductility. Therefore, panel zone yield deformation must be controlled to have balanced behavior. The web attachment combined with tough welds and improved weld and weld access hole details were needed to improve the ductility of welded flange connections. Beam depth and span length affect the ductility and performance of moment frame connections, but some factors including temperature, strain rate, and local buckling are of secondary importance.

AB - The results of an experimental study of the seismic performance of improved, welded unreinforced beam-to-column moment connections are presented. The study involved the inelastic cyclic testing of 11 full-scale connection specimens to evaluate the effects of weld access hole geometry, beam web attachment detail, panel zone strength, continuity plates, and composite slab on connection performance. With a high toughness weld metal and modified detailing, it is demonstrated that a welded unreinforced flange moment connection can reliably achieve an inelastic rotation of 0.03 rad or more prior to failure. The modified details include the use of a weld access hole with a modified geometry and a welded beam web. The test results indicate that a strong panel zone enhances inelastic connection performance. Based on the results of the study recommendations are given for the seismic-resistant design of improved welded unreinforced connections for steel moment-resisting frames.

AB - This paper describes an experimental study on radius cut reduced beam section (RBS) moment connections for use in seismic resistant steel moment frames. The effects of panel zone strength, composite behavior with a concrete slab, and the beam web-to-column flange connection were specifically addressed in these tests. In total, eight double-sided specimens were designed, fabricated, and tested in this study, providing data for sixteen individual RBS connections. Each specimen was subjected to a standard quasi-static cyclic load pattern. Overall, the specimens performed well with seven of the eight achieving total (elastic plus plastic) story drift ratios of at least 0.04 radians in magnitude before experiencing 20% strength degradation. The other test was stopped due to out-of-plane instability after being loaded to 0.03 radians of total story drift. Comparison of the response of specimens with strong panel zones, balanced panel zones, and weak panel zones relative to beam strength led to the conclusion that weak panel zones allow for the most stable hysteretic response at large drift levels. Inclusion of a composite slab in these tests appeared to stabilize the beams against lateral torsional buckling with no consistently detectable increase in the strains in the bottom beam flange. Welding the beam web to the column flange seemed to decrease the likelihood of weld fracture in these specimens.

AB - In a study of previous weak-axis moment connection tests it was noticed that the most common failure mode was brittle fracture initiating near the edge of the beam flange groove weld. The cause was large stress concentrations due to force flow towards the stiffer column flanges, which is the opposite pattern as strong-axis moment connections. As part of the SAC (a partnership of SEAoC, ATC, and CUREE) study, two full-scale weak-axis moment connections, utilizing the reduced beam section (RBS) design, were statically tested under simulated seismic loading. Both specimens were able to reach the required 0.03 rad of plastic rotation without experiencing brittle fracture or large stress concentrations at the critical section. A series of parametric studies was carried out, using a finite-element analysis program, to better understand the behavior of weak-axis RBS moment connections. It was found that the RBS was able to reduce the critical strain concentration by a factor of nearly three as compared to specimens without the RBS. Based on these analytical results and experimental tests, a design procedure for weak-axis RBS moment connections was developed.

AB - Design engineers frequently use deep columns in steel special moment resisting frames to control drift. As the reduced beam section (RBS) moment connection is becoming popular after the 1994 Northridge, California earthquake, the SAC Joint Venture initiated a testing program to study the cyclic behavior of deep-column RBS moment connections. The test results showed that the deep column is prone to twisting. The twisting was caused by the eccentric beam flange force due to lateral-torsional buckling of the beam. In this paper, cycle tests results of three RBS moment connections with deep columns are presented. An analytical study showed that the warping stress is highly dependent on the h/tcf3 ratio of the column section. A design procedure is proposed that can be used to evaluate if column twisting is a concern. Additional bracing near the RBS region is recommended if the design procedure indicates high stresses.

AB - Nonlinear finite-element modeling of steel moment-resisting connections reinforced with steel plates was undertaken as part of the second phase of the SAC project. Five cover-plate and five flange-plate connections of W14×176 columns to W30×99 beams were studied. Connections reinforced with cover plates or flange plates will perform substantially better than unreinforced connections. Flange-plate connections are likely superior to cover-plate connections. Rectangular reinforcing plates are superior to trapezoidal shaped plates. Three-sided fillet welds should be used to join reinforcing plates to beam flanges. Bracing the beam flanges outside the plastic hinge remote from the column face to delay lateral-torsional buckling is not necessary. Beam web reinforcement at the column face does not affect the transfer of shear force from the reinforced beam to the column. Beam theory should not be used to estimate stresses in reinforced connections.

AB - Five cover-plate and five flange-plate single-sided steel moment-resisting beam–column assemblies were tested at full scale. Grade 50 steel was used for the W14×176 columns, the W30×99 beams, and all reinforcing plates. The procedures of FEMA 267A were used to design and detail the connections that included rectangular-, trapezoidal-, and swallowtail-shaped reinforcing plates. Cyclic and near-field loading histories were used to test the connections. None of the ten connections failed in a brittle manner; the strength of each connection degraded slowly due to local buckling of the beam web and flanges. The maximum beam plastic hinge rotations ranged between 2.3 and 3.9% rad. The cover-plate and flange-plate connections performed equally well but neither connection was subjected to large plastic strains at the face of the column. The performance of the tested plate-reinforced connections was best when rectangular reinforcing plates and three-sided fillet welds joining the reinforcing plate to the beam flange were used. Bracing of the beam bottom flange outside the plastic hinge zone to delay lateral-torsional buckling did not produce any significant improvement in connection hysteresis. Increased beam web compactness (smaller height to thickness) delayed the loss of strength and stiffness in the beam–column connection.

AB - The inelastic behavior and failure modes of eight full-scale bolted flange plate connections are discussed. This series of tests investigated two modes of behavior: hinging girder and hinging flange plate mechanisms. The tests demonstrated that this connection type induces several mechanisms of stable inelastic behavior including panel zone distortion, bolt-slip, flange plate hinging, and girder hinging beyond the flange plate connection. The failure mode for five of the eight specimens was by ductile tearing of the net girder section beyond the end of the bolted flange plate connection. These were also specimens that experienced a significant amount of girder hinging. Clamp plates added to the end of the flange plate connection prevented net section tearing for at least one specimen and fractured the beam flange and web in the girder hinge region. One specimen failed by fracture of the flange plate in the heat-affected zone of the welded joint. Finally, the specimen that induced significant flange plate hinging failed by fracture across the flange plate.

AB - Extended end-plate moment connections are one alternative to fully welded connections that has been considered for use in seismic force resisting moment frames. As a part of the SAC Steel Project, a research program to investigate the behavior and design of extended end-plate moment connections under cyclic loading was conducted at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Six bare steel beam-to-column connection specimens and one composite slab beam-to-column connection specimen were tested. An overview of the design, fabrication, and testing of the specimens is presented. The test results show that extended end-plate moment connections can be designed to provide the strength, stiffness, and ductility required for use in seismic force resisting moment frames. The effects of the composite slab are discussed, and it is recommended that the effects of the slab be considered in the design of beam-to-column extended end-plate moment connections.

AB - Experimental studies were conducted to investigate the application of fracture tough overlay welds for the upgrading of welded steel moment connections. The experimental program consisted of cyclic tests on three exterior connection specimens that were initially fabricated using pre-Northridge welding procedures. Two specimens were fabricated from small size sections and one was fabricated from an intermediate size section. Overlay welds were placed using self-shielded flux core arc weld (FCAW-ss) with a fracture tough electrode (E70T-8). The application of weld overlays to the small size specimens resulted in a significant improvement in their cyclic performance. The plastic rotation capacity of both specimens was either close to or exceeded 3%. The application of weld overlays to the moment connection of the intermediate size specimen also improved the rotation capacity. However, the upgraded specimen failed in the parent material of the beam flange, away from the weld region at a plastic rotation of 2.7%.

AB - Welded-flange-bolted-web connections were damaged during the Northridge Earthquake, and the SAC Steel Project was started to find solutions to the problems caused by this damage. The Connection Performance Team was one of several groups completing the project research, and this group examined all connection performance issues. A number of connections were evaluated, and three strategies were used to improve the seismic performance of different connections. An understanding of all yield mechanisms and failure modes for each connection type is required for application of these improvement strategies. Variations in yield mechanisms and failure modes obtained for different connection types are described, and the application of these modes and mechanisms to improve the seismic performance of three different connections is summarized. The three connections are the welded-flange-welded-web, reduced-beam-section, and bolted-flange-plate connections. These connections are all capable of providing good seismic performance with large plastic rotational capacity, but each connection requires evaluation of different modes and mechanisms and different balance requirements for good seismic performance. The strategies and procedures used for these connections are typical of those used for many other connections.

AB - This paper presents a formal probabilistic framework for seismic design and assessment of structures and its application to steel moment-resisting frame buildings. This is the probabilistic basis for the 2000 SAC Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) steel moment frame guidelines. The framework is based on realizing a performance objective expressed as the probability of exceeding a specified performance level. Performance levels are quantified as expressions relating generic structural variables “demand” and “capacity” that are described by nonlinear, dynamic displacements of the structure. Common probabilistic analysis tools are used to convolve both the randomness and uncertainty characteristics of ground motion intensity, structural “demand,” and structural system “capacity” in order to derive an expression for the probability of achieving the specified performance level. Stemming from this probabilistic framework, a safety-checking format of the conventional “load and resistance factor” kind is developed with load and resistance terms being replaced by the more generic terms “demand” and “capacity,” respectively. This framework also allows for a format based on quantitative confidence statements regarding the likelihood of the performance objective being met. This format has been adopted in the SAC/FEMA guidelines.

AB - A performance prediction and evaluation procedure based on nonlinear dynamics and reliability theory is presented. It features full integration over the three key stochastic models: ground motion hazard curve, nonlinear dynamic displacement demand, and displacement capacity. Further, both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties are evaluated and carried through the analysis. A suite of uncertainty analyses are input to the procedure such as period, live load, material properties, damping, analysis procedure, and orientation of the structure. Two limit states are defined instead of the traditional single state. The procedure provides a simple method for estimating the confidence level for satisfying the performance level for a given hazard. The confidence level of a post- and a pre-Northridge nine-story building for a given hazard level is calculated using the procedure described in the paper. New steel moment frame buildings are expected to perform much better during major earthquakes than existing buildings designed and built with older technologies.

AB - As part of the (FEMA/SAC) Phase 2 program, this study focused on performance prediction and evaluation of existing steel SMRF buildings assumed to be built prior to the Northridge Earthquake. Several classes of buildings, which are representative of typical buildings based on year of construction and brittle pre-Northridge connections, were designed in accordance with the 1973, 1985, and 1994 UBC provisions. Then, the frame analysis models were developed including the effects of brittle connections, panel zone deformation, and interior gravity frames. Based on the drift demands and capacities calculated using each set of 20 SAC ground motions representing 2/50 and 50/50 hazard levels, a performance prediction and evaluation procedure based on the reliability framework is presented. Confidence levels that existing buildings will exceed the predefined performance level for different hazard levels are calculated. The pre-Northridge design and construction represented by the old building codes and brittle connections force the buildings to experience large seismic demand and result in a low confidence level in achieving the desired performance levels.
