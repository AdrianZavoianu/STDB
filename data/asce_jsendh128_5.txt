AB - In strut-and-tie modeling the efficiency factor is used to take into account the lower strength of struts relative to the uniaxial strength of the concrete. The reduction in strength is justified on the grounds of the brittle nature of concrete and on the basis of the effects of transverse tension fields on the strength of the struts. In this paper, the available models for the efficiency factor are reviewed and new models proposed, which are compared with the test results of 135 nonflexural structural elements such as deep beams, corbels, and nibs. The results show that the efficiency factor has only a week relationship with the concrete strength and that the more important parameter is the angle of the strut relative to the longitudinal axis of the member. Efficiency models based solely, or primarily, on the concrete strength are found to have a poor correlation with the data. Efficiency models that account for the angle of the strut and models based on the modified compression field theory are found to give the best correlation with the test results.

AB - The moment capacity and failure modes of four types of beams with high reinforcement ratios are reported. The tests were planned and conducted in order to examine a quantitative measure that had been proposed to evaluate an upper limit to the compression reinforcement ratio ρmax′, for flexural reinforced concrete members. The concept that was examined was the derivation of a quantitative criteria for ρmax′ from steel congestion and proficient design considerations (i.e., tension failure and sufficient rotation capacity at the ultimate limit state) and from considerations related to diagonal compression capacity. The tests were designed with relatively high compression reinforcement ratios of up to 4.8%, in order to show the influence of parameters that affect this limit, i.e., the beam geometry (L/d ratio, cross-section dimensions, and concrete cover), and the moment-to-shear loading ratio. The results of the tests reported here agreed with the trends as well as the quantitative predictions of the theoretical moment capacities. Thus, they strengthen the proposed approach for setting an upper limit to the longitudinal compression reinforcement ρ′ in flexural reinforced concrete members.

AB - An analytical model, based on the commonly used equivalent cantilever concept, is developed for assessing the local ductility demand of a yielding pile-shaft when subjected to lateral loading. For elastic response of the pile-shaft, an equivalent depth-to-fixity is assumed, which can be derived by equating the lateral stiffness of the cantilever to that of the elastic soil-pile system. In adapting the equivalent cantilever model to yielding pile-shafts, however, the depth-to-maximum-moment is assumed to occur at a depth above the depth-to-fixity. The lateral strength, which depends on the depth-to-maximum-moment, is determined using the flexural strength of the pile and the ultimate pressure distribution of the soil. By assuming a concentrated plastic hinge rotation at the depth-of-maximum-moment, a kinematic model relating the local curvature ductility demand to global displacement ductility demand is developed. The kinematic relation is shown to depend on the aboveground height, depth-to-maximum-moment, depth-to-fixity, and equivalent plastic hinge length. The model is illustrated using a pile-shaft embedded in cohesive and cohesionless soils.

AB - Results of an experimental program investigating the lateral strength and ductility capacity of reinforced concrete piles are presented. Four full-scale reinforced concrete piles with details representative of the current California design were tested under combined axial compression and reversed cyclic lateral displacement. Test parameters include confining steel ratio, aboveground height, and soil density. Of particular interests are the lateral strength and stiffness of the soil-pile system, depth-to-maximum-moment, and magnitude of local deformation upon formation of a plastic hinge in the pile. Equivalent plastic hinge lengths were determined using curvatures measured along the length of the pile. Test results indicated that the equivalent plastic hinge length of piles is generally longer than that of an equivalent base-restrained column. The equivalent plastic hinge length of the pile depends primarily on the aboveground height of the pile, but is not overly sensitive to the soil density. Test results also provided the basis for an analytical model presented in a companion paper for assessing the local ductility demand of a yielding pile-shaft.

AB - Multicellular concrete box docks are an extensively used structural alternative for building vertical harbor quays or breakwaters. The prefabrication techniques employed for building them guarantee quality, speed, and cost control, conditions difficult to achieve with more traditional technologies. However, a major problem arises from the fact that both their constructive process and their setting in operation may generate levels of strain above those corresponding to normal service. Consequently, intermediate load states need to be considered in the design phase of the box dock. Another aspect to be taken into account is the three-dimensional behavior of the box dock that cannot be completely described using the traditional simplified approaches almost exclusively employed in actual design. It is shown how a global safety factor may be deduced through use of material nonlinear analysis and how this may help in the design process of a box dock. This study is focused on the possibility of eliminating the vertical reinforcement steel bars of box docks.

AB - Many theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out on fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP)-confined circular concrete specimens, leading to a variety of models for predicting their axial compressive strengths. In this paper, a large test database assembled from an extensive survey of existing studies is presented and employed to assess available axial strength models for FRP-confined concrete. The test database is also deployed to examine the effect of various factors on the performance of FRP-confined concrete. This study shows that the confinement effectiveness of FRP based on reported test results depends little on unconfined concrete strength, size, and length-to-diameter ratio of test specimens and FRP type, but depends significantly on the accuracy of the reported tensile strength of the FRP. The inherent variation of unconfined concrete strength also causes some scatter of data at low confinement ratios. Using those test data with accurate FRP tensile strengths, only two of the nine existing models are found to give close predictions. A new simple model is finally proposed, based on the observation that a linear relationship exists between the confined concrete strength and the lateral confining pressure from the FRP.

AB - Existing reinforced concrete (RC) beams are commonly enhanced in flexure by bonding steel or fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) plates to their tension faces. At the time of plating, preexisting loads, such as dead loads, are present on the beams. Although these loads clearly do not induce strains in the plates, flexural capacity design calculations for plated beams using RC theory tacitly incorporate the corresponding fictitious preexisting strains in the plates. If the plates are elastic at section flexural failure, as might be the case for steel plates and is always the case for FRP plates, this design approach underestimates the area of plate required for a given increase in flexural capacity, thus giving a weaker plated RC section than required. For steel-plated sections in which both the internal steel and plate steel yield before concrete crushing occurs, preexisting strains do not influence the area of plate required, but they do delay yield and so reduce ductility. In such cases, neglect of preexisting strains does not affect strength, but it does lead to overestimate of available ductility. This has implications for design of statically indeterminate plated RC beams. Owing to uncertainties in parameters such as creep and differential settlement, preexisting strains do not lend themselves to accurate evaluation. Hence it seems prudent, as a first step, to establish the sensitivity of the flexural failure behavior of plated RC sections to varying preexisting strains. In this paper, mechanical models for plated RC section flexural behavior, which allow for steel and concrete material nonlinearities and for preexisting strains, are presented. The models are first verified by comparison with experimental data, and are then used to determine areas of FRP or steel plating required for stated flexural capacity increases of a given RC section, based on either ignoring or fully recognizing varying levels of preexisting strain. The moment-curvature characteristics, based on the models, of the latter plated RC sections are then presented, using the preexisting strains considered at the design stage. The results confirm that both the ductility and strength of plated sections are appreciably sensitive to preexisting strains. It is concluded that existing approaches for design of plating for RC members should take cognizance of these potentially debilitating effects of preexisting strains.

AB - According to many code requirements for concrete structures, the stress in the compressed part of reinforced concrete (RC) beams in bending is usually computed by means of uniaxial stress-strain relationships. These approaches sometimes are not able to reproduce the structural response of the beam when crushing of concrete in compression occurs. As a consequence, both the bearing capacity of RC structures and their ductility are roughly estimated. In this paper, the postpeak behavior of compressed concrete is modeled through sliding planes up to the expulsion of v-shaped block. The concrete damage on the surface of these-planes is the cause of the softening branch in the moment-curvature diagrams of RC beams. The proposed mathematical description of the sliding phenomenon also shows how it is impossible to define an univocal stress-strain relationship for concrete in compression, whose softening behavior depends both on the dimension of the compressive zone and on strain gradient (i.e., the curvature).

AB - A three-dimensional nonlinear finite-element analysis, based on a two-parameters damage model, has been carried out to study the behavior of two masonry vaults: a cylindrical barrel vault and a ribbed cross vault, for which the results of experimental tests were available. Such an approach, originally developed for concrete, reveals to be valuable in understanding the global behavior of masonry structures as well. In particular the numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data, both in terms of collapse mechanism (crack pattern) and failure load, demonstrating the ability of the proposed approach in analyzing large real structures. Within this approach, masonry is treated as a homogenized material, for which the material characteristics can be defined by using a homogenization technique as well as a micromodeling approach. The damage laws take into account for different behavior in tension and compression and have been validated with reference to available experimental data.

AB - In this paper, a finite element analysis technique is presented for the path-dependent nonlinear failure analysis of reinforced concrete shell structures. A so-called pressure node is added into a layered shell element utilizing in-plane constitutive models of reinforced concrete and layered formulation in the failure analysis. By controlling the volume of the shell structures using the pressure node, postpeak softening behavior after the ultimate load of the shell structures is obtained. Since the constitutive models cover loading, unloading, and reloading paths, the element is capable of predicting the behaviors of reinforced concrete shells under cyclic loading. For verification of the techniques in this paper, failure analyses of reinforced concrete slabs subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane loads and cyclic transverse loads are performed and numerical results are compared with experimental data. In addition, reinforced concrete dome structures designed with different reinforcement ratios are also analyzed to check the applicability of the technique in this paper. Results show that the techniques can be applied effectively to the failure analysis of various types of reinforced concrete shell structures.

AB - A critical review of methods for critical excitation (worst-case input) is presented to enhance the robustness of structural design of aerospace, mechanical, and civil engineering structures. These structures are often subjected to disturbances including inherent uncertainties due mainly to their occurrence scarcity and worst-case analysis is expected to play an important role in avoiding difficulties induced by such uncertainties. During the last three decades, various critical excitation methods have been proposed extensively and applied to some structural design problems, mainly for important structures of which the failure or collapse must be absolutely avoided. Comparison of the critical responses with the corresponding structural responses to recorded ground motions, deterministic or stochastic treatment, elastic or elastic-plastic responses, system-dependent critical excitations are major subjects of discussion.

AB - Damage assessment algorithms based on the system identification (SI) method are examined through laboratory experiments. The SI method considered herein identifies structural parameters in a finite-element model by minimizing the error between measured and analytically computed responses. A regularization scheme is applied to alleviate the ill-posedness of an inverse problem by adding a regularization function to the primary error function. Two different algorithms depending on the type of measured response have been developed to assess damage. Static displacements from static loading and modal data from impact vibration were measured through laboratory experiments on a grid-type model bridge. The baseline structural model and baseline properties are determined with experimental data obtained from the tests on the undamaged model structure. Damage is simulated by saw cutting the cross section with various depths and identified as the reduction in the structural stiffness of the elements around the crack. Through the experimental works, the applicability of the SI-based damage assessment algorithms has been rigorously investigated.

AB - A novel sandwich elastica arch is made by buckling its individual layers into shape, and then laminating them in place. One single-layer arch and four prototype sandwich composite arches with aluminum skins and discrete cores of balsa or oak wood were tested. Sandwich composite section resulted in a significant increase in the strength-to-weight ratio of the arch. The spacing of the core and the interlaminar shear strength are shown to affect the mode of failure and capacity of the arch. Test results and the relative ease of fabrication suggest that this novel arch can be used as a skeletal system for large clear-span domes.
