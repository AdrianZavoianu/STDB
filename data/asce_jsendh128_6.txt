AB - Special structures are landmarks and testimonials to the achievements of the structural engineering profession. They are true three-dimensional representations of our equilibrium equations and affirmations of our analytical techniques, design standards and construction practices. They include many types of structures, such as: space frames or grids; cable-and-strut and tensegrity; air-supported or air-inflated; self-erecting and deployable; cable net; tension membrane; lightweight geodesic domes; folded plates; and thin shells. This work celebrates the ASCE’s sesquicentennial by providing a historical perspective on how special structures have evolved, their state-of-practice in the dawn of the 21st century, and a projection of their potential trends and evolution into the future.

AB - Trapezoidal steel box girders are often used in curved bridges due to the large torsional stiffness that results from the closed cross section. However, the torsional loading on the box girders can cause the cross section to distort from its original shape, which results in distortional stresses in the plates of the box section. The distortional stresses are controlled by internal cross frames that restrain the cross section from distortion. Current design specifications do not account for forces in the bracing members due to box girder distortion. This paper presents an analytical study on the distortional behavior of box girders with a trapezoidal cross-sectional shape. Typical torsional loads on curved box girders are discussed, and the distortional components of these applied torsional loads are studied. The distortional components from different torsional loads on trapezoidal box girders are identified and used to derive expressions for the brace forces in the internal cross frames for quasi-closed box girders. The results from the approximate equations for brace forces due to cross-sectional distortion are verified by three-dimensional finite-element analyses.

AB - Arches are often connected with other members, which induce elastic restraining actions during the flexural-torsional buckling of the arch and so increase its elastic buckling resistance. This paper presents a study of the effects of elastic discrete restraints on the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of arches in uniform bending and in uniform compression. It is found that the established results for the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of restrained beams in uniform bending cannot be used directly for restrained arches in uniform bending, nor can those for the elastic flexural or torsional buckling of restrained columns in uniform compression be used directly for restrained arches in uniform compression. Because of the curved profile of an arch, the restraints are more effective in increasing the elastic buckling resistance of an arch than that of the corresponding straight member. Approximate formulas for the threshold values of the stiffness of the central torsional and lateral-translational restraints for a restrained arch in uniform bending and for the threshold value of the stiffness of the lateral-translational restraints for a restrained arch in uniform compression at which the flexural-torsional buckling mode changes from being symmetric to antisymmetric are proposed. Approximate formulas for the elastic flexural-torsional buckling resistance of centrally or end restrained arches in uniform bending and in uniform compression are also proposed. Finite element results demonstrate that these proposed formulas are accurate.

AB - The paper presents design and numerical investigations into the strengths and behavior of cold-formed lipped channel columns using finite element analysis. A nonlinear finite element model is developed and verified against fixed-ended channel column tests. Geometric and material nonlinearities were included in the finite element model. It is demonstrated that the finite element model closely predicted the experimental ultimate loads and the behavior of the cold-formed channel columns. Hence the model was used for an extensive parametric study of cross-section geometries. The column strengths obtained from the finite element analysis are compared with the design column strengths calculated using the American, Australian/New Zealand, and European specifications for cold-formed steel structures. The fixed-ended columns are designed as concentrically loaded compression members. Design column curves obtained from the three specifications are plotted. It is shown that the design column strengths calculated from the three specifications are generally conservative for lipped channels having a maximum plate thickness of 6.0 mm. The reliability of the column strengths is evaluated using reliability analysis.

AB - This paper presents an experimental investigation of cold-formed steel channels with complex stiffeners subjected to pure axial compression for fixed-ended columns. The complex stiffeners of the channel sections consist of simple lips with return lips. A total of 30 column specimens were tested. The specimens were brake pressed from high strength zinc-coated structural steel sheets. Four different cross sections with different flange slenderness were tested over a range of column lengths. Detailed measurements of material properties, geometric imperfections, and local buckling loads of the specimens were conducted. Interaction of local and overall buckling was observed in the tests. Failure modes include local buckling, distortional buckling, and flexural–torsional buckling. The test strengths of the columns are compared with the design strengths predicted by the American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. Design column curves are also plotted. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the American Specification are generally unconservative for short and intermediate columns, whereas the design strengths predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard are generally conservative for all column lengths. This is because the Australian/New Zealand Standard has a separate check for distortional buckling of singly symmetric sections.

AB - This paper describes a series of tests on empty and void-filled rectangular hollow section (RHS) braces subjected to static and cyclic axial loading. The braces were made from cold-formed C450 (450 MPa nominal yield stress) RHS with two different plate slenderness ratios. The filler material used was normal concrete and light-weight concrete. Two loading protocols were applied, namely Cyclic-Direct (full axial displacement applied and load oscillated) and Cyclic-Incremental (load oscillated at several accumulating axial displacement increments). First-cycle buckling loads were compared with design loads predicted using various national standards. The effects of filler material and section slenderness on the load-deflection response, first cycle peak load, postpeak residual strength, ductility, and energy absorption of void-filled RHS braces are studied in the paper. The effect of the loading scheme is also discussed.

AB - A series of tests consisting of three cross-section geometries was performed on cold-formed stainless steel circular hollow section (CHS) columns compressed between fixed ends. The specimens were cold rolled from stainless steel sheets. The tests were performed over a range of column lengths, which involved local buckling and overall flexural buckling. Measurements of overall geometric imperfections and material properties were conducted. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths predicted using the American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for cold-formed stainless steel structures as well as the column strengths obtained from the design rules proposed by Rasmussen and Hancock in 1993 and Rasmussen and Rondal in 1997. Generally, the specifications unconservatively predict the strengths of the tested CHS columns, while Rasmussen and Hancock; and Rasmussen and Rondal conservatively predict the column strengths. The reliability of these design rules is evaluated using reliability analysis.

AB - Three fiber-reinforced polymer deck-to-girder connection concepts were evaluated for longitudinal structural capacity, ease of erection, and affordability. The first two concepts employed a composite sleeve to confine grout around three shear studs. In both cases, failure was due to a loss of confinement and local crushing of the composite. As a result, a connection that contained a larger volume of grout to alleviate local crushing and steel spirals to aid in grout confinement was developed by Cassity et al. in 2000. This connection detail utilizes a trapezoidal cell of the deck’s core to confine grout around three shear studs. Following the strength tests on this connection it was fatigued according to AASHTO specifications for 10.5 million cycles (75-year design life) and tested for residual capacity. The connection survived fatigue loading with negligible loss in stiffness. The haunch exhibited minimal debonding and cracking. Connection capacity after one lifetime of fatigue was within 2% of initial capacity and exceeded strength limit state requirements for a specific bridge.

AB - When crest-fixed thin steel roof and wall cladding systems are subjected to wind uplift or suction loading, local pull-through or pull-out failures occur prematurely at their screwed connections. During high wind events such as storms and hurricanes these localized failures then lead to severe damage to buildings and their contents. In recent times, the use of thin steel battens/purlins has increased considerably. This has made the pull-out failures more critical in the design of steel cladding systems. Recent research has developed a design formula for the static pull-out strength of screwed connections in steel cladding systems. However, the effects of fluctuating wind uplift or suction loading that occurs during high wind events are not known. Therefore, a series of cyclic wind uplift/suction tests has been undertaken on connections between thin steel battens made of different thicknesses and steel grades, and screw fasteners with varying diameter and pitch. Tests revealed a significant reduction to pull-out strength caused by fluctuating wind loading. Simple design equations and suitable recommendations were developed to take into account this strength reduction. This paper presents the details of the cyclic tests and the results.

AB - This study consists of an analytical examination of the behavior of a stiffened plate with a hole when subjected to cyclic axial forces, and an investigation of the effect of the doubling plate reinforcement method. Parametric nonlinear finite element analysis is carried out with isoparametric shell elements with four nodal points, two surface models as constitutive laws, and an incremental method based on an updated Lagrangian method. This parametric analysis reveals that the ultimate strength of a perforated stiffened plate with or without reinforcement can be estimated using a modification of the formula for a nonperforated stiffened plate. It is notable that doubling plate reinforcement increases the ultimate strength but barely reduces the deterioration of postpeak strength and also that increasing the stiffness ratio of the stiffener effectively enhances the strength and deformation capacity of the perforated stiffened plate.

AB - Most international codes and standards provide guidelines and procedures for assessing the along-wind effects on tall structures. Despite their common use of the “gust loading factor” (GLF) approach, sizeable scatter exists among the wind effects predicted by the various codes and standards under similar flow conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the source of this scatter through a comparison of the along-wind loads and their effects on tall buildings recommended by major international codes and standards. ASCE 7-98 (United States), AS1170.2-89 (Australia), NBC-1995 (Canada), RLB-AIJ-1993 (Japan), and Eurocode-1993 (Europe) are examined in this study. The comparisons consider the definition of wind characteristics, mean wind loads, GLF, equivalent static wind loads, and attendant wind load effects. It is noted that the scatter in the predicted wind loads and their effects arises primarily from the variations in the definition of wind field characteristics in the respective codes and standards. A detailed example is presented to illustrate the overall comparison and to highlight the main findings of this paper.

AB - The shear modulus of the elastomer is the most important material property related to the behavior of elastomeric bearings used principally at supports in bridges. Current methods for determining the shear modulus usually require small test samples cut from manufactured bearings. Such tests are costly, do not necessarily represent the performance of the full-size bearing, and are destructive. A new shear test method, called the inclined compression test, is reported that is nondestructive and only requires a compression test machine to apply shear to the full-size bearing. The results from the inclined compression test show good correlation with results from an independent full-scale test setup. To develop reliable test procedures various test parameters were evaluated such as testing speed, platen surface conditions, and specimen dimensions. The test results show that the inclined compression method is a practical alternative to more traditional test methods. The new method works very well on bearings reinforced with steel laminates, but plain bearings require cold bonding to attachment plates in order to obtain reliable shear moduli.

AB - Fully stressed design is an optimization heuristic that is widely practiced for member sizing of frame structures. When performed iteratively, such as with the stress-ratio method, it usually converges rapidly and yields a reasonable structural design. A previous paper has demonstrated that some frame structures are capable of being proportioned in many different ways, each of which is a distinct fully stressed design with a unique load path. Furthermore, many of these fully stressed designs are unstable fixed points under the stress-ratio iteration, and are consequently unobtainable by conventional methodology. This paper relates this behavior to Hardy Cross’s notion of normal, hybrid, and participatory action. Parameter studies reveal that certain combinations of lateral-to-gravity load ratios and height-to-width ratios tend to produce a greater multiplicity of fully stressed designs. The multiple designs are classified according to eight commonly observed material distribution patterns, and their load paths are examined. The eight structural types are shown to have relative advantages in terms of material economy and resistance to sidesway. Practical construction-related issues are addressed by linking the sizes of multiple members through a common design variable.

AB - Conventional trial-and-error methods are not efficient in developing appropriate strut-and-tie models in complex structural concrete members. This paper describes a performance-based optimization (PBO) technique for automatically producing optimal strut-and-tie models for the design and detailing of structural concrete. The PBO algorithm utilizes the finite element method as a modeling and analytical tool. Developing strut-and-tie models in structural concrete is treated as an optimal topology design problem of continuum structures. The optimal strut-and-tie model that idealizes the load transfer mechanism in cracked structural concrete is generated by gradually removing regions that are ineffective in carrying loads from a structural concrete member based on overall stiffness performance criteria. A performance index is derived for evaluating the performance of strut-and-tie systems in an optimization process. Fundamental concepts underlying the development of strut-and-tie models are introduced. Design examples of a low-rise concrete shearwall with openings and a bridge pier are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the PBO technique as a rational and reliable design tool for structural concrete.

AB - Load duration behavior, arising from creep rupture, is one of the most significant effects distinguishing wood materials from other structural materials. The phenomenon of creep rupture has been widely studied over the past 2 decades. Recent experimental programs have focused on duration-of-load (DOL) effects in full-size lumber and a number of different cumulative damage models have been proposed. These models have been used in reliability analyses that take into account the stochastic nature of the loading process to evaluate appropriate load duration adjustment factors for use in design. More recently, the stochastic damage accumulation process itself has been investigated. This has resulted in proposals for simplified cumulative damage analyses and the re-emergence of the “killer pulse” concept for load duration effects in wood. The evolution of the new LRFD standard for wood provides a good opportunity to revisit this important issue. This paper will briefly review DOL research, with particular emphasis on the work used as the basis for the time effects factors in the LRFD standard, and describe a simplified approach to cumulative damage analysis using order statistics. It is shown that reliability analyses including DOL behavior can be performed more simply (efficiently) using an order statistics approach or even a simple first order reliability method analysis. Thus, it may be possible to evaluate load duration factors for design without having to perform complex stochastic cumulative damage analyses.

AB - The severe damage to beam-column steel connections in the Northridge and Kobe earthquakes generated concerns about the reliability of current steel structural design. Development of effective measures to strengthen the connection is crucial and urgent. In this paper, streamline theory was applied to connection geometry optimization, with emphasis on its application to the access hole. By evaluating the fracture proneness at critical points in the connection, the validity of the streamline connection geometry optimization design is demonstrated.

AB - This paper deals with the development of simple, yet accurate design formulas for elastic stability of finite plates, simply supported and reinforced with multiple equidistant stiffeners, under shear. Several stiffener arrangements are considered. In each case, the plate aspect ratio is varied over a practical range for stiffened plates to be used as shear-type hysteretic dampers for building and civil engineering structures. The buckling coefficients are determined by means of the elastic buckling theory, considering both symmetric and antisymmetric buckling configurations. The obtained numerical results are employed in the developments of approximate formulas for the buckling coefficient and optimum rigidity of the stiffener. The computed optimum rigidities are compared with the results available in the literature. It is apparent that all of the proposed formulas can be used precisely to fulfill the need in design of shear-type hysteretic dampers as well as general stiffened plates in shear.
