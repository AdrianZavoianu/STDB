AB - An approximate method is presented to estimate the maximum lateral drift demands in multistory buildings with nonuniform lateral stiffness responding primarily in the fundamental mode when subjected to earthquake ground motions. The method is aimed at the estimation of the maximum roof displacement and of the maximum interstory drift ratio for a given response spectrum. A simplified model of the multistory building is used based on an equivalent continuum structure with nonuniform lateral stiffness distribution consisting of a combination of a flexural cantilever beam and a shear cantilever beam. The effect of the type and amount of reduction in lateral stiffness along the height of the building and of the ratio of overall flexural and shear deformations on the ratio of the spectral displacement to the roof displacement and on the ratio of the maximum interstory drift ratio to the roof drift ratio is investigated. It is shown that reductions in lateral stiffness along the height have a negligible effect on the ratio of spectral displacement to maximum roof displacement and only a small effect on the ratio of maximum interstory drift ratio to roof drift ratio. The use of the method is exemplified with a ten-story steel moment-resisting frame building with nonuniform lateral stiffness. Results computed with the simplified method are compared with those computed using linear and nonlinear time history analyses. It is shown that the method provides good approximations that are adequate for the preliminary design of new buildings or for a rapid evaluation of existing buildings.

AB - Nine large-scale subassembly tests were conducted to investigate the behavior of an innovative posttensioned wide flange beam-to-column connection for steel moment resisting frames subjected to seismic loading conditions. The connection includes top and seat angles bolted to the beam and column. Strands are placed along the length of the beam, passing through the column and  posttensioned to provide a precompression of the beam against the column. The parameters investigated in the study include the angle thickness, angle gage length, beam flange reinforcing plates, connection shim plates, and posttensioning force. The test results demonstrate that posttensioned connections provide excellent elastic stiffness, strength, and ductility under cyclic loading, with energy dissipation occurring primarily in the angles. The connection initial elastic stiffness is comparable to that of a fully restrained welded connection. In addition, the connection has essentially no residual deformation following several cycles of inelastic story drift. Simple design models are developed and verified by the test results for estimating the connection decompression moment and moment capacity, as well as the increase in posttensioning strand force due to connection deformation.

AB - Pounding between adjacent frames in a multiple-frame bridge produces undesirable forces resulting in large displacements, local damage, and possible failure of column bents. In this study, analytical models are used to examine the factors affecting the global response of a multiple-frame bridge due to pounding of adjacent frames. Parameter studies of one-sided and two-sided pounding are conducted to determine the effects of frame stiffness ratio, ground motion characteristics, frame yielding, and restrainers on the pounding response of bridge frames. It is determined that the most important parameters are the frame period ratio and the characteristic period of the ground motion. The amplification in the frame response due to one-sided pounding is most severe for cases with highly out-of-phase frames, in particular for short period structures. Two-sided pounding amplifies the stiff frame response, and reduces the flexible frame response. The addition of restrainers has a minor effect on the one-sided pounding response of highly out-of-phase frames. Current recommendations by Caltrans for limitations in frame period ratios to reduce the effects of pounding are evaluated through an example case.

AB - The essential properties of sliding isolators used for earthquake resistant design are period shift, energy dissipation, and the restoring mechanism. Isolation systems using a curved surface incorporate all of these in a single unit. The systems currently available have limitations due to their period and restoring force characteristics. The writers have recently proposed a new isolator called the variable frequency pendulum isolator (VFPI), which overcomes these limitations while retaining the advantages. The oscillation frequency of the VFPI continuously decreases with increase in sliding displacement, and the restoring force has an upper bound so that the force transmitted to the structure is bounded. The mathematical formulation for the response of multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structures isolated using the VFPI has been discussed in this paper. Parametric studies have been carried out to examine the behavior of MDOF structures and structure-equipment systems isolated with the VFPI, friction pendulum system, and pure friction isolator. The VFPI performance is found to be effective and stable during low- and medium-intensity excitations, and fail-safe during high-intensity excitations. The VFPI is also found to exhibit robust performance for a wide range of isolator and ground motion characteristics, clearly demonstrating its advantages for vibration control of MDOF structures.

AB - Design of infilled frames to resist lateral loads on buildings in terms of their failure modes, failure loads, and initial stiffnesses using procedures proposed by previous authors is verified. This verification is made by comparing the results of the analytical procedures of the previous authors with those of a new finite element model for infilled frames, which are verified using experimental results. To model the interface between the frame and the infill and the mortar joints surrounding the blocks of masonry, a nonassociated interface models is formulated using the available test data on masonry joints. The failure criteria for masonry include the von Mises criterion for the plane stress condition for uncracked masonry (assembly) and a smeared crack model. Additionally, the finite element model provided more insights into the failure mechanisms of the infilled frames.

AB - The paper aims at evaluating the relative accuracy of different models, mainly intended for use by practicing engineers, for the analysis of unreinforced masonry buildings, and to determine whether, and under what conditions, a simple equivalent frame model can be used for design and/or assessment purposes. Several parametric analyses involving finite element (FE) models of two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures have been performed, first in the elastic range, using both refined and coarse planar meshes. They were followed by analyses of the same structures using equivalent frames with alternative arrangements of rigid offsets. Subsequently, two-dimensional nonlinear static (pushover) analyses of both FE and equivalent frame models were performed to check the validity of the conclusions drawn from the elastic analysis. The results presented herein shed some further light on the feasibility of using simplified and cost-effective analytical models as a tool for practical design and/or assessment of typical masonry structures.

AB - Eight shear wall specimens sheathed with 11 mm structural oriented strand board panels were assembled with overdriven sheathing nails and tested using a pseudo-dynamic procedure. Specimens used 38×89 mm Douglas Fir-Larch framing members and 8d cooler, gun-driven sheathing nails. Four overdriven nail depths were considered: flush, 1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 mm. Nails were spaced at 76 mm on center along the edges and 305 mm on center along intermediate supports. Edge nailing distance was 9.5 mm. Two specimens were constructed for each aforementioned overdriven depth. To determine a lower bound on capacity, 100% of the sheathing nails in a specimen were driven to the specified depth. Results from this study indicate that any level of sheathing-nail overdrive will reduce the capacity of a shear wall. Compared to specimens with flush-driven nails, specimens with nails overdriven 1.6 mm suffered 5% loss in strength and gained 1% in displacement capacity. Specimens with nails overdriven 3.2 mm had strength and displacement capacity reduced by 12 and 22%, respectively. Specimens with nails overdriven 4.8 mm fared poorly; strength was reduced 24%, and displacement capacity was reduced 56%.

AB - In the design of a floor panel decking by calculation, the mechanical properties and theories of failure of the panel are used to determine the decking’s load capacity and stiffness. In this paper, the calculated and measured short-term concentrated load capacities and stiffnesses of one-way oriented strand board (OSB) panels, each loaded at the center of the span, are compared. Typical load capacities and stiffnesses are obtained from tests of simply supported OSB panels with ratios of span to thickness of 16.7 and 33.3. A punching shear-type failure characterized the failure mode of the panels. The calculated stiffnesses based on the panels’ elastic properties compare favorably with the experimentally determined stiffnesses. However, the calculated load capacities determined from the bending moduli of rupture and theories of failure in bending seriously underestimate the panels’ load capacities. A bending–punching shear interaction equation is proposed that enables the calculation of acceptable estimates of the load capacities. The results suggest that a bending–punching shear equation rather than a pure bending equation is needed for reliable calculation of the load capacities.

AB - The purpose of this experimental research program was to verify that the transfer and development length of 15-mm (0.6-in.) diameter prestressing strand were less than calculated by the current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Specifications when used in high performance concrete bridge girders. The scope was limited to testing four AASHTO Type II girders, two made from 70 MPa and two from 100 MPa design strength concretes. Transfer length was determined by measuring strand end slip and concrete surface strain. Development length was determined by performing eight flexure tests with varying embedment lengths. Transfer length averaged 447 mm (17.6 in.) and 371 mm (14.6 in.) for the 70 and 100 MPa concretes, respectively. The development length was found to be 2032 mm (80 in.). These values were less than those given by the current AASHTO and ACI code provisions; therefore it is recommended that current code provisions be used for pretensioned concrete girders with strengths up to 100 MPa.

AB - A semianalytical method to predict the behavior of in-filled columns is presented in this paper. Moment-curvature-thrust relationships are generated for column cross sections by an iterative process. Nonlinear equilibrium equations resulting from geometric and material nonlinearities are solved by an incremental-iterative numerical scheme based on the generalized displacement control method. Square, rectangular, and circular cross sections of compact steel tubes filled with concrete are considered in the analysis. The columns are pin-ended and subjected to uniaxial or biaxial loading. The accuracy of the proposed analytical method is established by comparing the results with the corresponding experimental values.

AB - One of the structural design aspects of most liners is to check their stability under external uniform pressures. For liners made from elastoplastic materials, inelastic stability should be considered. Any gap between the liner and its host will allow the liner to deform more freely than a tightly fitted liner, leading to a lower elastic or inelastic critical pressure. This paper uses the finite element method to study the effect of the liner’s thickness-to-diameter, gap- to-diameter, and yield stress–to–Young’s modulus ratios on its critical pressure and compares the results to the commonly used Jacobsen solution. The study defines also the type of liner buckling (i.e., elastic or inelastic) based on the values of the previously mentioned parameters. The results of this study are finally used to produce a series of charts that estimate the critical pressure of such loosely fitted liners. These charts represent a new tool that can be used in the design of liners.

AB - This technical note explores the physical and mathematical basis for the drift demand spectrum proposed in the 1990's by Iwan, and reveals several unexpected features of the original mathematical formulation. It is shown that the solution presented by Iwan does not provide the drift response of an isolated uniform shearbeam; instead, the solution corresponds to an analytical model in which the cantilevered shearbeam is attached to external springs and dampers anchored to a fixed reference point. Two alternative mathematical formulations are presented based on more realistic analytical models, and the results are compared with those obtained by Iwan's formulation. Advantages and disadvantages of all three formulations are discussed.

AB - Structural design requires a knowledge of the displacements and stress resultants occurring in a structure so that the designer can be satisfied that all functional requirements and design constraints are met. It is usual to base the first analysis on an initial design and then review the design constraints and make any desirable changes in the design data. If we continue this process we encounter a circular operation of repeated design and analysis. The process is handicapped by the dissimilar computational natures of analysis and design making integration difficult. A neural network type of computational device is suitable for continuous updating of the analysis with provision for a wide range of structural design modifications including those affecting geometry, topology, nodes, loads, supports, and material properties. The convenience in reanalysis introduced will generally require more memory in the computer and faster processing compared with the conventional approach. The practicality of the method is justified by the remarkable increases in processing speeds and memory capacities of modern computers.

AB - In the case of mechanical structures joined by bolts and nuts, many studies have been conducted on the stiffness of the joined members. Accordingly, an appropriate formula for this case has already been formulated and verified by experimentation. However, the case of joined members with a sleeve, which is a common situation in civil engineering, has not yet been considered. Consequently, an elastic closed-form solution is derived for evaluating the stiffness of bolted-joint members with a sleeve, the material of which is different from the joined members. The proposed formula is then verified by an experiment and finite element method. And then it is used to calculate member stiffness in a concrete structure. The results confirm that the proposed formula can be effectively used to calculate the stiffness of joined members with a sleeve, particularly when predicting the fatigue failure of a bolt under fluctuating loads.

AB - A methodology is developed in this paper to evaluate the first transition foundation stiffness for columns subjected to end concentrated loads, on a Winkler foundation, where the buckling mode shape changes. The method is based on earlier work of Naidu and Rao to predict the fundamental frequency of beam columns, wherein it was assumed that the mode shapes of vibration, initially loaded vibration, and buckling are the same. Very good predictions for the fundamental frequency of beam columns were obtained when the assumption of the same mode shapes is satisfied. In the case of the buckling of columns on Winkler foundations, at a certain value of the foundation stiffness the buckling mode shape totally changes while the mode shapes of vibration and initially loaded vibration remain the same. This led to a very large error in the predicted fundamental frequency parameter of the beam columns. This aspect is used in the present paper to evaluate the first transition foundation modulus of columns of Winkler foundations. The first transition foundation stiffness for simply supported columns on Winkler foundations, for which an exact solution is available, is obtained through the proposed methodology, and is found to be very accurate when compared to the literature values. The methodology is further used to find the first transition foundation modulus of clamped columns for which no solution is readily available. Very interesting and unexpected results were obtained for the transition stiffness and the corresponding mode shapes at transition for clamped columns of Winkler foundations.
