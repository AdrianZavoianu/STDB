AB - The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the developments in structural engineering that took place during the past century. This overview includes (1) some of the major structural accomplishments as selected by the writers, (2) the advances in mechanics as the basis of structural analysis, (3) the development of new materials, (4) new fields of research and practice, and (5) the changes in the way design projects are performed. In addition, the writers’ personal predictions for future developments during the 21st century are also presented. One of the main features affecting the evolution of structural engineering over the last part of the 20th century has been the advent and rapid development of digital computers as engineering tools. Computers can be used to perform complex and cumbersome computations and to enhance worldwide communications, both with great speed and reliability. This has already had an important effect on the way we design structures and educate civil engineers, but the impact on structural analysis and design as well as on construction planning and management is still in progress. We believe that this impact will be fully felt in the 21st century. Computers will liberate engineers from tedious and routine computations, allowing them to concentrate on more creative and important endeavors. They will facilitate the design of constructed facilities as complete systems rather than by considering each subsystem (such as structure and foundation) separately. They will lead finally to the needed integration of the design and construction processes.

AB - Tension members consisting of single and double angles, single channels, and similar sections are frequently used for lateral bracing and as truss elements. Such members will normally have eccentric connections, and it is often permitted by current design specifications, to neglect this eccentricity in the design of the member. In this paper, load tests were performed on three series of short tension member specimens to investigate the influence of varying connection eccentricity and length on the load capacity of the members. Rupture load capacity of the net section was observed to be significantly reduced with moderate connection eccentricity, and a net section efficiency factor is developed and proposed as a replacement for the current shear lag factor in determining the effective net area of a tension member.

AB - Experimental research was conducted to investigate the performance of elastomeric bridge bearings at low temperatures. Full-size natural rubber and neoprene bearings were tested by specially designed test setups inside a walk-in-type environmental chamber. Steel laminated bearings were ordered with two specified shear modulus, 0.69 and 1.08 MPa. Tests were conducted at 23, −10, −20, and −30°C for a period of 21 days. The effect of cyclic compression, cyclic shear, rate of loading, type of elastomer compound, temperature history, creep, and slip coefficient on the performance was investigated. Approximately 500 shear stiffness tests were performed. Results indicated that the increase in shear stiffness at low temperature is a function of elastomer compound, temperature, and time. In addition, rate of loading, amplitude of strain, coefficient of friction, and temperature history were identified as important parameters that influence the bearing performance. Creep behavior at low temperature was significantly different from creep at room temperature but had no significant influence on the overall performance. It was shown that cyclic compression force and cyclic shear strain do not have significant influence on time-dependent stiffening (crystallization) of bearings. The results of this paper were used to develop a performance-based evaluation and acceptance criterion that is presented in a companion paper.

AB - Recent studies on elastomeric bearings led to changes in the design specifications, which tend to indicate that bearings fabricated in the past, would fail the current test requirements. This is contrary to the fact that there have been no reported problems of poor bearing performance in low-temperature regions. AASHTO requires low-temperature tests to determine the change in the shear modulus, which is limited to a certain value. This criterion does not adequately address the performance of the bearings, because in-service conditions of an elastomeric bearing are not sufficiently taken into account. The field performance of the bearings depends primarily on the temperature characteristics of the geographic location where the bearing is installed, which also determines the probable amplitude of shear strain the bearing would experience. Thus, to adequately evaluate the in-service performance of the bearings, a performance-based procedure should be employed. In this paper, a variety of bearings were tested and checked at four different low-temperature locations. The test results have been reported in a companion paper. It was established that most of the bearings could in fact serve satisfactorily in spite of the fact that the bearings in many instances fail the current test procedures. This indicates that the current testing requirements related to cold-temperature performance are too severe. Hence, a procedure that relies on the historic temperature records of the region where the bearing would be installed is recommended to determine the performance requirements at a particular location. In this procedure, the acceptance criterion is based on the maximum expected shear force and the potential slip of the bearings.

AB - Fracture experiments at room temperature on full-scale specimens fabricated from relatively thin plates of HSLA-80 and EH-36 ship steel consistently show the development of the plastic limit load on the net section and ductility greater than times yield strain, despite large fatigue cracks. A limit-load analysis can accurately predict the load at any point in the deformation if the crack length is known. Predicting crack extension using a constant crack-opening angle is a simple and reasonably accurate approach. The difficulty is in predicting the onset of extension after the development of strain localization. A simple approach using conventional small-strain finite-element analysis and a special “necking” stress–strain curve that is calibrated from conventional tensile test data is proposed. This approach gives very good predictions of the onset and propagation of ductile tears, including the spread of plasticity to the gross section.

AB - The Trans-Tokyo Bay Highway Crossing, completed in 1997, is 11 km in total length and is a combined tunnel and multiple bridge route that includes a ten-span continuous steel box-girder bridge with a total length of 1,630 m. The two longest spans of this bridge measure 240 m, and the highway consists of four lanes with an overall width of 22.9 m. In this bridge, significant vibration due to vortex shedding was observed under prevailing winds almost transverse to the bridge axis. This vortex-induced first-mode vibration peaked at a wind velocity around 16–17 m/s, with a maximum amplitude exceeding 50 cm. This paper describes the vortex-induced vibration that occurred in these particular spans, together with the extensive number of wind tunnel tests that were conducted before and after the bridge construction. It is shown that the results from the field and from the wind tunnel tests are fairly consistent regarding the amplitudes and wind speed range of the vortex-induced vibration in the first vertical vibrational mode of the bridge. The TMDs developed specifically to control first and second vertical flexural modes of this bridge and aerodynamic vibration controls employed for higher modes are also explained.

AB - Critical issues related to damage and condition assessment are discussed. The distinction between global and local state properties, linearized and nonlinear condition indices and experimental constraints are discussed along with a classification of condition assessment techniques. Brief examples from research results on steel stringer highway bridges and a long span bridge are presented in order to exemplify the interrelation between structural condition, damage, and some of the promising damage indices. The indices that are discussed in this paper are influence coefficients for displacement and strain, and redistribution of intrinsic strains measured by continuous long term monitoring. A discussion of these indices is introduced with application examples from the bridges, which were utilized as a test bed to evaluate the applicability of the indices. Tools and technologies for successful measurement of influence coefficients are presented. It is shown that if a spectrum of appropriate experiments and indices are integrated within a structural identification framework, and the structure is monitored for a sufficiently long time, it is possible to accomplish successful condition and damage assessment.

AB - The paper presented herein investigates the ability of an adaptive seismic isolation system to protect structures subjected to disparate earthquake ground motions. The isolation system consists of sliding isolation bearings in combination with an adaptive hydraulic damper. The damping capacity of the hydraulic damper can be modified in real time to respond to the effects that the earthquake ground motion has on the structure. An experimental laboratory implementation of the adaptive isolation system within a scale-model building structure is described. Analytical models of the isolation system components and the test structure are developed and calibrated through experimental system identification tests. Results from experimental shaking table tests are then used to validate the results from numerical simulations which utilized the analytical models. Although the adaptive base-isolation system results in a complex nonlinear dynamic system, the analytical predictions agreed reasonably well with the experimental test data. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate that, for both near-field (pulse-type) and far-field earthquake ground motions, an adaptive sliding base isolation system is capable of reducing the interstory drift response of structures while simultaneously limiting the displacement response of the isolation system.

AB - The use of energy as means to derive seismic design forces is discussed in this paper. The energy balance concept used in deriving seismic design forces for single-degree-of-freedom systems is extended and used to derive the design forces for multistory moment frames. The ultimate design forces are derived from input energy for a selected design pseudovelocity spectrum, a selected plastic yield mechanism, and a selected target deformation level. The characteristics of the structure, especially the ductility and the plastic yield mechanism, are explicitly used in calculating the design forces. A practical design procedure that can be used to ensure the formation of the selected yield mechanism is then briefly presented. The design procedure is based on conventional plastic design concept with some modifications. The energy concept proposed in this paper is then used to design six example steel moment frames. The results from dynamic analyses of these frames were used to evaluate the procedure. The results indicate that the procedure presented in this paper can be used as a viable alternative to current design procedures, and within the framework of performance based design philosophy.

AB - This paper presents research on the behavior of a type of building popular in high seismic zones with a lateral-load-resisting system consisting of masonry-infilled reinforced concrete (RC) frames. Older buildings of this type typically were designed for gravity loads in combination with insufficient or no lateral loads, therefore they do not meet current seismic code requirements. Also, the participation of infill panels in the lateral load resistance of RC frames was not recognized in the original design, often resulting in an overly conservative design. In an attempt to determine the seismic vulnerability of this type of structure, an experimental program was carried out to evaluate the behavior of five half-scale, single-story laboratory models with different numbers of bays. The results indicated that infilled RC frames exhibit significantly higher ultimate strength, residual strength, and initial stiffness than bare frames without compromising any ductility in the load–deflection response. Furthermore, the number of bays appears to be influential with respect to the peak and residual capacity, the failure mode, and the shear stress distribution.

AB - A simplified method for the analysis and design of membrane elements subjected to in-plane shearing and normal stresses is presented. The method proposed is capable of calculating the ultimate strength and the mode of failure of membrane elements. The strength curves in the method are also cast in a tabular format to further simplify the method. The results of the proposed method compare well with experimental results of 14 membrane elements reported in the literature and with the results of the modified compression field theory. Comparisons with the general method and the American Concrete Institute code are also presented. Use of the method is illustrated by two examples, one for design and the other for capacity calculation.

AB - In an experimental and analytical study on the mechanical behavior of circular steel–concrete composite stub columns, 13 specimens were tested. To examine different mechanical behaviors of the columns, three loading conditions were studied. Three-dimensional nonlinear finite-element models were established and verified with the experimental results. The analytical models were also used to study how the behavior of the column was influenced by the bond strength between the steel tube and the concrete core and by the confinement of the concrete core offered by the steel tube. The results obtained from the tests and the finite-element analyses showed that the mechanical behavior of the column was greatly influenced by the method used to apply the load to the column section. The bond strength had no influence on the behavior when the steel and concrete section were loaded simultaneously. On the contrary, for the columns with the load applied only to the concrete section, the bond strength highly affected the confinement effects and, consequently, the mechanical behavior of the columns.

AB - One of the major changes in the recent versions of ASCE 7 concerns the introduction of three-second gust as the reference wind speed. The three-second gust speed is derived using Durst’s model in terms of the mean wind speed and turbulence intensity given in the former versions of ASCE 7. A review of these profiles suggests a notable inconsistency in the embedded relationship among the wind profiles in ASCE 7-98, which is also apparent when these are compared to the profiles in major international codes and standards. To overcome this inconsistency in the definition of wind profiles, this paper proposes a modified turbulence intensity profile and suggests retaining the current mean wind and gust speed profiles. This modification not only ensures consistency in the definition of wind profiles in ASCE 7-98, but also renders the definition of these profiles consistent with those in major international codes and standards.

AB - In the second-order reliability method (SORM), the failure probability is generally estimated using a parabolic approximation of a performance function. In the present paper, the moment properties of a second-order approximation of performance functions are investigated, and a moment approximation for a second-order reliability method and a simple second-order third-moment reliability index are proposed for the estimation of failure probability corresponding to both the simple and general parabolic approximations. Based on the property that the parabolic approximation approaches a unit normal random variable, the ranges of three parameters are investigated: the number of variables, the principal curvature, and the first-order reliability index. A simple analytical judgment formula is derived, which can help us judge when the first-order reliability method is sufficiently accurate and when the SORM is required. A simple second-order second-moment reliability index is also proposed for problems with relatively small principal curvatures. Through some numerical examples, the simplicity and accuracy of the second-order second- and third-moment reliability indices are demonstrated.
