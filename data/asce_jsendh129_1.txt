AB - When a beam flange is coped to allow clearance at the connection, the strength of the coped region will be reduced. Local web buckling at the coped region may occur when the cope length is long and/or the compression flange is braced. Experimental and analytical investigation of the strength of coped steel I beams were conducted by a number of researchers and design formula was also proposed. However, the proposed formula underestimates the local web buckling capacity of a coped I beam, especially when the cope-depth to beam-depth ratio is small. To improve this discrepancy, full-scale tests of the web buckling strength of coped steel I beams and a series of analytical studies were carried out. A modified plate buckling formula, which considers the shear buckling phenomenon at the coped region, is proposed. The modified formula gives a better prediction of the local web buckling strength of a coped I beam. The test-to-predicted ratios varies from 0.92 to 1.06.

AB - In steel and concrete composite beams, the incomplete interaction between steel profile and concrete slab leads to an appreciable increase of the beam deflections with respect to full interaction behavior. Moreover, the concrete cracking in hogging moment regions of continuous beams needs to be considered. In this paper, a finite-element procedure considering nonlinear load–slip relationship for shear connectors is presented. Such a procedure accounts for the concrete slab cracking and the resulting tension stiffening effect; it also assumes different load–slip relationships for shear connectors in cracked slab. Some experimental comparisons show the accuracy of the proposed procedure. A wide parametric analysis is performed with reference to the evaluation of deflections for simply supported composite beams. Finally, a simplified method which is able to evaluate deflections for beams with nonlinear behaving shear connection is presented.

AB - A full-scale uniplanar completely overlapped tubular K(N) joint specimen is tested to determine the hot spot strains at the joint intersections for the verification of the finite-element (FE) model. The test results reveal that the maximum strain concentration occurs on the through brace saddle near the lap brace. On the chord, the strain distributions perpendicular to the weld toes are linear but on the through brace and the lap brace, they are nonlinear. Based on the FE analysis results, the effects of through brace and lap brace geometric parameters on the joint stress concentration factors (SCF) are found most crucial. The use of the existing Y-joint formulas has considerably underestimated and overestimated the SCF on the through brace saddle near the chord and the lap brace, respectively. At a relatively large gap size, the SCF values at the joint intersection of the through brace and the lap brace are close to that of the Y joint.

AB - The use of advanced composite materials for rehabilitation of deteriorating infrastructure has been embraced worldwide. The conventional techniques for strengthening of substandard bridges are costly, time consuming, and labor intensive. Many new techniques have used the lightweight, high strength, and the corrosion resistance of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) laminates for repair and retrofit applications. The load-carrying capacity of a steel-concrete composite girder can be improved significantly by epoxy bonding carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) laminates to its tension flange. This paper presents the results of a study on the behavior of steel-concrete composite girders strengthened with CFRP sheets under static loading. A total of three large-scale composite girders made of W355×13.6 A36 steel beam and 75-mm thick by 910-mm wide concrete slab were prepared and tested. The thickness of the CFRP sheet was constant and a different number of layers of 1, 3, and 5 were used in the specimens. The test results showed that epoxy-bonded CFRP sheet increased the ultimate load-carrying capacity of steel-concrete composite girders and the behavior can be conservatively predicted by traditional methods.

AB - In a previous paper, interaction relations based on the lower bound theorem of plasticity were derived for moderately thick pipes subjected to biaxial shear and bending, axial force, twisting moments, and internal or external pressure. The developments provided a lower bound solution based on assumed simplified stress fields. In this paper it is demonstrated that the assumptions made in the previous solution were indeed equilibrium requirements. Pipe interaction relations are obtained using the upper bound theorem of plasticity. Because (1) the assumed strain fields are based on the general solution of the compatibility equations; (2) the stress fields meet the equilibrium conditions; and (3) the yield condition is met over the whole pipe cross section, the interaction relations obtained are exact within the limitations of the formulation. The yield surface obtained meets the Drucker convexity requirement and is suitable as a potential surface characterizing the behavior of generalized plastic hinges in the elastoplastic analysis of pipe elements. The yield surface is mathematically described by two intrinsic functions. A simple mathematical procedure is devised in order to express the normality condition to the yield surface.

AB - Effects of stiffeners on nonlinear buckling and postbuckling behavior of prebuckled and corresponding rigid domes are investigated. A prestressed dome is formed by the buckling of individual flat members by a special erection procedure. During the second stage of construction, flexible or rigid stiffeners in the form of cables or rings, respectively, are attached in the circumferential direction of the erected dome. To compare the buckling phenomena of a prestressed dome against its rigid counterpart, the stress induced during the prebuckling process is initialized to zero stress, to get the corresponding rigid virgin shape. The study shows that both rigid and prestressed domes reach the limit points without showing any bifurcation tendency. The structure snaps through at the limit point and reaches a second peak in the postbuckling range. The study reveals that stiffeners improve the strength-to-weight ratio of elastica domes significantly showing much improvement in the nonlinear stability behavior including in the postbuckling range.

AB - Structural reliability/redundancy has become a serious concern in the building industry after the poor performance of some buildings in recent earthquakes. Yet, there is a general lack of thorough understanding of structural redundancy under seismic excitations among practitioners and researchers, which could lead to questionable design recommendations concerning reliability/redundancy. In this study, the redundancies of special moment resisting frames and dual systems are investigated. Major factors considered include structural configuration (number of bays of moment–resistant frames and number and layout of shear walls), ductility capacity, uncertainty in demand and capacity, interaction between walls and moment frames, and three-dimensional motions. Responses under uniform-hazard ground motions and reliabilities of conceptual structural models of equal total lateral strength but different configurations and ductility capacities are compared. The reliability/redundancy is found to be dependent only moderately on the structural configuration. The effect of ductility capacity and three-dimensional motions, on the other hand, could produce larger differences. A uniform-risk redundancy factor is then developed for design and compared with the reliability/redundancy factor ρ in current codes. The latter is found to be inconsistent. It generally overestimates the effect of system configuration and underestimates effects of ductility capacity and three-dimensional motions.

AB - The use of hollow structural steel (HSS) columns filled with concrete has become widespread in the past few decades. The residual strength of a composite column may be used to assess the potential damage caused by fire and help to establish an approach to calculate the structural fire protection for minimum postfire repair. The behavior of 12 concrete-filled HSS columns with or without fire protection after exposure to the ISO-834 fire standard subjected to axial or eccentric loads has been experimentally investigated and the results presented in this paper. Comparisons are made with predicted column strengths using the existing codes such as LRFD-AISC-1994, AIJ-1997, EC4-1996, DL5085/T-1999, and GJB4142-2000. A mechanics model is developed in this paper for concrete-filled HSS columns after exposure to the ISO-834 fire standard, and is a development of the analysis used for ambient condition. The predicted load versus mid-span deflection relationship for the composite columns is in good agreement with test results. Based on the theoretical model, influence of the changing strength of the materials, fire duration time, sectional dimensions, steel ratio, load eccentricity ratio and slenderness ratio on the residual strength index (RSI) is discussed. It was found that, in general, the slenderness ratio, sectional dimensions and the fire duration time have a significant influence on the RSI. However, the steel ratio, the load eccentricity ratio and the strength of the materials have a moderate influence on RSI. Finally, formulas suitable for incorporation into building code, for the calculation of the residual strength of the concrete-filled HSS columns after exposure to ISO-834 fire standard are developed based on the parametric analysis results.

AB - A linear programming (LP) formulation is proposed for the evaluation of the plastic limit temperature of flexibly connected steel frames exposed to fire. Within a framework of discrete models and piecewise linearized yield surfaces, the formulation is derived based on the lower-bound theorem in plastic theory, which leads to a compact matrix form of an LP problem. The plastic limit temperature is determined when the equilibrium and yield conditions are satisfied. The plastic mechanism can be checked from the dual solutions in the final simplex tableau of the primal LP solutions. Three examples are presented to investigate the effects of the partial-strength beam-to-column joints. Eigenvalue analysis of the assembled structural stiffness matrix at the predicted limit temperature is performed to check for structural instability. The advantage of the proposed method is that it is simple, computationally efficient, and its solutions provide the necessary information at the limit temperature. The method can be used as an efficient tool to a more refined but computationally expensive step-by-step historical deformation analysis.

AB - Floor slabs of deep basement structures are subjected to large compressive forces due to soil and hydraulic lateral pressures. In this study, nonlinear finite-element analyses were carried out to improve the existing moment magnifier method so that it is applicable to the long-term behavior of the flat plates. For this purpose, a computer program that can address creep and shrinkage as well as geometrical and material nonlinearity was developed. Parametric studies were performed to investigate the characteristics of the long-term behavior and the load-carrying capacities of flat plates. In the proposed moment magnifier method, the creep factor was introduced to accommodate the effect of creep on the load-carrying capacity. A design example was presented to demonstrate the proposed design method.

AB - The present study describes a nonlinear analysis model developed for externally prestressed structures. This model is capable of simulating the slip of the tendon on the deviator and the friction at the interface of the tendon and deviator. Combing the model with concrete and reinforcing steel models, a computer program for material and geometric nonlinear analysis of externally prestressed concrete structures, based on the incremental load method, is developed. The numerical procedure can predict the responses of externally prestressed concrete structures throughout their prestressing transfer and service load history, such as elastic and plastic deformation, cracking, and damage patterns. Two examples are analyzed to verify its capability and efficiency. Analytical and experimental results show good agreement with each other. The comparison of the geometric linear and nonlinear analytical results demonstrates that the second-order effects, associated with the progressive change in eccentricity of the tendons with the increase of member deformation, can be reduced effectively by setting deviators. The second-order effects are negligible when the deviator or deviators are set.

AB - A method of global nondestructive evaluation for identifying local damage and decay in timber beams was developed in previous analytical studies and verified experimentally using simply supported beams in the laboratory. The method employs experimental modal analysis and an algorithm that monitors changes in modal strain energy between the mode shapes of a damaged structure with respect to the undamaged structure. A simple three-girder bridge was built and tested in a laboratory to investigate the capability and limitations of the method for detecting damage in a multimember timber structure. The laboratory tests showed that the method can correctly detect and locate a simulated pocket of decay inflicted at the end of a girder as well as detect a notch removed from the midspan of a girder. The tests showed that the method can correctly detect damage simultaneously at two locations within the bridge, but also that large magnitudes of damage at one location can mask smaller magnitudes of damage at another location. When a calibrated baseline model is used to represent the undamaged state of the bridge, the results show that the method of nondestructive evaluation is able to detect each case of inflicted damage, but with some increase in localization error.

AB - An explicit elastic stability analysis for local buckling of fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) structural shapes is presented. Flange of pultruded FRP wide-flange sections is modeled as a discrete panel with elastic restraint at one unloaded edge and free at the other unloaded edge [restrained-free (RF) condition] and subjected to uniform distributed axial in-plane force along simply supported loaded edges. By considering a linear combination of simply supported-free and clamped-free boundary displacement fields as an interpolation function of the RF buckling, a variational formulation of the Ritz method is used to establish an eigenvalue problem, and a flange critical local buckling coefficient is determined. An explicit solution is obtained for local compressive buckling strength of orthotropic panels with the RF condition and is expressed in term of the coefficient of elastic restraint based on the flexibility of flange-web connection. The explicit predictions are in good agreements with experimental data, exact transcendental solutions, and finite-element analyses for local buckling of FRP wide-flange columns. The formulation developed in this paper is the first attempt in the literature for explicit buckling analysis of orthotropic plates with RF condition and can facilitate the local buckling analysis and design of open FRP structural profiles (e.g., I and channel shapes).

AB - A new approach is presented for the calculation of moments on top slab in single-cell box girders. Using the classic thin plate theory, trigonometric series solutions for bending moments of the top slab under local distributed load and concentrated load with elastically clamped boundary conditions are derived. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the application of the proposed method.
