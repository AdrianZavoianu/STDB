AB - An evaluation as to the appropriateness of using the current American building and bridge specification (according to AASHTO 1998 and AISC 1999) provisions for cross-sectional compactness and adequate bracing is carried out within the context of flexural applications involving A709 Gr. HPS483W high performance steel I-shaped girders. It is observed from the current research that when HPS483W beams are proportioned and braced so as to satisfy the current AISC and AASHTO flange compactness, web compactness, and bracing provisions, less than half of the required flexural ductility is available to accommodate inelastic force redistribution in structural systems. As a result, new flange and web compactness criteria, as well as new bracing criteria, are proposed in the present paper for use in the design of A709 Gr. HPS483W I-shaped beams.

AB - The present study employs experimentally verified nonlinear finite element modeling techniques for the study of hybrid high performance steel I-shaped beams. An evaluation as to the appropriateness of using the current American building and bridge specification (as reported by AASHTO in 1998 and AISC in 1999) provisions for cross-sectional compactness and adequate bracing is carried out within the context of applications involving A709 Gr. HPS483W high performance steel. It is observed from the current research that hybrid high performance steel (HPS) beams proportioned and braced according to current AISC and AASHTO flange compactness, web compactness, and bracing provisions, will exhibit less than half of the required flexural ductility needed to accommodate inelastic force redistribution. As a result of this observation, new flange compactness criteria, as well as new bracing criteria, are proposed in the present paper for use in the design of A709 Gr. HPS483W hybrid beams employing compact webs made from lower strength steels.

AB - C and Z sections are two of the most common cold-formed steel shapes in use today. Accurate prediction of the bending performance of these sections is important for reliable and efficient cold-formed steel structures. Recent analytical work has highlighted discontinuities and inconsistencies in the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) and Canadian Standards Association (S136) design provisions for stiffened elements under a stress gradient (i.e., the web of C or Z sections). New methods have been proposed for design, and an interim method has been adopted in the North American Specification (NAS). However, existing tests on C and Z sections do not provide a definitive evaluation of the design expressions, due primarily to incomplete restriction of the distortional buckling mode. Described in this paper is a series of flexural tests with details selected specifically to insure that local buckling is free to form, but distortional buckling and lateral-torsional buckling are restricted. The members selected for the tests provide systematic variation in the web slenderness (h/t) while varying other relevant nondimensional parameters (i.e., h/b, b/t, d/t, d/b). Initial analysis of the completed testing indicates that overall test-to-predicted ratios for AISI, S136, NAS, and the direct strength method are all adequate, but systematic differences are observed.

AB - The equation for the required area of the intermediate transverse stiffener stipulated in the current AASHTO and AISC specifications was derived under the assumption that the transverse stiffener is subjected to an axial compression resulting from diagonal tension developed in the postbuckling stage as noted by Basler in 1963. However, the area requirement is known to be overly conservative. A recent study by Lee et al. in 2002 reported that the transverse stiffener is not necessarily subjected to an axial compressive force during postbuckling of the web panel and hence the current area requirement can be eliminated. The study also reported that the flexural rigidity should be increased several times higher than that required for elastic shear buckling in order for the web panel to develop its potential ultimate shear strength. In the present study, an experiment was conducted in order to investigate the behavior of the transverse stiffeners during postbuckling. The test results confirmed the earlier findings. A new design rule for the sizing of the transverse stiffeners is formulated through extensive nonlinear finite element analysis data verified by test results.

AB - The behavior of angles in a bolted angle beam-to-column connection is experimentally investigated. The purpose of this investigation is to determine how the angle size and bolt gage length, defined as the distance between the bolt line passing through the column and the heel of the angle, affect the connection stiffness, strength, energy dissipation capacity, and resistance to low-cycle fatigue. The test results show that the angles are capable of considerable strength beyond the point at which a yield mechanism occurs. The associated stiffness, i.e., postyield stiffness, is approximately linear and comprised of both geometric and material hardening. The bolt gage length greatly influences all connection characteristics studied. A larger amount of energy can be dissipated for connections with smaller bolt gage lengths. However, connections with smaller bolt gage lengths generally have a lower fatigue life. An analytical model is presented that predicts the behavior of bolted beam-to-column angle connections. The correlation with test results is good.

AB - This paper describes an experimental study on the seismic performance of concentrically braced steel frames made with cold-formed rectangular tubular bracing members. A total of 24 quasistatic cyclic tests were performed on full size X bracing and single diagonal bracing systems. Two loading sequences were considered: a symmetrical stepwise increasing deformation sequence and a displacement history obtained from nonlinear dynamic analyses of typical braced steel frames. All specimens buckled out-of the plane of the frame and the tests were interrupted when fracture of the braces occurred in the region of highest curvature. For X bracing, the results clearly show that the effective length of the braces can be used to determine their compression strength and to characterize their hysteretic response, including energy dissipation capability. Simplified models are proposed to predict the out-of-plane deformation of the braces as a function of the ductility level. These models are then used to develop an empirical expression to assess the inelastic deformation capacity before fracture of bracing members made of rectangular hollow sections.

AB - An experimental program was undertaken to investigate the inelastic seismic response of metal deck roofing systems. The load carrying capacity of roof diaphragms for low-rise steel buildings, subjected to lateral loads from wind and/or earthquakes, is directly dependent on the performance of the connections. This paper provides information on the cyclic response, including load versus displacement hysteresis and energy absorption capacity of 45 screwed, button punched, and welded side lap connections, for different steel deck types. All of the connections were able to sustain some degree of inelastic response. Typically, welded side lap connections are able to carry the largest shear forces and absorb the greatest amount of energy.

This paper provides information on the inelastic cyclic response, including load versus displacement hysteresis and energy absorption capacity of 144 deck-to-frame screwed, powder-actuated fastener, and welded connection tests for different steel deck and structure thickness. Powder-actuated fastener connections were able to provide the highest energy dissipation results, followed closely by screwed connections. In many cases, the welded connections exhibited significant ultimate capacities, but failed at small displacements, resulting in low energy dissipation values. However, when welds with washers were used, the ductility and energy absorption ability of the connection were substantially improved.

AB - A series of 18 large-scale tests was carried out on corrugated cold-formed steel deck diaphragms for single-story buildings to investigate the diaphragm’s ability to function as the main source for absorbing earthquake induced energy through inelastic behavior. Tests were performed using a cantilever type configuration for the test setup, in which the steel deck was laid in a horizontal plane. Diaphragm assemblies made with 0.76 and 0.91 mm thick metal deck sheets and with nine combinations of deck-to-frame and deck-to-deck (side lap) fasteners were tested. For each fastening combination, two tests were conducted: monotonic and quasistatic cyclic. Both the strength and failure modes under quasistatic cyclic loading are different from those under monotonic loading. Test results indicate that diaphragms with welded deck-to-frame fasteners without washers have limited ductility and cannot sustain cyclic loading at relatively large displacement amplitudes. The use of mechanical and welded-with-washer deck-to-frame fasteners enhances the strength, ductility and energy dissipation characteristics of the diaphragm considerably.

AB - A five-year, large- and small-scale, static and dynamic experimental research program, in which more than 700 tests were conducted, has demonstrated that unreinforced masonry infills are more ductile and resist lateral loads more effectively than anticipated by conventional code procedures. The tests were conducted both in the laboratory and on existing structures at the Department of Energy’s Y-12 National Security Complex. The experimental data indicate that the combination of a steel frame and infill material efficiently resists lateral loads—the infilling provides significant lateral stiffness while the surrounding frame adds ductility and confinement to the overall system. The results from approximately 25 moderate- and full-scale tests on infills showed that with simulated seismic loads the frames confined the masonry, and the load-carrying capacity of the infill was considerably above the load that caused initial cracking. This finding was a significant departure from classical code approaches that assumed first cracking to be failure of an unreinforced masonry wall. The experimental program, performed for the U.S. Department of Energy, consisted of the following large-scale tests on infills: in situ airbag pressure testing, shake-table tests, and the application of quasistatic in-plane and out-of-plane drift loads. In situ and laboratory constitutive property tests were also conducted. This paper provides a summary of the overall experimental methodology and results.

AB - This paper presents and analyzes experimental results of tests of 15 four-column frame specimens subjected to progressively increasing unidirectional ground shaking to collapse. The specimens were subdivided into groups of three different column slenderness ratios: 100, 150, and 200. Within each group, the column dimensions and supported mass varied. Ground motion of varying magnitudes was required to collapse the structure tested. The experimental setup is briefly described and results are presented. Test structure performance is compared with proposed limits for minimizing P-Δ effects in highway bridge piers. The stability factor is found to have a strong relation to the relative structural performance in this regard. Performance is also compared with capacity predicted by currently used strength and stability axial-moment interaction design equations by expressing these capacities in terms of acceleration and maximum base shear (as a fraction of the system’s weight). The experimental results exceeded the maximum spectral accelerations calculated when considering second-order effects, but did not when considering only member strength. Finally, an example of how to use the experimental data for analytical model verification is presented, illustrating the shortcomings/inaccuracies of using a particular simplified model with constant structural damping.

AB - A model is developed to represent the response of reinforced-concrete beam-column joints under reversed-cyclic loading. The proposed model provides a simple representation of the primary inelastic mechanisms that determine joint behavior: Failure of the joint core under shear loading and anchorage failure of beam and column longitudinal reinforcement embedded in the joint. The model is implemented as a four-node 12-degree-of-freedom element that is appropriate for use with typical hysteretic beam-column line elements in two-dimensional nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures. Constitutive relationships are developed to define the load-deformation response of the joint model on the basis of material, geometric, and design parameters. Comparison of simulated and observed response for a series of joint subassemblages with different design details indicates that the proposed model is appropriate for use in simulating response under earthquake loading.

AB - In the past two decades, the development of algorithms for structural engineering applications has received a boost due to the advent of parallel computers. Considerable research is being done in order to rewrite algorithms originally designed to run on sequential machines as well as to develop new methods that take advantage of the parallelism offered by the multiprocessing computers. This work is concerned with some of the parallel algorithms that have been developed in this field. More specifically, it is a survey of parallel algorithms that are of interest to structural engineering. Such algorithms include parallel solvers (direct and iterative) for linear systems of algebraic equations, techniques for the parallelization of the finite element method, and concurrent time-stepping algorithms for the solution of the equations of evolution arising in structural dynamic problems. One should keep in mind that parallel processing is a rapidly evolving field and it is the focus of intensive research worldwide. Extensive research on new methodologies for the development of concurrent algorithm is underway in universities and industry.

Since the need to avoid long compressive spans can be critical in determining the optimal form of such structures, a formulation is used wherein the structure is modeled as a linear elastic continuum subjected to design loads, and optimized in form to maximize the minimum critical buckling load. Numerical issues pertinent to accurate solution of the linearized buckling eigenvalue problem and accurate design sensitivity analysis are discussed. The performance of the proposed design formulation is demonstrated on a few problems designed to find optimal forms of a canyon bridge, long-span bridges, and an electrical transmission tower. In all cases, very credible structural forms are obtained with the proposed design formulation. The results of the design examples solved are typically superior structural forms with regard to buckling stability than those obtained to minimize the mean structural compliance.

AB - The properties of steel at elevated temperatures are very important to the analysis of steel structures subjected to fire. This note reports on the results of the experimental studies on the high-temperature properties of two kinds of constructional steel widely used in China. One is 16Mn steel which is used in steel frameworks and the other one is 20MnTiB steel which is used for high-strength bolts. The data obtained from the experiments include yield strength, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, elongation, and thermal expansion coefficient. Based on the data, the formulas for predicting the properties of the steels at elevated temperatures have been established. It is found from our studies that different types of steel may have different high-temperature properties. So for steel construction in the fire-resistant design purpose, it is more reliable to employ the specified high-temperature-property model based on the specified research.

AB - Lateral strengths required to avoid dynamic instability of single-degree-of-freedom systems are examined. Oscillators with a bilinear hysteretic behavior with negative postyield stiffness are considered. Mean lateral strengths normalized by the lateral strength required to maintain the system elastic are computed for systems with periods ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 s when subjected to 72 earthquake ground motions recorded on firm soil. The effect of the period of vibration and postyield stiffness are investigated. Results indicate that mean normalized lateral strengths required to avoid dynamic instability decrease as negative postyield stiffness increases and that the reductions are much larger for small negative postyield stiffness than for severe negative postyield stiffnesses. It is concluded that there is a significant influence of the period of vibration for short-period systems and for systems with mildly negative postyield stiffnesses. Dispersion of normalized lateral strengths required to avoid dynamic instability are found to increase as the negative postyield stiffness decreases and as the period of vibration increases. Simple equations that capture the effects of period and postyield stiffness to aid in the evaluation of existing structures are obtained through nonliner regression analyses.
