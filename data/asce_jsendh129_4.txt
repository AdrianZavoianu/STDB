AB - The ASCE 7 peak-gust map divides the United States into two main adjacent wind speed zones that do not reflect correctly the country’s differentiated extreme wind climate. Following a request by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), CPP Inc. through Texas Tech Univ. provided information used for the development of the map and for its a posteriori justification. Using this information we show that the methodology used in the map’s development averages out real climatological differences and causes severe bias errors for the following reasons: (1) the estimation of the speeds was based on superstations, of which 80% included stations that were also contained in one or more other superstations; (2) stations with significantly different physical geography and meteorology were in many cases included in the same superstation; (3) legitimate wind speed data were omitted from data records in cases in which analyses resulted in speeds different from those postulated in the map; (4) and off-the-shelf smoothing software was used that does not account for physical geography and meteorological differences. Case studies show that the map entails severe bias errors, causing unnecessary waste due to overestimated wind loads or potential losses due to underestimated wind loads.

AB - Polymer matrix composite (PMC)-infill walls hold great promise for energy dissipation when used in retrofitting applications where seismic activity is a consideration. This paper presents the analysis, design, and testing of PMC-infill walls developed for seismic retrofitting applications. The PMC-infill wall system consists of two fiber-reinforced polymer laminates with an infill of vinyl sheet foam. At the interface between the laminates, viscoelastic honeycomb is used to dissipate energy and improve the damping characteristics of the structure. As part of this research, analytical and experimental studies were performed to explore the effectiveness of this seismic retrofitting strategy and to examine the behavior of the PMC-infill wall system when subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. A steel frame retrofitted with a PMC-infill wall was monitored to assess the resultant enhancements to its seismic-energy resistance capacity. In testing the PMC-infill wall system in this research, a large-scale steel frame was used to avoid the typical uncertainties associated with scaling the dimensions. The optimal design for the stacking sequence of a PMC-infill wall panel was determined based on the performance and material cost using the finite-element analysis. Finally, the observed behavior of the PMC-infilled frame was assessed on the bases of stiffness, strength, modes of failure, and energy dissipation output. The experimental and analytical studies demonstrate that the introduction of a PMC-infill wall panel in a semirigidly connected steel frame produces significant enhancements to stiffness, strength, and energy dissipation.

AB - Advanced fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites, which have been favored for certain aerospace, military, marine, and automotive applications, now are starting to be introduced in buildings, bridges, and other civil construction, where their desirable properties can enhance performance. A load and resistance factor design (LRFD) standard for composites would facilitate their use in civil infrastructure, creating a market for new FRP building materials by providing a basis for structural design that is comparable with existing LRFD standards for other common construction materials. Such a specification must take into account the distinguishing features of FRP composites: Their orthotropic nature, sensitivity to moisture, temperature, and ultraviolet effects, dependence of strength and stiffness on the rate of application and duration of structural loads, and uncertainties in their mechanical and structural properties. The structural reliability tools needed to develop an LRFD standard are at hand. However, at present, only rudimentary statistical databases required to support this development are available. If such databases were to become available in the near future, practical LRFD design criteria could be implemented for civil construction.

AB - Investigated is the basic premise that the roof displacement of a multistory building can be determined from the deformation of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDF) system. The responses of both systems are determined rigorously by nonlinear response history analysis, without introducing any of the approximations underlying the simplified methods for estimating the deformation of a SDF system (see, e.g., FEMA-273 or ATC-40 guidelines). The statistics of the SDF system estimate of roof displacement are presented for a variety of generic frames and six SAC buildings subjected to ground motion ensembles. Data obtained for generic frames indicate that the first “mode” SDF system overestimates the median roof displacement for systems subjected to large ductility demand μ, but underestimates for small μ. The bias and dispersion tend to increase for longer period system for every value of μ. Similar data for SAC buildings demonstrate that the bias and dispersion on the SDF estimate of roof displacement increases when P-delta effects (due to gravity loads) are included. The modal pushover analysis procedure has the advantage of reducing the dispersion in the roof displacement and the underestimation of the median roof displacement for elastic or nearly elastic cases at the expense of increasing slightly the overestimate of roof displacement of buildings responding far into the inelastic range.

AB - Full-scale data on damping of buildings in Japan have been collected by the Damping Evaluation Committee of the Architectural Institute of Japan. Reliable data on 137 steel-framed buildings, 25 reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, 43 steel-framed reinforced concrete (SRC) buildings have been compiled in a database. Most of these data have been evaluated from vibration tests in a small amplitude region. This paper describes damping ratio characteristics of steel-framed buildings and RC/SRC buildings based on analyses of the database, including effects of several building factors. It is shown that the higher the building, the smaller the first-mode damping ratio. Furthermore, the damping ratios seem to be affected by building use: Those of hotels and apartments are generally larger than those of other buildings. However, damping ratios are more widely scattered than natural periods, because they are also affected by vibration amplitude, foundation type, and so on. Frequency and amplitude dependencies of damping ratios are also examined, and predictors of damping ratios with their dependencies are proposed.

AB - A longitudinal branch plate-to-rectangular hollow structural section (HSS) member connection tends to cause excessive distortion of the HSS connecting face. Such a connection therefore results in a relatively low, deformation limit state, design resistance. A “through” branch plate connection that extends through both walls of the rectangular HSS member can be used to increase the design resistance of a standard longitudinal branch plate connection. The results of an experimental test program and a corresponding numerical study, using the finite-element method on longitudinal and corresponding through branch plate-to-HSS connections are presented in this paper. The strength and behavior of longitudinal versus through branch plate-to-HSS connections is henceforth determined and a unified limit states design (LRFD) procedure for these cognate connections is proposed.

AB - Joints in steel rectangular hollow sections filled with concrete present the added difficulty of involving the deformability of the connected faces in bending. This implies that, unless a good estimate of the moment-rotation curve can be obtained, complex and expensive detailing is required to ensure a fairly rigid response of the joint. A first step to achieve the objective of predicting the behavior of such a joint corresponds to an assessment of the initial stiffness of the joint. Starting with a brief review of the current state-of-the-art in the behavior of joints in hollow sections, this paper presents and discusses an analytical model based on an equivalent strip of the loaded face. A simple solution based on this model that has been calibrated with numerical simulations is also derived. The main parameters considered are the thickness of the loaded face and the dimensions of the loading area. Comparisons with some available numerical and experimental results are quite encouraging.

AB - The present study investigated the effects of shear slip on the deformation of steel–concrete composite beams. The equivalent rigidity of composite beams considering three different loading types was first derived based on equilibrium and curvature compatibility, from which a general formula to account for slip effects was then developed. The predicted results were compared with measurements of six specimens tested in the present study and other available test results for both simply supported and continuous beams. It was found that including slip effects has significantly improved the accuracy of prediction. For typical beams used in practice, shear slip in partial composite beams has a significant contribution to beam deformation. Even for full composite beams, slip effects may result in stiffness reduction up to 17% for short span beams. However, slip effects are ignored in many design specifications that use transformed section method except that American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) specifications recommend a calculation procedure in the commentary. In the AISC procedure, stress and deflection calculations of partially composite girders are based on effective section modulus and moment of inertia to account for slip, while ignoring slip effects in full composite sections. For full composite sections, the effective section modulus and moment of inertia calculated with the AISC specifications are larger than that of present study, meaning that the specifications are not on the conservative side. For partial composite sections, the AISC predictions are more conservative than the present study.

AB - This paper describes a series of tests to failure of fix-ended tubular braces subjected to cyclic concentric axial loading. The braces were made from cold-formed steel grade C350L0 (350 MPa nominal yield stress) circular hollow sections (CHS). Nine different diameter-to-thickness ratios in the range of 19&lt;D/t&lt;56 that have a moderate member slenderness in the range of 25&lt;KL/r&lt;41 were tested. The effects of three loading protocols on the inelastic hysteresis behavior of the CHS braces were examined. The CHS braces exhibited stable hysteresis behavior up to local buckling, and then showed considerable degradation in strength and ductility depending on KL/r and D/t ratios. First-cycle buckling loads were compared with design loads predicted using a number of steel specifications. The effects of section and member slenderness on strength, ductility, and energy absorption capacity of the braces were examined. The structure response factor (ductility index) was determined and used to derive new section slenderness limits suitable for seismic design.

AB - A tensegrity is a lightweight space structure consisting of compression members surrounded by a network of tension members. They can be easily dismantled and therefore provide innovative possibilities for reusable and modular structures. Tensegrities can adapt their shape by changing their self stress, and when equipped with sensors and actuators, they can adapt to changing environments. A full-scale prototype of an adjustable tensegrity has been built and tested at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL). This paper begins with a description of important aspects of the design, assembly, and static testing. Tests show that the structure behaves linearly when subjected to vertical loads applied to a single joint. Nonlinearities are detected for small displacements, for loads applied to several joints and for adjusting combinations of telescoping compression members. To predict behavior, dynamic relaxation—a nonlinear method—has been found to be reliable. Appropriate strut adjustments found by a stochastic search algorithm are identified for the control goal of constant roof slope and for the load conditions studied. When adjusting struts, an excessive number of adjustable members does not necessarily lead to improved performance.

AB - The strengthening of existing concrete structures is a major concern in recent years as the number of degraded structures increases. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the static and fatigue behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened with steel plates. Toward this end, a comprehensive test program has been set up and many series of strengthened beams have been tested. The major test variables include the plate thickness, adhesive thickness, and the shear-span-to-depth ratio. The test results indicate that the separation of plates is the dominant failure mechanism even for the full-span-length strengthened beams with steel plates. The actual measured load capacities for strengthened beams are found to be smaller than the theoretical ultimate load capacities which are based on the full composite action of a concrete beam and steel plate. The strengthened beams exhibit more dominant shear cracking as the shear-span-to-depth ratio decreases. The ultimate capacity of strengthened beams increases slightly with the increase of adhesive thickness, which may be caused by the late initiation of plate separation in the beams with thicker adhesive. The present study also indicates that the strengthened beams exhibit much higher fatigue resistance than the unstrengthened beams at the same fatigue load level. The increase of deflections of strengthened beams according to the number of load cycles is much smaller than that of unstrengthened beams. The present study provides very useful results for the realistic application of the plate-strengthening method in RC structures.

AB - The most widely used procedure available in literature for determining creep and shrinkage effects in RC building frames, designated herein as approximate procedure (AP), has been recommended for buildings having flexible slab systems (low beam stiffness) and with a number of stories not exceeding 30. Recently an accurate procedure termed as consistent procedure (CP) has been developed which is applicable for low as well as for high beam stiffness and requires no restriction on the number of stories. In this paper, using CP, behavioral studies are reported for frames with high beam stiffness. For a 60 story frame, studies are reported for steel ratio, volume to surface ratio, and number of stories. It is shown that the effect of inelastic deflections on final elastic forces is complex and strongly depends upon percentage of reinforcement and volume to surface ratio. When the effect of these two parameters mutually reinforce each other, the load transfer among columns can be significant. On the other hand when these effects balance each other, the load transfer is low.

AB - This paper describes a theory, according to which the shear failure of reinforced concrete deep beams under two-point or a single-point loading, with a shear span to effective depth ratio (a/d) between 1.0 and 2.5, is due to a crushing of concrete in a compression zone with a restricted depth above the tip of the critical diagonal crack. Simple expressions are derived for the restricted depth of the compression zone, as well as for the ultimate shear force of deep beams with and without web reinforcement. The derived formulas from this analysis are verified by comparisons to extensive sets of experimental data from literature, which have been obtained on deep beams with various strengths of concrete, main steel ratios, shear reinforcement ratios, and shear span to depth (a/d) ratios between 1.0 and 2.5.

AB - The application of artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the confined compressive strength and corresponding strain of circular concrete columns is explored. Using available data from past experiments, an ANN model with input parameters consisting of the unconfined compressive strength, core diameter, column height, yield strength of lateral reinforcement, volumetric ratio of lateral reinforcement, tie spacing, and longitudinal steel ratio was found to be acceptable in predicting the confined compressive strength and corresponding strain of circular concrete columns subject to limitations in the training data. The study shows the importance of validating the ANN models in simulating physical processes especially when data are limited. The ANN model was also compared to some analytical models and was found to perform well.
