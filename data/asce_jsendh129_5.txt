AB - Old residential buildings, such as those built before 1960, were commonly supported on cripple walls, which are walls constructed of short wooden studs between the foundation and first floor framing. For most of these old buildings, the inertial force developed by the horizontal earthquake ground motion must be resisted entirely by the cripple wall and wall-to-foundation connection. Past earthquakes in California have shown that unbraced cripple walls are particularly vulnerable due to insufficient lateral resistance, even for a moderate level of ground shaking. This paper summarizes the results of a test program conducted on level and stepped cripple walls. Specimens with details representative of current construction and retrofit were tested using displacement histories recommended for ordinary and near-fault ground motions. Key parameters of the test program included the height and slope of the cripple wall, gravity load level, stucco finish, loading history, and framing details for stepped cripple walls. Results from the test program are compared with current design values.

AB - Relations for the equivalent period Teq and equivalent damping ratio ζeq for the equivalent linear system approach for seismic design are proposed. These relations are based on optimal Teq and ζeq values derived from extensive time-history analyses of single-degree-of-freedom systems with six types of hysteretic behavior and a period range of 0.1 to 1.5 s. The proposed relations are more general (in their applicability to a wide range of hysteretic systems) and have stronger ties to physical behavior compared to existing empirical methods for evaluating Teq and ζeq. The proposed relations address differences in equivalent stiffness resulting from different hysteretic behavior. Simulations show that the optimal Teq, associated with the stiffness of the partial load-displacement cycles of a hysteretic system, is the highest for the slip system (with a zero unloading/reloading stiffness) and the lowest for the bilinear elastic system (with an elastic unloading/reloading stiffness). The optimal ζeq, associated with the energy dissipation capacity of a hysteretic system, is the highest for the elastoplastic system and the lowest for the bilinear elastic system.

AB - A new type of earthquake-resisting element, consisting of a steel plate shear wall with vertical slits, is introduced. In this system, the steel plate segments between the slits behave as a series of flexural links, which provide a fairly ductile response without the need for heavy stiffening of the wall. Test results are presented for 42 wall plate specimens of roughly one-third of full scale, which were subjected to static monotonic and cyclic lateral loading. These tests provide data on general behavior of the walls, which provides the basis for models to calculate the wall strength and stiffness and design the out-of-plane stiffening. When properly detailed and fabricated to avoid premature failure due to tearing or out-of-plane buckling, the wall panels respond in a ductile manner, with a concentration of inelastic action at the top and bottom of the flexural links. The test data indicate that limiting the width-to-thickness ratio to less than 20 in the flexural links will ensure that the walls can sustain roughly 3% drift without substantial hysteretic degradation.

AB - The seismic performance of concrete-backed stone masonry walls subject to cyclic load is experimentally evaluated. Six 1/3-scale, single-story, single-bay wall samples were tested. Three of these samples were constructed using an old construction method and the other three were constructed using a new construction method. The influence of the type of construction, applied vertical loads, and existence of dowels between the infill concrete panel and the base on the lateral resistance, ductility, energy-dissipation, stiffness degradation, and failure mechanisms were investigated. The experimental results indicate that an increase in the applied vertical load resulted in a substantial increase in both the lateral strength and stiffness of the tested samples. The type of construction had no influence on the ultimate lateral load resistance. The existence of the dowels caused the diagonal cracks to be shifted upward far from the base. Also, the dowels gave a better distribution and smaller widths for these diagonal cracks. The failure mechanisms of all concrete-backed stone masonry walls were dominated by diagonal shear cracks.

AB - A series of four shear wall specimens was tested in order to evaluate the seismic retrofit that had been proposed for the core wall of an existing building. The core wall had nonductile reinforcing details, including lap splices in the longitudinal reinforcement in potential plastic hinging regions, inadequate confinement of boundary regions, and inadequate anchorage of the transverse reinforcement. The seismic retrofit involved the use of headed reinforcement, carbon fiber wrap, and reinforced concrete collars at the base of the wall. The four shear wall specimens were tested under reversed cyclic loading. Two of these walls had a lap splice in the longitudinal steel at the base of the wall, and the other two had a lap splice 600 mm from the base of the wall. One of each of these specimens was tested in the as-built condition and the other two were retrofit prior to testing. The test results show that the retrofit strategies were successful in improving the ductility and energy dissipation of the shear walls.

AB - A recent innovation in shear strengthening of reinforced concrete beams is to externally bond fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Many studies have been undertaken on this strengthening technique. These studies have established clearly that such strengthened beams fail in shear mainly in one of the two modes: FRP rupture and FRP debonding, and have led to preliminary design proposals. This paper is concerned with the development of a simple, accurate, and rational design proposal for the shear capacity of FRP-strengthened beams which fail by FRP rupture. To this end, existing design proposals are reviewed, and their efficiencies highlighted. A new strength model is then developed, which recognizes the fundamental characteristics of FRP. The model is validated against experimental data collected from the existing literature. Finally, a new design proposal is presented.

AB - Concrete filled steel columns have seen an increased usage in building structures throughout the world. In Australia, the use of thin-walled steel sections coupled with concrete infill has been used on various building projects with great advantage. The major advantages of the use of thin-walled steel sections are the reduced structural steel costs and the economy in construction that the method provides. This paper presents both an experimental and theoretical treatment of coupled local and global buckling of concrete filled steel columns sometimes termed interaction buckling. The paper then concludes with comparisons of design recommendations for the strength evaluation of slender composite columns with thin-walled steel sections.

AB - In this paper, a simple method of analysis for preliminary analysis of facade rigger stiffened braced frames in tall buildings subjected to horizontal loading is presented. The facade riggers in the structure are located in the exterior frames in the direction of the lateral loading. The interaction between the braced frames and facade riggers is through the floor diaphragms adjacent to the chords of the riggers. The method of analysis requires the calculation of five stiffness parameters: bending and racking shear stiffnesses of the braced frames and facade riggers in addition to a bending stiffness of the exterior frames in which the riggers are located. The method allows a graphical procedure for obtaining the optimum level of the facade riggers in addition to a rapid assessment of the influence of the facade riggers on the performance of the high-rise structure such as the reduction in lateral deflection at the top and the overturning moment at the base of the braced frame.

AB - An automated design algorithm for partially restrained and fully restrained steel frames is presented. Advanced analysis based design is utilized and inelastic modeling of member behavior is based upon the distributed plasticity (plastic zone) model. Nonlinear connection behavior is simulated with trilinear moment-rotation curves. The automated design process is implemented using an evolutionary algorithm (EA). Object-oriented (OO) data structures are used to represent building frame components and implement the reproductive operations in the evolutionary algorithm. An optimized design problem is developed using an objective function which includes frame member weight and connection cost/complexity. Constraints related to both service and strength load levels are included. Two frame designs with varying topology are presented and discussions of the OO-EA performance are provided. It is shown that the OO-EA is a robust procedure for the automated design of steel frames using advanced analysis, which suggest that the EA can be a useful methodology upon which to pursue the development of automated performance-based design algorithms.

AB - An elastoplastic analysis of semirigid steel frames subjected to elevated temperature is presented. Within the discretized structural framework, an updated Lagrangian approach is used to incorporate the nonlinear geometric effects on the equilibrium and constitutive conditions. Modeling of elastoplastic behavior is based on the generalized plastic hinge concept for beam-column elements that obey piecewise linearized yield criteria. Under the proportional temperature variation, the analysis for finite temperature increment becomes the standard form of a nonlinear complementarity problem in mathematical programming (MP) formalism. An iterative predictor–corrector scheme coupled with an MP-based method is used in the analytical procedures. Numerical studies are carried out on rigid and semirigid frames. It is found that the benefits of using a full-strength rigid connection over the semirigid one are not unlimited, particularly on the frames with fire-unprotected columns.

AB - Structural analyses of tensegrity structures must account for geometrical nonlinearity. The dynamic relaxation method correctly models static behavior in most situations. However, the requirements for precision increase when these structures are actively controlled. This paper describes the use of neural networks to improve the accuracy of the dynamic relaxation method in order to correspond more closely to data measured from a full-scale laboratory structure. An additional investigation evaluates training the network during the service life for further increases in accuracy. Tests showed that artificial neural networks increased model accuracy when used with the dynamic relaxation method. Replacing the dynamic relaxation method completely by a neural network did not provide satisfactory results. First tests involving training the neural network online showed potential to adapt the model to changes during the service life of the structure.

AB - In a world where financial resources do not keep pace with the growing demand for maintenance of deteriorating structures, it is imperative that those responsible for maintenance decisions make the best possible use of limited financial resources. Decision makers have to evaluate the expected life-cycle maintenance cost of deteriorating structures and use benefit/cost techniques for finding the optimal resource allocation. This paper proposes a methodology for the evaluation of expected life-cycle maintenance cost of deteriorating structures by considering uncertainties associated with the application of cyclic maintenance actions. The methodology can be used to determine the expected number of maintenance interventions on a deteriorating structure, or a group of deteriorating structures, during a specified time horizon and the associated expected maintenance costs. The method is suitable for application to both new and existing civil infrastructures under various maintenance strategies. The ultimate objective is to evaluate the costs of alternative maintenance strategies and determine the optimum maintenance regime over a specified time horizon. In its present format, the first line of application of the method is for highway bridges. However, the method can be used for any structure, or group of structures, requiring maintenance in the foreseeable future. The proposed method can be programmed and incorporated into an existing software package for life-cycle costing of civil infrastructures. An existing reinforced concrete bridge stock is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methodology and to reveal the cost-effectiveness of preventive maintenance interventions.

AB - The widely used concrete tensile strength test, the Brazilian cylinder splitting test, is analyzed using isoparametric nonlinear finite strip elements. The results of the numerical analysis suggest that the apparent tensile strength obtained from the splitting test underestimates the uniaxial tensile strength of concrete. After investigating the effects of various concrete properties and the packing strip width in the splitting test, a simple method for correcting this underestimation is established.
