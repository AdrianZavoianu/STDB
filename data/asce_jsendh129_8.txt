AB - A test program on cold-formed steel channels subjected to concentrated bearing load is presented in this paper. The web slenderness values of the channel specimens ranged from comparatively stocky webs of 15.3 to relatively more slender webs of 62.7. The tests were performed under end and interior loading conditions. The test setup was different from the one specified in the North American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures where the loading support is assumed free to rotate in the plane of the beam. The test specimens were seated on a fixed flat solid steel base plate, and a concentrated load was applied through a bearing plate to the top flange of the channels. The test setup simulates a floor joist member subjected to concentrated load. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the North American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard. It is concluded that the design strengths predicted by the North American Specification are generally conservative for end-two-flange and interior-two-flange loadings, and these design rules are shown to be reliable using reliability analysis. However, the design strengths predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard, that is similar to the American Iron and Steel Institute Specification, are generally unconservative.

AB - This paper is an investigation into retrofitting rectangular hollow sectioned (RHS) struts, the axis of which was damaged during loading. Retrofitting is achieved by welding stiffening plates onto the webs of damaged struts along a portion of their spans. A model for the analysis of pinned crooked retrofitted RHS struts in compression considering geometric nonlinearity and partial yielding about the midspan is described and compared with test results showing good agreement. The model is applied to the design of stiffeners for damaged struts in order to recover their compressive strengths. Stiffener sizes are evaluated for different strut axis crookedness. It is shown that a maximum efficient second-moment of area of the stiffening plates exists independently of the aspect ratios of the RHS cross sections and of the stiffening plates. A relationship between the length of the stiffener and the magnitude of allowable midspan crookedness of the damaged strut is determined. The effects of retrofitting on the secant stiffness of the strut and their postultimate behavior are discussed.

AB - Buildings sited outside the seismic zones such as those in Singapore are not designed for seismic loads. However, the buildings in these regions vibrate due to tremors caused by faults in Sumatra, Indonesia. Therefore, in order to assess the vulnerability of these buildings under low-seismic excitation, it is important to determine the overstrength and ductility of these buildings designed for gravity loads and wind loads or notional horizontal load. In this study, steel frames of three-, six- and ten-story three-bay moment resisting frames (MRFs), concentrically braced frames (CBFs), and semirigid frames are designed according to BS 5950, which does not have any seismic provisions. A nonlinear push-over analysis involving P-Δ effect has been performed on these steel frames, considering the effects of various combination of dead load (DL) and imposed load (IL), viz 1.0DL+0.4IL (most common state), 1.0DL+1.0IL (serviceability state), and 1.2DL+1.2IL (ultimate state). By using the N2 method, the seismic performance of the steel frames are investigated when they are subjected to the “design earthquake” for Singapore. The results show that MRF, CBF, and semirigid steel frame would be subjected to a base shear up to 4.2% of seismic gravity load, while the corresponding value for infilled frames is up to 7.8%. These values are much less than the strength capacity of the steel frames with considerable response modification factors which are the combination of the overstrength and ductility.

AB - The analysis of a degrading dynamic system is presented, and the damage-dependent response characteristics of the model structure are explored. Results from this study show that seismically induced P-Δ effects can significantly affect structural response, even for small amplitudes of axial load. Additionally, this study demonstrates that the rate of damage accumulation, and not necessarily the magnitude of damage, has the greatest impact on the deformation of the model structure. Moreover, research findings indicate that reliance on displacement ductility or drift as the only measure of performance may not be reliable when damage-dependent response is considered.

AB - Unreinforced masonry (URM) walls strengthened with composites were tested to failure at a decommissioned building in St. Louis, Missouri. The walls were subjected to out-of-plane loading. Previous work on URM as well as reinforced masonry walls strengthened with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates has shown remarkable increases in capacity and ductility. However, most of this research work has been conducted in the laboratory, where, it is difficult to reproduce real field conditions. In this context, this experimental program offered a unique opportunity for performing field experimentation on URM walls strengthened FRP laminates showing that shear compression led to controlling the failure of either the upper or lower boundary masonry units. An analytical model that provides good agreement with the experimental results is also presented. The model computes the applied concentrated out-of-plane load, midheight deflection, and rotations at the supports. The analytical model can be easily modified to take into account distributed loads acting on the wall.

AB - Lateral prestressing of concrete columns was investigated as a method of seismic retrofit. Experimental research was conducted to develop a design procedure for shear deficient concrete columns. The technology consists of external prestressing of columns in transverse direction by means of individual hoops that consist of prestressing strands and specially designed anchors. Seven full-scale columns were tested under constant axial compression and incrementally increasing lateral deformation reversals. The results, presented and discussed in this paper, indicate that the retrofit methodology can suppress shear failure, promote flexural behavior, and increase inelastic column deformability substantially. A design procedure is presented for seismic retrofit of shear-deficient columns to achieve two different levels of performance.

AB - In a companion paper, a new finite element technique for the analysis of brickwork infilled plane frames under lateral loads has been presented. In the present paper, the influence of the masonry infill panel opening in the reduction of the infilled frames stiffness has been investigated by means of this technique. A parametric study has been carried out using as parameters the position and the percentage of the masonry infill panel opening for the case of one-story one-bay infilled frame. The investigation has been extended to the case of multistory, fully or partially infilled frames. In particular, the redistribution of action effects of infilled frames under lateral loads has been studied. It is shown that the redistribution of shear force is critically influenced by the presence and continuity of infill panels. The presence of infills leads, in general, to decreased shear forces on the frame columns. However, in the case of an infilled frame with a soft ground story, the shear forces acting on columns are considerably higher than those obtained from the analysis of the bare frame.

AB - An important information required in the determination of models for the concentrated load performance assessment of wood joist floor sheathings is the minimum width of sheathing (effective width) that can be considered to support the load. In this paper, a theoretical study of the effective width in bending of simply supported, fixed, and continuous one-way models of isotropic wood joist floor sheathings is reported. The effective width has been found to be directly proportional to the span, inversely proportional to the thickness and degree of fixity at the supports, and almost independent of the wood sheathing’s mechanical properties. An equation has been developed for calculating the effective width of the models. For the critical simply supported model, the upper and lower bounds of the effective width are 2.0 and 1.4 times the span, respectively. Based on the effective width, a criterion for determining when a fully supported isotropic sheathing reduces to a one- or two-way plate model and geometric models for the concentrated load performance assessment of isotropic wood floor sheathings are proposed.

AB - The derivation of funicular shapes for submerged arches has been the subject of a number of studies. In a recent paper, the solution governing the shape of the arch was derived in a coordinate system involving the arc length s and tangent angle θ of the arch. The solution in s-θ coordinates, however, is not convenient for defining the actual shape of the funicular arch. In this paper, the solution for submerged funicular arches is extended to Cartesian coordinates since the resulting geometric expressions can be more readily used in engineering construction. It will be shown that the submerged funicular arch in Cartesian coordinates involves a combination of elliptic integrals of the first and second kind. An important finding that results from the present formulation is the existence of a minimum compressive force, below which the shape of the funicular arch cannot be determined. Other parameters that are of interest in design are also discussed. The proposed solution for the submerged funicular arch is applied to a design example to illustrate the procedure and effectiveness of the approach.

AB - A nonlinear layered finite element procedure for predicting the structural response of reinforced concrete slabs subjected to fire is described. The proposed procedure is based on Mindlin/Reissner (thick plate) theory, and both geometric and material nonlinearities are taken into account. The complications of structural behavior in fire conditions, such as thermal expansion, cracking or crushing, and change of material properties with temperature are modeled. In this study a total Lagrangian approach is adopted throughout, in which displacements are referred to the original configuration and small strains are assumed. A numerical example, in which a rectangular reinforced concrete slab is modeled at elevated temperatures, is presented. The influences of different thermal expansion characteristics, tensile membrane action, and differential temperature distributions across the thickness of the slab are investigated. It is evident that the nonlinear layered procedure proposed in this paper can properly model the membrane action of concrete slabs in fire conditions. More extensive comparisons with experimental results obtained by previous researchers, both at ambient temperature and in fire conditions, are presented in the companion paper.

AB - A companion paper has documented a geometrically nonlinear layered procedure for modeling of the membrane actions in concrete slabs subject to very high deflections and in fire. The model is based on a layered procedure developed previously by the writers in which only material nonlinearities were taken into account. In this paper two solid reinforced concrete slabs with simply supported edges, tested by other writers at ambient temperature under uniform loading, are modeled. This is followed by a simulation of a full-scale fire test on a solid reinforced concrete slab floor. Finally very detailed simulations of two full-scale fire tests on the composite frame at the Cardington Laboratory are conducted. It is evident that the proposed model can predict structural behavior of reinforced concrete slabs and their influence on composite steel-framed buildings in fire with good accuracy, although the multiplicity of parameters which can affect a test result cannot always be controlled or measured. In all cases the development of membrane actions is demonstrated, and the structural behavior differs compared with the geometrically linear case. These studies provide evidence that while exposed steel temperatures in composite buildings remain below 400°C, the much cooler concrete slab plays little part in the load-carrying mechanism, other than in generating thermal curvature of composite beams. For steel temperatures higher than about 500°C the significance of the slab progressively increases, and it becomes very important to model concrete slabs correctly. At very high temperatures the floor slab becomes the main load-bearing element, and the floor loads above the fire compartment are carried largely by tensile membrane forces developed mainly in the steel anticracking mesh or reinforcing bars.

AB - This paper presents nonlinear modeling and analysis of a decommissioned steel truss bridge (STB) in Franklin County, Ohio that was tested to failure in 1992 and demolished in 1993. When the existing heavy class STB constructed with built-up sections and rigid joints are idealized in the analysis as simple nonredundant trusses, the load rating of the trusses may indicate posting or replacement. The inherent capabilities and the redundancy of heavy class trusses may be studied by nonlinear analysis. In this paper, nonlinear models of the subject bridge are evaluated by sensitivity analysis, the most viable representation of the bridge is selected, and the simulated behavior is correlated with those measured during the destructive testing of the bridge. Analyses suggested that trusses of this bridge possess significant rotational energy that must be dissipated by plastic deformations within the truss joints before the rigid frame-like truss is transformed into a determinate system. Analysis and tests indicated that heavy-class STBs remain redundant and maintain their load capacity even after initiation of material yielding in several members of the main trusses. The paper also discusses the minimum requirements of nonlinear finite element analysis for the strength and failure mode evaluation of existing steel bridges.

AB - Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite jackets are increasingly used for strengthening and retrofit of reinforced concrete columns. The jackets provide lateral confinement to concrete that enhances strength and ductility of the columns. There are a number of existing empirical models that predict an increase in compressive strength and the maximum axial strain of FRP-confined concrete. Comparison with available experimental data indicates a large degree of uncertainty associated with these models. In the paper this uncertainty is estimated and then taken into account in a reliability analysis of FRP-confined columns. Only short columns with circular cross sections under static loads are considered. Based on results of the reliability analysis tentative recommendations are presented on how to modify the strength reduction factor for the design of FRP-confined columns in order to ensure for them the same level of reliability as for conventional unconfined columns. A relationship between the strength reduction factor and the confinement ratio is proposed for FRP-confined columns in axial compression and axial compression with flexure. The influence of reinforcement ratio, live-to-dead load ratio, and eccentricity ratio on reliability of FRP-confined columns is also investigated.

AB - Ritz vectors represent an alternative to mode shapes as suitable basis vectors for n-dimensional system analysis. In numerical studies, these vectors have been shown to offer superior performance in model reduction and time simulations. They also appear to be more sensitive to structural damage than traditional mode shapes. An approach to extract Ritz vectors from measured dynamic data has been developed, and the measured Ritz vectors have been shown to be identical to those obtained using analytical procedures. However, the identification process did not consider the effects of noise in the measured data or the presence of structural damping. In this paper, a new Ritz vector identification algorithm is developed which accounts for the presence of damping. It is shown for the case of proportional or modest structural damping that the new algorithm is able to recover the undamped Ritz vectors from damped structural responses. To address the issue of noise, the first Ritz vector accuracy indicator is developed. The “Twin Ritz Indicator” is shown to be a reliable measure of accuracy for identified Ritz vectors.

AB - The assessment of the reliability of structural systems is increasingly being estimated with regard to the spatial fluctuation of the mechanical properties as well as loads. This leads to a detailed probabilistic modeling known as stochastic finite elements (SFE). In this paper an approach that departs from the main stream of methods for the reliability analysis of SFE models is proposed. The difference lies in that the reliability problem is treated as a classification task and not as the computation of an integral. To this purpose use is made of a kernel method for classification, which is the object of intensive research in pattern recognition, image analysis, and other fields. A greedy sequential procedure requiring a minimal number of limit state evaluations is developed. The algorithm is based on the key concept of support vectors, which guarantee that only the points closest to the decision rule need to be evaluated. The numerical examples show that this algorithm allows obtaining a highly accurate approximation of the failure probability of SFE models with a minimal number of calls of the finite element solver and also a fast computation.
