AB - In this paper, the cracked membrane model is developed into a finite element formulation for the analysis of orthogonally reinforced structural elements in plane stress (such as deep beams and walls). The cracked membrane model falls into the category of “compression field models” combining elemental components from the modified compression field approach with those of the tension chord model. The tension stiffening effect is modeled using a stepped, rigid-plastic steel–concrete bond relationship. The tension stiffening and tension softening components of the concrete tension resistance mechanism are decoupled. As equilibrium is fully satisfied at the cracks and not expressed in terms of average stresses across the element, the link to limit analysis is maintained. The model has been incorporated into a finite element program for the analysis of reinforced concrete structures with verification against experimental data presented.

AB - This paper presents the first series of validation tests for a patented shear reinforcement system for reinforced concrete flat slabs. The system, called “Shearband,” consists of elongated thin steel strips punched with holes, which undulate into the slab from the top surface. The main advantages of the new reinforcement system are structural effectiveness, flexibility, simplicity, and speed of construction. Four reinforced concrete slabs were tested in a specially designed test rig. The slabs reinforced in shear exhibited ductile behavior after achieving their full flexural potential, thus proving the effectiveness of the new reinforcement. This paper reviews briefly existing types of shear reinforcement and identifies the need for more efficient and economic solutions. Details of the experimental setup and results are given, including strain and deflection measurements as well as photographs of sections through the slabs. Finally, comparisons are made with the ACI 318 and BS8110 code predictions, which confirm that the system enabled the slabs to avoid punching shear failure and achieve their flexural potential. In addition, both codes are shown to lead to conservative estimates of flexural and punching shear capacities of reinforced concrete slabs.

AB - This research presents a strengthening technique for increasing punching shear resistance in reinforced concrete flat plates using carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs). This strengthening method employs CFRP strips in the vertical direction as shear reinforcement around the concentrated load area in a specified pattern. Experimental load deflection curves, strain measurements, and failure modes are reported for four strengthened specimens and two reference specimens tested for the research reported here. The results show that, by using a sufficient amount of CFRP strips in an efficient configuration, the failure surface can be shifted away from the column. The load carrying capacities of the strengthened reinforced concrete slabs are increased with increasing amount of vertical CFRP reinforcement used in a wider area. Punching shear strengths of test specimens are augmented up to 51% relative to the control specimens. The pre- and postpunching behavior of the specimen with the highest increase in load carrying capacity is better than that of the reference specimen designed according to the current requirements of ACI 318-02. ACI 318-02 and CEB-FIP Model Code 90 requirements for punching shear design are critically examined in the light of current experimental findings.

AB - A new structural approach that uses composite partial interaction to improve the strength and ductility of rectangular reinforced concrete columns has been studied experimentally. By increasing the compressive resistance of concrete columns, through composite partial interaction such as by bolting a steel plate to the compression face of a column, this new composite action approach is shown to successfully delay concrete crushing in the plastic hinge zone. The experimental results confirm theoretical predictions that composite partial interaction can be used to increase either the strength or ductility (or both) of concrete columns. The paper also briefly describes a design procedure for the retrofit strategy to achieve a specified displacement, or interstory drift.

AB - The purpose of the present study is to identify the local failure of strengthened plates and to derive a separation criterion at the interface between concrete and steel plates. To this end, a comprehensive experimental program has been set up. Double lap pull-out tests that take into consideration pure shear force and half-beam tests that consider combined flexure-shear force were performed. The main experimental parameters include the plate thickness, adhesive thickness, and plate end arrangement. The strain along the longitudinal direction of the steel plates was measured, and the shear stress was calculated from the strain measured. The effects of the plate thickness, bonded length, and plate end treatment are also clarified by the present test results. Nonlinear finite-element analyses were performed and compared with the test results. The interface properties were also modeled to identify the separation failure behavior of strengthened members. The cracking patterns as well as maximum failure loads agree well with test data within error of 1%. The relationship between maximum shear and normal stress at the interface was derived to propose a criterion for separation failure of strengthened members. This study allows more realistic analysis and design of externally strengthened flexural members with steel plates.

AB - Analytical models for the inelastic behavior and ductility capacity of reinforced concrete bridge piers under earthquake are presented. The models for material nonlinearity include tensile, compressive, and shear models for cracked concrete and a model of reinforcing steel where the smeared crack approach is incorporated. An interface element is used to account for local discontinuous deformations at the boundary plane caused by abrupt changes in stiffness where members with different thicknesses are connected. An analytical model is developed to express the confining effects of lateral ties that depend on the amount of transverse reinforcement. Experimental verification and results from numerical simulations are presented in the companion paper.

AB - Analytical models for the inelastic behavior and ductility capacity of reinforced concrete bridge piers under earthquake are presented in Part I of this two-part paper. Part II presents experimental verification and results from numerical simulations. A general purpose finite element analysis program implementing the reinforced concrete plane stress element and the interface element is developed. Nonlinear analysis results for various reinforced concrete bridge piers subjected to given seismic loading show reasonable agreement with the recorded experimental data, and this validates that the models may be appropriately used as constitutive models for inelastic analyses of reinforced concrete bridge piers under earthquake. The displacement ductility capacity is computed for the members, and a seismic design method for reinforced concrete bridge piers considering the response modification factor is discussed.

AB - Until now, the determination of fire resistance of reinforced concrete (RC) columns has essentially been based on tabulated data. Clearly, a more scientific approach based on an understanding of the fundamental behavior of columns in fire is timely and will be useful to structural engineers. This paper develops a simple and rational method to predict the fire resistance of RC columns subjected to four-face heating. The effects of elevated temperature on material deterioration with regard to the strength and stability of the columns are quantified. Both uniaxial and biaxial bending of columns is considered. The computer code SAFIR, developed at the University of Liege, was used to analyze reported experimental results and to simulate the deformation response. The approach comprises three steps. The first step is to determine the respective strength reduction factors of concrete and steel and the modulus of elasticity at elevated temperature on the basis of numerical simulations using SAFIR. The second step is to calculate the balanced failure point of the column, so as to determine whether the applied load eccentricity is small or large. The third step is to determine the failure load by a trial and error process. This method can be regarded as an extension of the existing American Concrete Institute method for ultimate strength predictions of RC columns at ambient temperature.

AB - The paper is concerned with an experimental investigation on simply supported steel–concrete composite plate girders subject to shear loading. Four composite and two bare steel plate girders were tested to failure in order to study their ultimate strength behavior. The effect of composite action with the concrete slab on tension field action in the web panels is the main focus of the study. Extensive strain measurements were made on the web panels in order to measure the extent of tension field action. It is observed from the tests that the ultimate shear capacity of composite plate girders increases significantly compared to bare steel girders. The test specimens were analyzed using finite element modeling and the predicted results compared with the corresponding experimental values. The comparison shows good agreement thus confirming the accuracy of the modeling.

AB - Semirigid moment-resisting frames can provide seismic resistance of buildings if the connections are engineered for ductile behavior. Column–tree construction can utilize splice assemblies to provide stable energy dissipation during lateral movement. Analytical studies showed that global performance was enhanced for a 4-story and 24-story building by switching from rigid to semirigid frame construction. An experimental test was conducted of a candidate connection made from T-shape hot-rolled sections for use in the building frames. The flange plates were tested with cyclic axial loads, approximating the expected loading of a flange splice when the connection rotates as a semirigid frame connection. Yielding of the reduced plate section and slip of the bolts provided stable and ductile behavior. Slip behavior of the bolts remained stable over several cycles and would allow significant rotation of a beam hinge. A comparison of the analytical demand and the experimental capacities obtained from the test specimen showed that the connection design would provide the capacities required during severe ground motions.

AB - Previous research on nailed steel tubular lap splice connections has resulted in the development of design guidelines for shear, bearing, and net section fracture failure modes, for both static and fatigue loading. Since then, new stainless steel powder actuated fasteners (or “nails”) have been developed. This paper thereby presents the outcome of subsequent experimental research on stainless steel nailed lap splice connections. A total of 21 nailed connections, between pairs of tubes and pairs of plates, were tested under static loading and results confirm that current design guidelines are applicable for connections made with stainless steel nails. Furthermore, a total of 16 fatigue tests were conducted and the prior fatigue S-N curves recommended for nailed connections have been modified to accommodate the current experimental data on stainless steel nailed connections. More research is required to develop design guidelines for connections where fatigue bending stresses are present. The benefits of the nailing technique are appreciated in the steel industry, and design guidance is now sufficient to advocate stainless steel powder actuated fasteners as structural connectors.

AB - A beam element is presented for analysis of the elastoplastic large deflection of three-dimensional (3D) frames that have steel members with semirigid joints. A plastic hinge type formulation was employed, combining the “modified incremental stiffness method,” the updated Lagrangian formulation, and numerical integration about the end sections of the element. The end sections of the element are discretized into small areas to estimate the plastic deformations of the element. The elastic and plastic deformations of the element are treated separately. The behavior of a semirigid joint is modeled as the element-end compliance. The method can treat comprehensively the plastic deformations due to torsion and warping. Considering the assumptions of the method, a four-element approximation for a member gives excellent results for a 3D analysis of semirigid and pin-connected steel frames as well as for rigid frames. The adequacy of the method is verified by comparing the results with experimental ones obtained by the writer. Some examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method.

AB - Structures are designed with the intention of safely withstanding ordinary and extreme loads over the entire intended economic lifetime. Designation of appropriate design levels is especially difficult for natural processes, for which many decades of reliable data are desirable, but is often basically unattainable. One such area of interest is the prediction of extreme wind speeds. Recently, multiyear, mechanically recorded data from five sites in the Pacific Northwest were obtained. The data consist of hourly 1-s maximum gust speeds, wind direction, temperature, and barometric pressure. Using these variables, the data are examined by season to determine statistical characteristics, including their dependencies. In particular, histograms of the wind gusts are examined in detail at each location to determine whether they can be modeled by a single probability distribution. Statistical time series analysis is traditionally dependent on the assumption that all observations arise from a single distribution, but recent theoretical advances have been made with mixed distributions in extreme value theory. The suitability of the observed wind data for analysis using mixed distributions is examined, and the peaks-over-threshold technique is applied. The results are compared to those obtained by assuming the data arise from a single distribution. Rather striking results indicate the importance of the mixed distribution approach, including seasonal and direction variations. We also note that the theory of mixed distributions in extreme value theory can be applied to any data for which extremal computations are desired.

AB - This paper presents the results of a series of experiments on a full-scale one-story L-shaped woodframe house. The major objective of the experiments was to collect data for use in the validation of analytical models, and to examine the load redistribution in a nonsymmetrical light-frame structure under lateral loading. In these experiments, the distribution of the reaction forces underneath the walls, and the displaced shape of the house were measured in detail under static and static–cyclic loading. The experimental results have provided the most detailed picture of the reaction forces beneath a nonsymmetrical light-frame structure under lateral loading ever recorded. It was shown that there is potential for significant sharing and redistribution of applied lateral load, between the main shear walls of a light-frame house under both pseudoelastic and inelastic response conditions. Commonly used techniques for lateral load distribution in light-frame structures do not accommodate redistribution of the loading between the walls in the structure.
