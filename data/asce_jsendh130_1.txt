AB - This paper is concerned with the failure of lightly reinforced concrete members under fire conditions, with particular emphasis given to the catenary action arising from axial restraint at the supports and the ensuing rupture of the reinforcement. The relevance of this work stems from the need to make a fundamental step toward understanding the conditions that influence the failure of a steel-decked composite floor slab, which is shown to become effectively lightly reinforced at elevated temperature. A new analytical model is proposed for lightly reinforced members subject to axial restraint, which accounts for the compressive arch and tensile catenary stages, bond-slip, yielding, and rupture of the steel reinforcement as well as the effect of elevated temperature. The versatility of the proposed model and the conditions which govern its validity are illustrated in this paper through comparisons with detailed computations based on nonlinear finite element analysis. The companion paper utilizes the proposed analytical model to perform a parametric investigation into the factors influencing the failure of lightly reinforced members, and to highlight key implications for structural fire resistance design.

AB - This paper deals with the behavior of lightly reinforced concrete members under fire conditions, focusing on the failure state associated with rupture of the reinforcement. The work transpires from the need to examine the underlying mechanisms related to the failure of composite floor slabs, which become effectively lightly reinforced in a fire situation due to the early loss of the steel deck. The analytical model proposed in the companion paper is utilized to perform a parametric investigation into the salient factors influencing the failure of lightly reinforced restrained members. A detailed account of the analytical results is given, and the relative importance of the main material and geometric parameters is illustrated. It is shown that in addition to temperature effects, the bond characteristics, member length, and the steel material response have a direct and significant influence on failure. The implications on structural fire resistance are highlighted, and simplified expressions for failure prediction, which capture the effect of key parameters, are proposed. This work provides a necessary step toward a fundamental methodology which may be employed for developing quantified failure criteria, with a view to the provision of more rational performance based approaches for structural fire design.

AB - It was observed on a pedestrian cable-stayed bridge that the girder vibrated laterally with a frequency of about 0.9 Hz, the natural frequency of the first lateral mode, when a large number of people crossed the bridge. This girder response depended on the number of pedestrians but some pedestrians occasionally felt uncomfortable and unsafe. The girder was excited by the lateral dynamic force which was produced by the zigzag movement of pedestrians. Once the bridge started to vibrate, some of the pedestrians synchronized with the girder vibration, which further increased the girder response. However, when the vibration reached a certain level, pedestrians modified their walking and the girder response stayed at that level. A dynamic model was proposed to evaluate the pedestrians’ synchronized dynamic forces. Overall behavior of the girder response calculated by this dynamic model agreed with the measured values on the bridge. It was found by parametric studies that the smaller bridge damping and the smaller bridge mass produced the larger girder response. The higher pedestrian density also increased the girder response unless they were too crowded to walk normally.

AB - This study evaluates the properties of superelastic Ni–Ti shape memory alloys under cyclic loading to assess their potential for applications in seismic resistant design and retrofit. Shape memory alloy wire and bars are tested to evaluate the effect of bar size and loading history on the strength, equivalent damping, and recentering properties of the shape memory alloys in superelastic form. The bars are tested under both quasistatic and dynamic loading. The results show that nearly ideal superelastic properties can be obtained in both wire and bar form of the superelastic Ni–Ti shape memory alloys. However, the wire form of the shape memory alloys show higher strength and damping properties compared with the bars. The recentering capabilities (based on residual strains) are not affected by section size. Overall, the damping potential of shape memory alloys in superelastic form is low for both wire and bars, typically less than 7% equivalent viscous damping. Cyclical strains greater than 6% lead to degradation in the damping and recentering properties of the shape memory alloys. Strain rate effects are evaluated by subjecting the shape memory alloys to loading rates representative of typical seismic loading. The results show that increased loading rates lead to decreases in the equivalent damping, but have negligible effects on the recentering properties of the shape memory alloys.

AB - The well-known modal superposition method for the evaluation of seismic response by the complete quadratic modal combination rule (CQC) is revisited. The most widely used version of the CQC rule utilizes correlation coefficients derived for white-noise excitation and neglects the influence of peak factor variation on the response. Here a simplified procedure for evaluation of correlation coefficients and peak factors consistent with the power spectral density of seismic excitation is proposed. The procedure is based on an approximate analytic expression for direct evaluation of the power spectral density of the excitation consistent with any prefixed response spectrum, and the evaluation of the consistent correlation coefficients and peak factors by using analytical expressions. The ranges of system dynamic parameters for which the correlation coefficients derived for white-noise excitation are not adequate are pointed out. Then the influence of the assumptions for CQC rule derivation on the evaluation of nodal response parameters is investigated, and the role played by the correlation coefficients and peak factors is pointed out.

AB - This paper introduces a new analytical approach for the evaluation of shear strength and cracking pattern of masonry infill panels. This method is based on minimizing the factor of safety with reference to the failure surfaces. This approach can also be used to determine the shear strength parameters and the modulus of elasticity of brickwork material. The paper also presents the results of experimental and analytical investigations on repaired and strengthened brick infilled steel frames. Two main repair techniques were examined in which the corner material is replaced with concrete or a concrete cover is placed on the panel. Both experiment and analysis have confirmed the efficiency and adequacy of these techniques.

AB - This paper develops a simple advanced method of designing steel members against out-of-plane failure, in which reduced elastic moduli are used in an out-of-plane buckling analysis to model the effects of high moment, residual stresses and geometrical imperfections on yielding. The reduced moduli are derived from the basic beam and column strength curves of the Australian steel code AS4100 in 1998. The strengths predicted for simply supported beams in uniform bending are exactly the same as those of AS4100, while those for simply supported columns are extremely close. The strengths predicted for simply supported beam-columns with equal and opposite end moments are a little higher than the less conservative predictions of AS4100, and are very close to the basic beam and column strengths when these are plotted against a consistent generalized slenderness. The strengths predicted for simply supported beams under double curvature bending are somewhat less than those of the AS4100 method of design by buckling analysis, while those for beams with central concentrated loads acting at or away from the centroid are very close, and those for end restrained beams under uniform bending and for sway columns are generally a little higher. While the method has been developed from and compared with the Australian code AS4100, it may be modified for any other modern code for the design of steel structures. It may be more widely applied to two-dimensional frames with in-plane loading, as part of a simple method of advanced analysis in which separate assessments are made of the in-plane and out-of plane strengths.

AB - This paper reports on the experimental studies on the durability of galvanized light-gauge steel shapes with thickness up to 1.6 mm, inclusive of screw connections. The durability of these shapes and screw connections was examined by cyclic accelerated corrosion tests and shear tests on corroded connections. The test results show that the corrosion rate of shapes depends primarily on the method of galvanizing and that the corrosion rate of Al/Zn-coating (5% aluminum and 55% aluminum) is less than that of common Zn-coating. Also it was clarified that no corrosion of the screwed parts of shapes and screws was observed after the accelerated corrosion test and the shear strength did not decline, even the coating thickness of screws was 5 μm. Thus, according to these test results, the durability of galvanized light-gauge steel shapes was clarified, and from comparison with the data obtained in the conventional outdoor exposure test, the service life of shapes in outdoor application can be estimated.

AB - A simple linear beam idealization of a cold-formed steel portal frame is presented in which beam elements are used to idealize the column and rafter members, and rotational spring elements are used to represent the rotational flexibility of the joints. In addition, the beam idealization takes into account the finite connection length of the joints. Deflections predicted using the beam idealization are shown to be comparable to deflections obtained from both a linear finite element shell idealization and full-scale laboratory tests. Using the beam idealization, deflections under rafter load are divided into three components: Deflection due to flexure of the column and rafter members, deflection due to bolt-hole elongation, and deflection due to in-plane bracket deformation. Of these deflection components, the deflection due to bolt-hole elongation is the most significant and cannot, therefore, be ignored. Using the beam idealization, engineers can analyze and design cold-formed steel portal frames, including making appropriate allowances for connection effects, without the need to resort to expensive finite element shell analysis.

AB - A finite-element model of a buried pipeline consisting of concrete pressure pipe segments and joints is developed for analysis of longitudinal effects resulting from pressure-induced thrust at a bend. The model accounts for longitudinal pipe-to-soil friction, soil stiffness against transverse movement of the pipe, tensile softening of concrete, yielding of steel cylinder, and the nonlinear behavior of the joint. The model is applied to the analysis of simple bends designed following the current thrust restraint design procedure. The results show that for the pipes installed in stiff backfill, the current thrust restraint design procedure is adequate, although not with uniform safety factor over the range of all possible bend angles. However, the current thrust restraint design procedure does not protect the pipes installed in soft highly plastic, clayey soils against failure. Based on the results of the finite-element model, a new design procedure is developed that accounts for thrust resistance by a combination of longitudinal soil friction and soil stiffness against transverse movement of the pipe. The results of finite-element analysis of the designs by this procedure show adequate safety over the range of bend angles and soil stiffness values.

AB - Genetic algorithms (GAs), based on a multipoint search method and a crossover operation, are useful search procedures for combinatorial optimization problems. They also are applied to many kinds of practical optimization problem. However, in general, the GAs have a tendency to decrease rapidly of population diversities in processes of searching. In order to address this drawback, some researchers have proposed new algorithms for maintaining the population diversity. On the other hand, immune algorithms (IAs) are optimization techniques that imitate immune systems in an organism. The IAs are able to obtain a multiple quasi-optimum solution while maintaining the population diversity compared with GAs. In this paper, in order to consider the application of the IAs to optimum structural design problems, we developed a useful design support system for reinforced concrete (RC) slabs by combining a three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear dynamic finite element method (FEM) and an improved immune algorithm (IA). For the analysis of impact failure behavior of RC slabs, layered nonlinear FEM models with thin plate bending elements, and 3D elastoplastic FEM models with eight-node isoparametric hexahedral elements were used. First, an existing IA was modified to make it suitable for RC slab design, and both genetic and immune algorithms were applied to optimization problems with multiple optimum solutions. This modified IA was also applied to quasi-optimization problems with multiple maximum values. By comparing the above two approaches, the usefulness of the IA for design problems with discrete parameters was verified. Next, indices for evaluating impact resistance were discussed, and design simulation was conducted, based on these indices, by combining the layered nonlinear FEM and the IA. From results obtained, the accuracy and usefulness of the IA-based design support system were discussed. For obtaining a more practical design support system, shear reinforcement will be taken into account by combining the IA with the 3D elastoplastic FEM. Furthermore, the effectiveness and future potential of the design support system were confirmed by investigating an effect of introducing a database of design plans.

AB - Classical control algorithms such as the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) algorithms have been used for structural control problems over the past three decades. These algorithms suffer from a number of fundamental shortcomings. They are susceptible to parameter uncertainty and modeling error. They present optimum solutions in a narrow sense only because the external excitation term is ignored in their formulation and solution. These algorithms achieve a significant level of attenuation in the vicinity of the natural frequencies of the structure. But, they fail to suppress the vibrations when frequency of the external disturbance differs even slightly from the natural frequencies of the structure. In this paper, a hybrid feedback-least mean square (LMS) algorithm is presented for control of structures through integration of a feedback control algorithm such as the LQR or LQG algorithm and the filtered-x LMS algorithm. The algorithm is applied to the active tuned mass damper system. It is shown that the hybrid feedback-LMS algorithm minimizes vibrations over the entire frequency range and thus is less susceptible to modeling error and inherently more stable.

AB - In a companion article, the writers presented a hybrid feedback-least mean square (LMS) algorithm for control of structures through integration of a feedback control algorithm such as the linear quadratic regulator and linear quadratic Gaussian algorithms and the filtered-x LMS algorithm. Low-pass filtering of dynamic environmental disturbance signals due to winds and earthquakes is required when the hybrid feedback-LMS algorithm is used for control of civil structures, because the frequency bandwidths of such environmental signals are much wider than those of common structural systems. In this paper, it is shown that the wavelet transform can be used as an effective filtering scheme for control problems. A wavelet-hybrid feedback-LMS algorithm is presented for robust control of civil structures. The effectiveness of the proposed control model is demonstrated by application to an active tuned mass damper system and an active mass driver benchmark problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model is effective for control of both steady and transient vibrations without any significant additional computational burden, and can be used readily to enhance the performance of existing feedback control algorithms.

AB - Monte Carlo simulation is used to quantify the reliability of reinforced concrete cantilever beams without stirrups designed using ASCE 7-98 load factors with strength reduction factors given in Appendix C of ACI 318-99 and the main body of ACI 318-02. Limit states corresponding to flexural failure neglecting strain hardening of the reinforcement, flexural failure considering strain hardening, and bond failure are investigated for various dead-to-live load ratios, reinforcing bar sizes, and flexural reinforcement ratios. Development lengths for the simulated beams were computed using ACI 318-02 Eq. (12-1). Computed mean-value, first-order, second-moment reliability indices confirm the simulation results, but in all cases slightly overestimate the reliability. Bond failures are more probable than flexural failures, and more probable for beams with small diameter bars than for beams with large diameter bars. Flexure and bond reliabilities are lower for the beams designed to ACI 318-02 than for the beams designed to ACI 318-99 for reinforcement ratios less than 0.023. Flexural reliability indices are more consistent for the beams designed to ACI 318-02, but bond reliability indices are more variable. To improve the consistency and magnitude of bond reliability indices for beams designed to ACI 318-02 the reinforcement bar size factor γ could be increased from 0.8 to 0.85 and development lengths could be increased by 22 to 27% for small diameter bars and up to 19% for large diameter bars. The bar size factor may have to be increased further to accommodate bars with confining reinforcement and also reinforcement detailed using the simplified equations in Section 12.2.2 of ACI 318-02.

AB - In the era of modernization, solid round steel bars are widely used in communication towers, which play a vital role in today’s world. Solid steel round bars are used as leg members, diagonal members, and horizontal members of a communication tower. Canadian Standard for Antenna towers and Antenna Supporting Structures, CAN/CSA-S37-01, specifies empirical expressions for the compressive strength of solid rounds based on the well-known Structural Stability Research Council column strength curves for nonsolid-round members as well as on the results from an experimental investigation on the compressive resistance of solid rounds carried out back to 1965. This paper provides a summary of the available literature on the compressive strength of solid rounds. Also, the results of the recently tested six large solid round bars at Ryerson University, Toronto, are presented. Correlation between the results from these tests and the current practice for the design of solid rounds is investigated. It is expected that the results from this paper direct the attention of code writers to more economical and safe empirical expressions for the ultimate compressive resistance of solid rounds. This would assist the practicing engineers in the evaluation of the load-carrying capacity of existing antenna towers since even a small increase in strength for live load can make the difference between demolishing a tower or leaving it in service.
