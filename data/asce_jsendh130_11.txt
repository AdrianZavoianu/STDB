AB - A method based on nonlinear pushover analysis is proposed to quantify the deterministic and probabilistic effects of redundancy on the strength of structural systems. Two indices, the redundancy strength index and the redundancy variation index, are introduced to measure these effects. Simplified expressions are developed and presented to calculate these indices. The redundancy strength and the redundancy variation indices are evaluated for plane reinforced concrete frames with different stories, a different number of vertical lines of resistance, and various beam ductility capacity ratios. How the member ductility capacity and the structural geometry affects the redundancy strength and the redundancy variation index is discussed.

AB - The effects of the element ductility capacity, the flexibility of beams (in terms of the beam span-to-beam depth ratio), the flexibility of columns (in terms of column slenderness ratio), and the level of gravity loads on the structural redundancy of plane frames are studied. A simplified expression to evaluate the redundancy response modification factor RR and account for the effects of plan and vertical irregularity on the strength of framing systems in a direct and scientific manner is presented. The required parameters involved in the expression can be obtained from a nonlinear pushover analysis of a structure. The redundancy response modification factor is evaluated for a group of two-dimensional frames with 3, 5, and 7 stories and 1, 2, 4, and 6 bays. Finally a simplified expression for the reliability or safety index β is formulated and applied to the same group of structures.

AB - A statistical study of the damping reduction factors considered the effects of site classes from 1,037 acceleration time histories are presented. The factors are computed from the displacement and acceleration response spectra of single-degree-of-freedom systems undergoing different levels of damping ratios. Considered here is three types of soil condition characterized by site Classes A–D in accordance with the NEHRP 2000 Provisions. Effects of period of vibration, level of damping ratio and site class on the damping reduction factors are evaluated and discussed. The study shows that if an analytic error of 5% for structural design is acceptable, the effect of site conditions on the damping reduction factor derived from the displacement response spectrum can be neglected only for systems with damping ratios smaller than 20%, whereas this effect can be disregarded even for the 50% damped systems if an analytic error of 10% can be endured. Furthermore, the factors derived from the acceleration response spectrum are more sensitive to site classes than those derived from the displacement response spectrum. For the damping reduction factors obtained from the acceleration response spectrum, the effect of soil conditions can be neglected only for systems with damping ratios smaller than 10% if an error of 5% for structural design is allowable while this effect can be omitted just for systems with damping ratios smaller than 20% if an error of 10% is permissible. Expressions obtained from nonlinear regression analyses are proposed in the end of this paper to estimate the damping reduction factors derived from the displacement and acceleration responses.

AB - The paper summarizes the feasibility study of implementing seismic protective systems into high-tech industrial structures in which costly vibration-sensitive facilities are housed. Due to the fact that the microvibration of an existing integrated circuit (IC) fab structure plays an important role in affecting the chip probe yield of manufacturing and the reliability of chip products, the paper has emphasized on the microvibration analysis and measurement of a test structure before and after the seismic protective systems have been incorporated. The theoretical background of one-third octave frequency spectra is derived. Based on the study, it is found that the incorporation of viscous dampers will not only enhance the seismic safety but also minimize the microvibration of the structure. The seismic isolation design is the most promising method to achieve the “fully operational” seismic performance level of an IC fab. However, the amplification of the microvibration at the low frequency range due to the implementation of seismic isolation design will require further study to ascertain its effect on the operation of vibration-sensitive facilities.

AB - The paper reports progress in the development of a practical probabilistic model for the estimation of expected annual damage induced by hurricane winds in residential structures. The estimation of the damage is accomplished in several steps. First, basic damage modes for components of specific building types are defined. Second, the damage modes are combined in possible damage states, whose probabilities of occurrence are calculated as functions of wind speeds from Monte Carlo simulations conducted on engineering numerical models of typical houses. The paper describes the conceptual framework for the proposed model, and illustrates its application for a specific building type with hypothetical probabilistic input. Actual probabilistic input must be based on laboratory studies, postdamage surveys, insurance claims data, engineering analyses and judgment, and Monte Carlo simulation methods. The proposed component-based model is flexible and transparent. It is therefore capable of being readily scrutinized. The model can be used in conjunction with historical loss data, to which it can readily be calibrated.

AB - Parameters affecting the shear strength of reinforced concrete columns having a rectangular cross section and light transverse reinforcement are investigated using data from numerous column tests. A new model is proposed to predict the column shear strength based on theoretical formulations and experimental evidence. The proposed shear strength equation includes contributions from the concrete and transverse reinforcement. Primary parameters in the shear strength model are the column cross-sectional dimensions, concrete compressive strength, column aspect ratio, axial load, and displacement ductility demand. The proposed model is compared with other shear strength models using the available column test data and is shown to result in improved accuracy. A conservative shear strength model for use in design and assessment is proposed based on statistical evaluation of computed and actual shear strengths.

AB - Life-cycle cost analysis of deteriorating structures has to consider not only time-varying resistance and loading affecting the reliability of these structures but also maintenance interventions applied during their lifetime. Finding the optimum maintenance scenario for a deteriorating structure is a complex process involving the selection of maintenance interventions and their application times associated with minimum life-cycle cost. There is a close relationship between maintenance intervention cost and the effect of the intervention on system reliability. However, this relationship is not included in modern structural management systems since costs of interventions are prescribed as fixed values independent on their effects on system reliability. Neglecting the interactions among maintenance interventions, their effects on structural performance, and corresponding costs leads to significant limitations of modern management systems for civil infrastructures. In this paper, maintenance intervention cost is not considered to be fixed but evaluated dynamically by using cost functions according to time-dependent variables related to the quality of intervention. The main advantages of using cost functions are the flexibility and expandability required for general purpose reliability-based structure management systems. In fact, cost functions can be used in any structure management system based on life-cycle cost. A practical example is provided to show how to establish cost functions of maintenance interventions and how these functions can be used to obtain the optimal life-cycle maintenance scenario.

AB - One important application of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites in the retrofit of reinforced concrete structures is to provide confinement to columns for enhanced strength and ductility. As a result, many theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out on FRP-confined concrete. This paper provides a critical review of existing studies, with the emphasis being on the revelation of the fundamental behavior of FRP-confined concrete and the modeling of this behavior. Aspects covered in this paper include stress–strain behavior, dilation properties, ultimate condition, and stress–strain models. The paper concludes with a brief outline of issues which require further research. Although the paper is explicitly limited to concrete confined by FRP jackets in which the fibers are oriented only or predominantly in the hoop direction, many of the observations made in this paper are also applicable or relevant to concrete confined by FRP jackets with a significant axial stiffness, as found in concrete-filled FRP tubes as new columns.

AB - This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of durability analysis and lifetime assessment of concrete structures under the diffusive attack from external aggressive agents. The proposed formulation mainly refers to beams and frames, but it can be easily extended also to other types of structures. The diffusion process is modeled by using cellular automata. The mechanical damage coupled to diffusion is evaluated by introducing suitable material degradation laws. Since the rate of mass diffusion usually depends on the stress state, the interaction between the diffusion process and the mechanical behavior of the damaged structure is also taken into account by a proper modeling of the stochastic effects in the mass transfer. To this aim, the nonlinear structural analyses during time are performed within the framework of the finite element method by means of a deteriorating reinforced concrete beam element. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology in handling complex geometrical and mechanical boundary conditions is demonstrated through some applications. Firstly, a reinforced concrete box girder cross section is considered and the damaging process is described by the corresponding evolution of both bending moment–curvature diagrams and axial force-bending moment resistance domains. Secondly, the durability analysis of a reinforced concrete continuous T-beam is developed. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to the analysis of an existing arch bridge and to the identification of its critical members.

AB - A numerical formulation of the mixed-mode (mode-I and mode-II) fracture in concrete based on the extended fictitious crack model is presented. For crack propagation, the maximum principal stress criterion is used, assuming that the mode-I condition is dominant at the tip of a mixed-mode crack. A main feature of this study is that normal and tangential tractions are applied directly to the crack surface, following specific tension-softening and shear-transfer laws. To verify the approach, two well-known experimental problems are solved. The first is the single-notched shear beam test by Arrea and Ingraffea, and the second is the scale-model test of gravity dams by Carpinteri et al. Varying the shear-transfer characteristics on the crack surface, the numerical model predicts distinct transitions from the mode-I fracture to the mixed-mode fracture in the structural response and the crack path, which both show reasonable agreement with experimental observations. The issue of stress singularity in finite-element computations of tip tensile forces is also addressed.

AB - A particular method for determining the critical load of linear structures partially or totally located in different elastic media is presented. It can be used to calculate the buckling load of pile–columns (columns partially embedded in soil), for instance. The buried part of the linear structure could pass through different soil layers, and the whole structure could be restrained at any point. The algorithm proposed is based on the fact that the stiffness matrix of an element in an elastic medium depends on the axial load exerted on that element. Therefore, when the axial load becomes critical from the point of view of the element’s stability, the corresponding flexibility matrix tends to infinity. Above-ground structures are assumed to be in an elastic medium with a very low coefficient of reaction. The paper describes the method in detail through different examples, and provides the flowchart of the algorithm used for the iterative calculations.

AB - The design of cold-formed steel channels with complex stiffeners could be quite tedious in calculating the effective area using the effective width method in the current design rules of North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard. The direct strength method could be used in the design without calculating the effective area. An experimental investigation of fixed-ended cold-formed steel channel columns with complex edge stiffeners has been reported. The test strengths were compared with design strengths predicted using the direct strength method as well as the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. The failure modes observed in the tests were also compared with the failure modes predicted by the direct strength method. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the direct strength method are generally conservative for the channel columns with complex edge stiffeners. Furthermore, the reliability of the direct strength method was evaluated using reliability analysis. It is shown that the direct strength method is reliable using the existing resistance factor as recommended by the current North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard.

AB - The paper presents strength equations for single stainless steel stiffened elements applicable to the range of alloys included in the American, Australian, and European standards for stainless steel structures. Cold-formed sections with stiffened elements are considered and the enhanced mechanical properties of the corners are taken into account to show that the Winter equation may or may not conservatively predict the strength, depending on the corner area relative to the area of the flat part. The paper shows that the Winter equation may be used safely for the design of stiffened elements provided half of the area of the adjacent corners exceeds 10-15% of the flat area, depending on the alloy and whether the section is cold-rolled or brake-pressed. An equation is derived for determining the reduction factor to be applied to the Winter strength when the minimum corner area requirement is not met. The reduction factor is less than 10% for practical sections.

AB - This paper describes a series of compression tests performed on stub columns fabricated from cold-formed high strength steel plates with nominal yield stress of 550MPa. The steel is classified as G550 to Australia Standard AS1397. The test results presented in this paper are the first stage of an Australian Research Council research project entitled “Compression stability of high strength steel sections with low strain-hardening.” The tests include lipped-square and hexagonal sections, including 94 box-shaped fix-ended stub columns. The purpose of these tests was to determine the influence of low strain hardening of G550 steel on the compressive section capacities of the column members. The results of the successful stub column tests have been compared with the design procedures in the Australian/New Zealand Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structures and recent (1999) amendments to the American Iron and Steel Institute Specification. As expected, the greatest effect of low strain hardening was for the stockier sections where material properties play an important role. For the more slender sections where elastic local buckling and postlocal buckling are more important, the effect of low strain hardening does not appear to be as significant. This is contrary to recent design proposals in the USA where it was proposed that the more slender sections would be more greatly influenced by low strain hardening. A simple proposal for improved design capacity is given in the paper. A second companion paper (Part II) describes a series of compression tests on long columns made from the same material.

AB - This paper describes a series of compression tests performed on long columns fabricated from cold-formed high strength steel plates with nominal yield stress of 550MPa. The steel is classified as G550 to Australia Standard AS1397. The test results presented in this paper are the second stage of an Australian Research Council research project entitled “Compression stability of high strength steel sections with low strain-hardening.” A total of 28 long columns, which were made from two thicknesses of sheet steel (0.42 and 0.6mm), were tested. A box shaped section was tested between pinned ends over a range of lengths. This paper shows the comparison of loads obtained experimentally with those predicted on the basis of AS/NZS 4600 and the AISI specification including Supplement No. 1, 1999. The finite element program, ABAQUS, was also used to simulate the column behavior. For sections which undergo local instability at loads significantly less than the ultimate loads, the column design rules in AS/NZS 4600 and the AISI Specification are unconservative if used in their current form for G550 steel. Proposals for improved column design of high strength slender sections are proposed in this paper. A first companion paper (Part I) describes a series of compassion tests on stub columns.

AB - This paper proposes a new welding-based solution that significantly increases the rotation capacity of a stiffened welded knee joint between cold-formed rectangular hollow sections under opening moment. The proposed solution is more economical than the use of internal sleeves and can be applied to new as well as existing structures. The solution involves the use of extra layers of weld on the inner (tension) flange of a stiffened welded knee joint. Laboratory test results are presented to demonstrate that the solution enabled such a joint between DuraGal C450 150×50×4 or 150×50×5 rectangular hollow sections manufactured to AS 1163 to satisfy the rotation capacity requirement specified for plastic design of steel frames. The reason why the new solution results in increased rotation capacities is explained in terms of strain redistribution and strain reduction in the tensile regions around the knee joints.

AB - Cold-formed C channel sections have been used in portal frame construction for agricultural and light industrial sheds for many years in Australia. The knee joint designs have been copied from hot-rolled portal frames, regardless of the fact that many designers believe this is not realistic. Earlier testing conducted at the Univ. of South Australia demonstrated that these concerns were justified and that the joint designs widely used in practice do not match the moment capacity of the sections and fail prematurely. An alternative joint design has been developed using self-drilling screws. The joint demonstrates excellent moment capacity and rigidity, and is simple to design. A similar joint has also been examined for the ridge connections, which are at a lower angle than the knee joints. This paper describes the development and testing of the self-drilling screw joints, as well as summarizing testing of the conventional joints.

AB - The strength and seismic behavior of a composite column may be used to assess the potential damage caused by fire and help to establish an approach to calculate the structural fire protection for minimum postfire repair. This paper provides new test data pertaining to the seismic behavior of concrete-filled hollow structural steel (HSS) columns after exposure to fire. The test parameters included the sectional types, the fire duration time and the axial load level (n). Thirteen concrete-filled HSS column specimens, including seven specimens with circular sections and six specimens with square sections were tested under constant axial load and cyclically increasing flexural loading. Comparisons are made with predicted column strengths and flexural stiffness using the existing codes. It was found that concrete-filled HSS columns after exposure to fire exhibit very high levels of energy dissipation and ductility. Generally, the energy dissipation ability of the columns with circular sections was much higher than those of the specimens with square sections. The work in this paper provides a basis for further theoretical study on the seismic behavior of concrete-filled HSS columns after exposure to fire.

AB - Currently, the design of reinforced concrete (RC) columns is essentially based on tabulated data. A more scientific approach based on an understanding of the fundamental behavior of columns in fire is useful to structural engineers. Tan and Yao in 2003 developed a simple and rational design method to predict the fire resistance of 4-face heated RC columns. The predictions of the proposed method agree well with test results. The same method can be extended to 1-, 2-, and 3-face heated columns with some modifications. The effects of elevated temperature on material deterioration with regard to the strength and stability of columns are quantified. Furthermore, the shift of neutral axis due to nonsymmetric heating is predicted in the proposed method. For columns under 1- or 3-face heating, only uniaxial bending needs to be considered, but for 2-face heating, the effect of biaxial bending is taken into account. A finite element code SAFIR, developed at the University of Liege, Belgium, was used to benchmark the proposed simplified calculation method.

AB - Beneficial system behavior has been acknowledged in the design of repetitive-member systems. Current design specifications for wood (both National Design Specification and LRFD) permit the use of a repetitive-member factor to account for load-sharing or redistribution of load between framing members and partial composite action. The factors, however, were developed based on a simple statistical model rather than a more rigorous or comprehensive analytical study. The paper reports on a study to investigate load-sharing and system effects in light-frame wall systems and evaluate system factors for codified design that rationally account for load sharing and other system behavior. An objective at the study was to develop system factors that could be used in the design of individual wall members, much as repetitive member factors are used in the design of parallel-member floor and roof systems. Wall studs typically are much smaller in cross section than floor joists. In addition to having greater flexibility than floors, wood stud walls may be subject to the actions of combined loads and their load-sharing behavior may be influenced significantly by the presence of openings. A single system factor may, in fact, not be adequate to account for a wide range of system configurations, loading types, and so forth. This paper presents a new framework based on partial system factors to account for different system effects in parallel-member wood systems.

AB - Compared with simply supported beams, continuous steel–concrete composite beams have many advantages such as higher span/depth ratio, less deflection, and higher fundamental frequency of vibration due to its higher stiffness. However, in negative bending regions near interior supports, tension in concrete is unfavorable and a complicated issue, which deserves a special study. In this paper, a mechanics model based on elastic theory was established to investigate the stiffness of composite beams in negative bending regions by considering slips at the steel beam–concrete slab interface and concrete–reinforcement interface. In order to validate this approach, a test of three composite beams with profiled sheeting under negative bending was conducted. Meanwhile, a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis was conducted to investigate the general behavior of the tested specimens. In addition, a comparative analysis between results derived from the analytical model, laboratory test, and FE analysis was performed. The results show that slip always exists for composite beams under negative bending even with complete shear connection (full composite action) between the steel and concrete components. The slip effect results in an additional curvature of beam bending and reduces the section stiffness by 10–20% compared with that of a beam without any slip in serviceability condition. This reduction should be considered in designing process especially for cantilever beams. Formulae under other loading cases and boundary conditions were also proposed. The results can serve as a basis for further study on stiffness of continuous steel–concrete composite beams and can directly be used for the deflection calculation of cantilever beams.

AB - Unsymmetrical loads along the frame beams produce unequal axial forces in columns together with primary bending moments in the frame members. The combined effect of these two factors on the elastic buckling loads of the frames is studied. The case of one concentrated load acts at different locations on the frame beams is chosen as an example to study the effect of aforementioned factors. The analysis is applied on different types of structural systems such as braced and unbraced multistory frames. Parameters such as fixed and hinged bases, beam to column bending stiffness ratios, and beam span to column height ratios are considered. In addition, the effect of the axial stiffness of the bracing elements is taken into account. The matrix displacement method of analysis has been used throughout the study. The geometric nonlinear behavior of the members is considered by using the stability functions to modify the stiffness matrix of the individual members. Results clearly show that the combined action of the primary bending moments along with the variation of loads ratios on columns has considerable effect on the elastic buckling loads of the braced planar frames.
