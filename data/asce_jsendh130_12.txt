AB - The reliability of civil infrastructure is time variant. This is due to strength deterioration and time-variant mechanical and environmental loadings. Demands for keeping civil infrastructure in functional and reliable states require maintenance interventions. Limited financial resources require optimal maintenance strategies. These strategies have to consider the effects of uncertainties not only on the structural reliability deterioration but also on the maintenance interventions. In this paper, a simulation-based method for predicting reliability index profiles of deteriorating bridges associated with both time- and performance-controlled maintenance interventions is introduced. The method provides a computational procedure which can handle various types of maintenance interventions in a consistent manner. This method also includes an advanced cost model which takes into account the interaction between costs of maintenance interventions and their effect on system reliability. Examples are presented demonstrating the application of computational procedure to a stock of existing deteriorating bridges under various maintenance scenarios.

AB - A general method for lifetime performance analysis of existing steel girder bridges is presented. Only the superstructure components are considered. The formulation is established by identifying four distinct categories: limit state equations, random variables, deterministic parameters, and constant coefficients. The limit state equations are derived by strictly adhering to the load and capacity formulas and requirements set forth in AASHTO specifications. Generality is pursued by establishing parametric limit state equations such that the formulas are applicable to any type of steel bridge having similar superstructure components. The application of the developed formulation to lifetime performance analysis of four steel girder bridges located in an existing bridge network in Colorado is also presented. Performance analysis results are presented in two main categories: initial reliability indices and lifetime reliability profiles. Once the values associated with random variables, deterministic parameters, and constant coefficients are assigned, component reliability indices for the slab and the girders are calculated for each bridge. Detailed results are presented for an individual bridge and the lifetime reliability profiles are presented for two bridges. For time-variant performance analysis, special emphasis is placed on the corrosion penetration modeling in the girders. An attempt has been made to adopt such models to the atmospheric and environmental conditions of Colorado. Limitations to such an approach are also described. The focus of the paper is on the formulation and the overall methodology rather than the analysis of the results.

AB - A general methodology for lifetime performance analysis of existing prestressed concrete girder bridges is presented. Only the superstructure components (slab and girders) are considered. The framework for the methodology is established by identifying four distinct categories: limit state equations, random variables, deterministic parameters, and constant coefficients. The limit state equations are derived by strictly adhering to the load and capacity formulas and requirements set forth in AASHTO specifications. Generality is pursued by establishing parametric limit state equations such that the formulas are applicable to any type of prestressed concrete bridge having similar superstructure components. For time-variant performance analysis, special emphasis is placed on the corrosion penetration modeling in prestressed concrete girders. The developed methodology is applied to seven existing bridges located in Colorado to obtain the lifetime performance of these prestressed concrete girder bridges in the bridge network. Once the values associated with random variables, deterministic parameters, and constant coefficients are assigned, component reliability indices for the slab and the girders are calculated for each bridge. Detailed results are presented for an individual bridge, whereas the lifetime reliability profiles are presented for selected bridges. The focus of the paper is on the formulation and the overall methodology rather than analysis of the results.

AB - Equations in design standards for determining the block shear capacity of coped steel beams vary significantly. In many cases, they predict capacities considerably higher than those determined experimentally. Moreover, relatively few block shear tests on coped steel beams have been conducted. A reliability analysis was completed based on the results of 36 tests on coped wide-flange beams, including 17 new full-scale tests, in order to determine the level of safety being provided by current design standards in North America, with equations from European and Japanese design standards being considered as alternatives. It was found that these standards do not consistently provide an acceptable level of safety and that the strength of two-line connections is often overpredicted by a considerable margin. To address these shortcomings, a simple new equation is proposed for design that provides both an adequate and consistent level of safety and provides good results over a broad array of connection configurations. It also reflects the failure mode that has been observed consistently in tests.

AB - This paper presents an analytical probabilistic based design procedure for concentrically loaded compression members of fiber-reinforced polymeric composite materials. Resistance factors for use in a load and resistance factor design format are developed for flexural buckling of doubly symmetric sections, both flexural buckling and flexural-torsional buckling of equal leg angles, and material failure. The developed resistance factors are a function of the coefficient of variation of the appropriate material properties. The proposed resistance factors were determined to provide a reliability index of 3.0 for buckling limit states and a reliability index of 3.5 for the material fracture limit state. A proposed method of developing an allowable stress design code is also given.

AB - A fragility analysis methodology is developed for assessing the response of light-frame wood construction exposed to stipulated extreme windstorms and earthquakes. Performance goals and limit states (structural and nonstructural) are identified from a review of the performance of residential construction during recent hurricanes and earthquakes in the United States. Advanced numerical modeling tools provide a computational platform for risk analysis of light-frame wood building structural systems. The analysis is demonstrated for selected common building configurations and construction (defined, e.g., by roof sheathing, truss spacing, and roof or shear wall nailing patterns). Limit state probabilities of structural systems for the performance levels identified above are developed as a function of 3-s gust wind speed (hurricanes) and spectral acceleration (earthquakes), leading to a relation between limit state probabilities and the hazard stipulated in ASCE Standard 7, “Minimum design loads for buildings and other structures.”

AB - This paper presents a series of tests on cold-formed steel plain (unstiffened) angle columns compressed between fixed ends. The test specimens were brake-pressed from high strength structural steel sheets. Tests were performed over a range of lengths such that column curves could be obtained. Geometric imperfections and material properties of the specimens were measured. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths calculated using the American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. The required additional moment as specified in the Specification and Standard was not included in calculating the design strengths for slender and nonslender angle sections. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the Specification and Standard are generally very conservative. Design equations for cold-formed steel plain angle columns are proposed, which are modified from the current design equations in the Specification and Standard. It is shown that the proposed design rules provide much more accurate results compared with the current design rules for both slender and nonslender fixed-ended angle sections. A reliability analysis was performed to assess the reliability of the current and proposed design rules.

AB - Comparisons of strengths determined from 150 physical tests of rectangular composite steel–concrete columns available in the published literature with the strengths calculated from selected computational procedures are conducted. The computational procedures compared in this study include ACI 318-02, American Institute of Steel Construction–load and resistance factor design, and Eurocode 4. The physical tests used for comparisons were conducted on composite columns in which steel shapes are encased in concrete. The columns were braced and pinned at both ends and subjected to short-term loads, producing pure axial force, axial force combined with symmetrical single-curvature bending, or pure bending. The study included only those columns for which the complete information required for analysis was available from the published physical test data and for which the compressive strength of normal-density concrete ranged from approximately 17–56 MPa (2,500-8,100psi). Major variables include the concrete strength, the end eccentricity ratio, the slenderness ratio, the structural steel index, and the transverse reinforcement (tie/hoop) volumetric ratio. The comparative study provides a critical review of the reliability of the computational methods examined. A recommendation for improving the ACI 318-02 procedure is also presented.

AB - This paper describes a series of compression tests performed on lipped channel section columns fabricated from cold-reduced high strength steel of thickness 0.42mm with nominal yield stress 550MPa. The test results presented in the paper are the third stage of an Australia Research Council research project entitled “Compression Stability of High Strength Steel Sections with Low Strain-Hardening” A range of lengths of lipped channels with intermediate stiffeners in the web and the flanges were tested between fixed ends to determine the strength of the sections. For the lipped channel sections, failure resulted from local and distortional buckling with interaction between these modes. The tests indicated that distortional buckling and the interaction of local and distortional buckling may have a significant effect on the strength of the sections formed from such thin high strength steel. The paper presents the results obtained experimentally and theoretically using the effective width method and the direct strength method, neither of which account for interaction of local and distortional buckling.

AB - This paper describes the computer modeling of axially restrained, one-way reinforced concrete slabs in fire conditions. The study was carried out for slabs with pin supports and slabs with rotationally restrained supports. A single span, 5 m slab, carrying a uniformly distributed load was analyzed using a special purpose, nonlinear finite element program, SAFIR. The study for pin-supported slabs considered the effects of the position of the thrust force at the supports and different axial restraint stiffnesses. The effects of axial restraint on slabs with rotationally restrained supports were also investigated. The analyses found that the behavior of pin-supported slabs is very sensitive to the position of the thrust force at the end supports and the axial restraint stiffnesses. Slabs with rotationally restrained supports are predicted to have much better fire resistance than equivalent pin-supported slabs due to moment redistribution. The behavior of rotationally restrained slabs in fire conditions is less sensitive to the different axial restraint stiffnesses than pin supported slabs.

AB - This paper presents a new flat shell element for composite and reinforced concrete (RC) floor slabs subject to extreme loading conditions, accounting for the effects of geometric as well as material nonlinearities. A novel feature of the proposed element is its treatment of problems associated with the geometric orthotropy of composite floor slabs, achieved through a modification of the conventional Reissner–Mindlin hypothesis. The new element is formulated in a local corotational framework, enabling the use of linear strain-displacement relationships, with the influence of geometric nonlinearity addressed through transformations between the local and global systems. In addition, a robust nonlinear material model is proposed for concrete which captures the salient response characteristics under extreme loading conditions, including the effects of elevated temperature due to fire. The proposed element is implemented within the nonlinear structural analysis program ADAPTIC, which is used in this paper to provide several verification examples, focusing principally on the significance of the assumptions made in the element formulation. Extensive verification against experiments on composite and RC floor slabs is undertaken in the companion paper, where favorable comparisons between the predictions of the proposed method and experimental results are generally achieved.

AB - This paper deals with the large displacement behavior of floor slab systems under extreme loading conditions. The analytical model, presented in the companion paper, is verified through comparisons against existing experimental results on both reinforced concrete and composite slabs, with flat or ribbed profiles. The new model incorporates a novel shell element and accounts for material and geometric nonlinearities under ambient as well as elevated temperatures. The verification studies examine the response of reinforced concrete slabs under unrestrained and restrained edge conditions. An assessment of the behavior of ribbed floor slabs is also undertaken, in addition to simulation of the structural response of a full-scale composite beam-slab floor system under a realistic compartment fire situation. The results show good correlation between the experimental findings and numerical predictions, and demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the proposed analytical model. Additionally, the studies and discussions presented in this investigation provide an insight into the key behavioral aspects of floor slabs under extreme conditions. In particular, the significance of compressive arching and tensile membrane actions, under various boundary conditions, is illustrated. Also, the importance of adopting a realistic representation of the composite slab geometry is highlighted. The proposed analytical model is of particular relevance to developments in performance-based structural fire design, where realistic assessment of the floor slab response is of paramount importance.

AB - A constitutive model devised for the analysis of concrete structures, and suitable for generic two- or three-dimensional applications, is presented and validated. For plain concrete a tension-compression distinguishing stress split is performed, and two scalar damage variables account for the degradation induced by the tensile and compressive stress components. As outcomes the model reproduces the stiffness recovery upon load reversal, and it captures the strength enhancement under multiaxial compression. Besides, the simple formulation as well as the extremely reduced number of parameters involved in the concrete model makes it quite suitable for the analysis of real structures, and constitutes a useful design tool. As regards to the nonlinear performance of the steel reinforcement, the explicit Giuffrè–Menegotto–Pinto model is adopted. Efficiency of the global model is illustrated via two seismic applications: one concerning an arch dam, and the other a six-floor reinforced concrete wall. The latter application is presented for validation purposes.

AB - This paper proposes an analytical approach to calculating failure surfaces in rectangular reinforced concrete cross sections with symmetrical reinforcement when submitted to axial loads and biaxial bending. The analytical method is valid for concrete with a strength of between 25 and 80MPa. The failure surface is obtained by means of reference generatrices that lie on two directrices corresponding to two known axial loads and on the maximum and minimum axial capacity of the section. The proposed expression was assessed with results obtained from experimental tests (from the literature) and from a numerical model. This approach enables the section capacity to be verified and the reinforcement designed to a sufficient degree of accuracy for everyday professional practice. The method is easy to use and may be extensively applied to reinforced concrete columns in buildings.

AB - A composite section is made up of a concrete slab attached to a steel girder by means of shear connectors. Under positive bending moment, part of the slab will act as the flange of the girder resisting the longitudinal compression. When the spacing between the girders becomes large, it is evident that simple beam theory does not strictly apply because the longitudinal compressive stress in the flange will vary with distance from the girder web, the flange being more highly stressed over the web than in the extremities. This phenomenon is termed “shear lag.” For design purposes, the effective flange width was introduced into national and international design specifications, whereby various effective flange width formulae were derived based on different analytical and experimental results. Accordingly, the effective flange width is generally less than unity, which is not realistic for a small girder spacing. In current effective flange width for mulae, the theoretical derivation is based primarily on a planar stress distribution reflecting shear lag at the central fiber of the concrete. However, this simplification ignores the fact that stresses vary through the thickness. This through-thickness variation needs to be taken into account to produce a more viable representation of effective flange width criteria. Hence, the need for a different definition of the effective flange width becomes apparent. This paper proposes a different method for defining the effective flange width for the composite section, which can be utilized with the results obtained from the finite-element analysis. A three dimensional finite-element model of the composite bridge is verified, and a numerical example illustrating the proposed effective flange width definition is provided.

AB - In the present work a seismic retrofitting technique is proposed for masonry infilled reinforced concrete frames based on the replacement of infill panels by K-bracing with vertical shear link. The performance of this technique is evaluated through experimental tests. A simplified numerical model for structural damage evaluation is also formulated according to the notions and principles of continuum damage mechanics. The proposed model is calibrated with the experimental results. The experimental results have shown an excellent energy dissipation capacity with the proposed technique. Likewise, the numerical predictions with the proposed model are in good agreement with experimental results.

AB - This paper documents an experimental testing program on the lateral in-plane behavior of pre-1950s existing and rehabilitated wood floor and roof diaphragms in unreinforced masonry buildings found in the Central and Eastern regions of the United States. Three diaphragm specimens were constructed with elements and connection details typical of pre-1950s construction. The specimens were tested, retrofitted, and retested again using different rehabilitation methods, including enhanced shear connectors and perimeter strapping, a steel truss attached to the bottom of the joists and connected to the vertical lateral force resisting system, and unblocked and blocked plywood overlays connected to the sheathing and joists. Specimens were tested under quasi-static reversed cyclic loading to evaluate their in-plane lateral deformation performance at selected locations of the diaphragm. The measured in-plane lateral response was used to develop backbone curves defining the relationship between the applied lateral force and the diaphragm midspan displacement. These backbone curves provide the basis for bilinear curves that define yield strength and displacement, effective stiffness, and post-yield stiffness. These parameters, based on experimental testing, were compared with the provisions for wood diaphragms in the FEMA guidelines for seismic rehabilitation of buildings (FEMA 273 and its update FEMA 356). For the diaphragms tested, FEMA 273 tended to overpredict the stiffness and significantly underpredict yield displacement and ultimate deformation levels, while FEMA 356 tended to underpredict stiffness and overpredict yield displacement. However, the updated FEMA 356 guidelines tend to conservatively estimate the diaphragm response in terms of strength, stiffness, and deformability.

AB - This paper summarizes the results of a comprehensive statistical study of inelastic displacement ratios that allow the estimation of maximum lateral inelastic displacement demands from maximum elastic displacement demands for structures built on soft soil sites. These ratios were computed for single-degree-of-freedom systems undergoing six levels of inelastic deformation when subjected to 116 earthquake ground motions recorded on bay-mud sites of the San Francisco Bay Area and on sites in the former lake-bed zone of Mexico City. These soft soil deposits are characterized by low shear wave velocities, high water contents, and high plasticity indices. The influence of period of vibration normalized by the predominant period of the ground motion, the level of inelastic deformation, earthquake magnitude, and epicentral distance are evaluated and discussed. Mean inelastic displacement ratios and their corresponding dispersion are presented. The effect of stiffness degradation on inelastic displacement ratios is also considered. For this purpose, mean ratios of maximum inelastic displacement demands of stiffness degrading systems to maximum inelastic displacement demands of nondegrading systems are presented. Finally, a simplified equation to estimate mean inelastic displacement ratios obtained through nonlinear regression analyses is provided to aid designers estimate inelastic displacement demands of structures built on soft soil sites.

AB -  Depending on the geometry of a thin-walled cylindrical structure, three different stability failure modes under wind loading can be observed. In low cylinders, the radial compression at the windward meridian causes a buckling mode similar to cylinders under constant radial compression while very long cylinders display a failure mode characterized by buckling in the lower third of the structure at the side which faces away from the wind. Both of these failure modes have received a certain amount of interest by the research community, and design rules and proposals against both these failure modes exist. The failure of medium-height cylinders is characterized by a number of horizontal ripplelike buckles in an area around the upper half of the windward meridian. Comparatively little attention has been paid to this failure mode in the existing literature. A case study using a finite element model of a cylinder displaying this particular failure mode will be presented in this paper. The governing parameters for this rather unexpected behavior are identified and an explanation for the structural response is given. It is shown that the critical bifurcation mode is strongly dependent on prebuckling deformations. An imperfection sensitivity analysis for various imperfection types is also presented.

AB - Structural motion induced aerodynamic forces on bridges are customarily characterized in terms of flutter derivatives. Considerable effort has been extended to refine the procedure to identify flutter derivatives of bridge decks using spring-suspended two-degree-of-freedom bridge deck section models in wind tunnels. In this context, techniques and implied approximations employed in the literature to identify flutter derivatives from section model studies are highlighted. Through a parametric study, this Technical Note assesses the efficacy of a customarily used identification procedure which provides an improved insight and better understanding of the identification technique for flutter derivatives.
