AB - This paper presents the results of a theoretical study of the postbuckling behavior of an axially loaded steel column at elevated temperatures whose thermal expansion is restrained by the adjacent structural members. This study investigates the effects on the column failure temperature by various factors, including the restraint stiffness during the column loading (expansion) and unloading (contraction) phases, column slenderness, and the initially applied column load ratio. The column failure temperature is defined as the temperature at which the load in the column during the postbuckling phase returns to its initial load. Results of this study indicate that the column failure temperature can be much higher than that of the column at first buckling and the higher the column slenderness, the larger the difference between temperatures of column failure and first buckling. Consequently, the column postbuckling behavior should be considered. Nevertheless, for columns with light restraints (restraint stiffness to column stiffness less than 5%) or high load ratios (load ratio higher than 0.5), the failure temperature of the column with realistic unloading stiffness of the restraint is only slightly affected by the postbuckling behavior.

AB - Steel concentrically braced frames are generally designed to resist lateral force by means of truss action. Design considerations for columns in these frames are therefore governed by the column axial force while column bending moment demands are generally ignored. However, if the columns cannot carry moments, then dynamic inelastic time-history analyses show that a soft-story mechanism is likely to occur causing large concentrated deformations in only one story. Such large concentrations of damage are not generally seen in real frames since columns are generally continuous and they possess some flexural stiffness and strength. This paper develops relationships for column stiffness and drift concentration within a frame based on pushover and dynamic analyses. It is shown that continuous seismic and gravity columns in a structure significantly decrease the possibility of large drift concentrations. An assessment method and example to determine the required column stiffness necessary to limit the concentration of story drift is provided.

AB - A procedure based on rigorous nonlinear analysis that estimates the deformation and force of an isolator due to strong ground motion is presented. The procedure offers an alternative to the iterative equivalent-linear methods used by current U.S. building codes. The governing equation is reduced to a form such that the median normalized deformation of the system due to an ensemble of ground motions with a given corner period Td is found to depend on only two parameters: the natural period, defined from the postyield stiffness, and the normalized strength, or strength normalized by peak ground velocity. The dispersion of normalized deformation for an ensemble of ground motions is shown to be small, implying that the median normalized deformation is a meaningful estimate of response. The simple trends shown by the median normalized deformation led to the development of suitable design equations for isolator deformation. These design equations reflect a 13% increase when the excitation includes two lateral components of ground motion instead of just one component. For comparison, deformations estimated by the equivalent-linear method are unconservative by up to 50% compared to those found from the more accurate nonlinear spectrum, and building codes include at most a 4.4% increase for a second component.

AB - The complete quadratic combination with three components (CQC3) formula is adapted for determining the critical response of elastic structures to two horizontal and the vertical seismic components with arbitrary spectra. The critical response, defined as the largest value of response for all possible incident angles of the two horizontal seismic components, can be estimated by the CQC3 rule assuming a period-independent value for the spectral ratio for these components. The CQC3 estimate is compared with the critical response that considers different spectra for each component, using spectra obtained from a preliminary study. The accuracy of the CQC3 estimate is evaluated for two values of the spectral ratio; γ¯1 is the average of the maximum and minimum value of the spectral ratio, and γ¯2 is the average of the two spectral ratios corresponding to the significant modes. Parametric analyses of one-story buildings and numerical analyses of multistory buildings indicate that the CQC3 rule predicts results within 5% of the critical value. For design purposes these differences are small and the CQC3 rule using γ¯1 or γ¯2 can be used to estimate the critical response of structures.

AB - This paper presents the results of an investigation into the behavior of I beams and deck profiles under concentrated loading in the beam’s transverse direction. The primary objective of the investigation was to provide information relevant to the current development of Eurocode 9 for aluminum structures. The rules in Eurocode 3 for steel beams were taken as a starting point for the study. A large number of numerical simulations were carried out using validated LS-DYNA finite element models in order to assess the accuracy of the given design model. The finite element models were validated against previously obtained experimental data for beams of AA6082-T6 extrusions from an experimental program designed to minimize experimental uncertainties. Modeling aspects for both geometry and material are discussed. The present study provides data for the effect of variations in yield stress, strain hardening, profile depth, web thickness, flange width, and thickness, as well as loading area, beam length, and beam overhang. The paper concludes with suggestions for improvement in the design models.

AB - This paper presents the results of static and dynamic tests on unreinforced brick masonry wall panels subject to out-of-plane loading. Fourteen wall panels were tested. The test program included static, free-vibration, and dynamic tests using harmonic support, impulse support, and earthquake support motion. The experimental results indicate that displacement, rather than inertia force amplitude, determines whether an unreinforced masonry wall will collapse during inertial (seismic) loading. An empirical force–displacement relationship is proposed that can be used for a substitute structure in a displacement-based method of analysis.

AB - Experimental and numerical studies are used to examine the behavior of friction pendulum (FP) bearings to multiple components of excitation. In the experimental studies, a scaled rigid-frame model representing a rigid bridge superstructure on four FP bearings is subjected to displacement-controlled orbits and earthquake simulations. Using the test data from bidirectional displacement orbits, the constant friction coefficient is calibrated for a rate-independent plasticity model for FP bearings. The earthquake test data are compared with numerical simulations to evaluate the efficacy of the calibrated models. The studies show that the coupling between the two orthogonal components is important for representing the behavior of FP bearings. Modeling of the vertical load on the bearings, and the consideration of this force variation on the bearing response is necessary for an accurate determination of the forces transmitted by the bearings into the substructure. Tridirectional testing of the rigid-block frame shows that the vertical ground motion component has a small effect on the response of a bridge isolated with FP bearings.

AB - Steel plates in double skin composite (DSC) panels are restrained by a concrete core and welded stud shear connectors at discrete positions. Local buckling of steel plates in DSC panels may occur in a unilateral mode between stud shear connectors when subjected to combined states of stresses. This paper studies the local and postlocal buckling strength of steel plates in DSC panels under biaxial compression and in-plane shear by using the finite element method. Critical local buckling interaction relationships are presented for steel plates with various boundary conditions that include the shear stiffness effects of stud shear connectors. A geometric and material nonlinear analysis is employed to investigate the postlocal buckling interaction strength of steel plates in biaxial compression and shear. The initial imperfections of steel plates, material yielding, and the nonlinear shear–slip behavior of stud shear connectors are considered in the nonlinear analysis. Design models for critical buckling and ultimate strength interactions are proposed for determining the maximum stud spacing and ultimate strength of steel plates in DSC panels.

AB - This paper presents an experimental study on the evolution of the neutral axis’s depth failure with the ductility at bending on high-strength concrete beams. Nineteen simply supported beams were tested and analyzed. Each beam was loaded by two symmetrical concentrated loads applied approximately at the span’s thirds. The concrete strength and the longitudinal tensile reinforcement ratio vary from beam to beam. As far as the ductility is concerned, ductility indexes were defined in order to characterize such property. The ductility’s influence on the value of the neutral axis’ depth at failure is analyzed and discussed. From the experimental program, the neutral axis’ depth at failure in high-strength concrete beams seams to be a valuable parameter to preview the beam ductility. Therefore, the practical rule of limiting the neutral axis’ depth of the critical sections presented by some codes of practice for normal strength concrete can be extended to high-strength concrete.

AB - The classic series of beam tests conducted by Bresler and Scordelis some 40 years ago to investigate the behavior of reinforced concrete in shear, is commonly regarded as a benchmark against which finite element analysis models can be calibrated. A nominally identical set of beams was recently tested at the University of Toronto. Aspects of behavior of the original and duplicate beams are compared and discussed, including load–deformation response, load capacity, and failure mode. Generally, it was found that most aspects of behavior were well replicated. Test observations reveal that the behavior of the beams is highly influenced by crushing of concrete beneath and adjacent to the loading plates. In the case of the beams containing no shear reinforcement, failure was influenced by the reinforcement anchorage plates. The disturbances around the loading plates and anchor plates introduce complex three-dimensional effects, making the modeling of these beams using two-dimensional finite element techniques difficult. However, accuracy is substantially improved if out-of-plane confinement effects are considered. In addition to some insights on the behavior of the original beams, and on factors that should be considered in their finite element modeling, the duplicate tests also provide information on postpeak behavior.

AB - The objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the effect of reference displacement on wall behavior under fully reversed cyclic loading using the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE) test protocol and (2) to assess damage accumulation for the imposed drift levels. Three walls were tested under monotonic loads to determine reference displacements. Four sets of tests, each consisting of two wall specimens, were conducted using the CUREE protocol with four different reference displacements. Results show that the reference displacement can influence wall strength by up to 15% while there was little or no effect on stiffness and area under the backbone curve. Three additional tests were conducted using a segmented version of the CUREE protocol to provide a way to correlate visible damage and stiffness degradation to imposed drifts. Results show that while visible damage was minimal at drifts as high as 1%, (8% of nails slightly damaged), a 52% reduction in secant stiffness had occurred.

AB - Coupled walls are known to be efficient lateral load resisting systems; however, the relationship between their global and local behavior is not well understood and has been shown to result in structural systems having excessive internal deformation or strength demands on their component substructures. In order to investigate appropriate parameters for identifying efficient coupled wall geometries, an initial parametric study of over 2000 coupled wall geometries is reported. These analyses permitted the evaluation of the sensitivity of the structural response to various geometric parameters. The objective of this study is to investigate the elastic response parameters of coupled wall structures and to identify parameters that will permit an accurate initial estimate of the global behavior of a coupled system, the local behavior of the coupling beams and the interaction between the global and local behaviors. Using elastic analysis and gross section properties, the role of representative geometric parameters in the response of coupled structures is illustrated. The effect of using various code-prescribed reduced section properties is also discussed. The critical role of the coupling beam design is also illustrated.

AB - This paper concerns the development of a numerical procedure for studying steel–concrete composite beams with regard to both the collapse analysis and long-term behavior at the serviceability limit state. The interaction among different parameters that affect the beam response, i.e., connection flexibility, rheological phenomena of concrete (creep and shrinkage), and nonlinear behavior of component materials (concrete cracking, nonlinear behavior of connection, yield of reinforcement, and yield of steel beam), is adequately considered by a uniaxial finite element model. The creep of concrete is taken into account using Maxwell’s generalized rheological model through a step-by-step time increment procedure. The nonlinear behavior of component materials is considered through a new nonlinear iterative procedure called the “modified secant stiffness method,” particularly effective for this type of problem. Some comparisons with experimental results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed formulation and its capability to predict the real structural behavior in both short-term tests under the collapse load and long-term tests under the service load.

AB - This paper presents results of finite element analysis of 18 strong-axis steel welded beam–column subassemblages with connection reinforcement. For the type of connection configuration considered, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends that the connection forces be obtained by locating the plastic hinge at one-third depth of beam away from the end of connection reinforcement region. Also a recent study pointed the location of plastic hinge to be at a distance of depth of beam from the column face. However, the present study shows that the plastic hinge is located at one-half depth of beam away from the end of connection reinforcement region. It is observed that the connection design forces obtained from the present study are higher as compared to those obtained using the FEMA recommendations. The paper also presents a noniterative procedure for the design of beam-to-column connections using a truss for obtaining connection forces, which uses this location of the plastic hinge.

AB - Ritz vector approach for evaluating the dynamic properties of electrical cabinets is based on the premise that a single significant cabinet mode is sufficient to calculate accurate incabinet spectra needed in the seismic qualification of electrical instruments mounted inside the cabinet. It uses mathematical functions to characterize the significant mode shapes that can be either a local mode shape of the structural member or a superposition of the global cabinet and the local mode shapes. The significant modes for typical cabinets have been identified from fixed-base finite element analyses. In this paper, modal data from in situ and shake table tests for two different cabinets is used to evaluate not only the validity of finite element analysis results but also the premise for developing Ritz vector approach. A key difference observed in the test data is related to the existence of a global rocking in cabinets that are anchored at the base. A rigid body rocking due to base plate uplift cannot be evaluated from fixed-base finite element models that were used in the development of the Ritz vector approach. Finite element analyses after modifications for incorporating cabinet rocking due to base plate uplifting give results that are close to the test data. Even though the test data and the new analyses show that the significant cabinet mode is different from what has been considered in the past, the basic premise for Ritz vector approach remains unchanged. Minor modifications needed in the Ritz vector approach for incorporating cabinet rocking superimposed with local mode shapes are also presented.

AB - The research presented in this paper was performed to evaluate and compare the influence of four types of secondary reinforcement for temperature and shrinkage on the strength and behavior of composite slabs with a variety of loading conditions and span configurations. The four types of secondary reinforcement were welded wire fabric (WWF), and three types of fibers. The tests included three-span composite slabs, with the steel deck continuous over the three spans but with no negative moment reinforcement used, subjected to a uniformly distributed load, and simple span slabs subjected to point and line loads. In conjunction with the slab tests, the flexural toughness and first-crack strength of the fiber-reinforced concrete mixes were determined using the ASTM C1018 standard test. The performance of the specimens reinforced with fibers is compared with that of the specimens reinforced with WWF. Test results indicate that the strength, failure mode, crack initiation, and propagation, and load–deflection behavior are not greatly influenced by the type of secondary reinforcement in the composite slab.
