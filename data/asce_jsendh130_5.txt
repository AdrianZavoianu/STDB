AB - Cold-formed steel deck profiles are extensively used in building construction due to their versatility and economy. Web crippling is one of the failure modes of these multiweb profiles. The provisions for web crippling contained in the 1996 AISI Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members are believed to be conservative for multiweb deck sections. They are based on unfastened specimens and are limited to the use of decks with certain geometric parameters. The unified web crippling equation of the 2001 North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members is also limited to certain geometric parameters. Although new web crippling coefficients for different load cases and different end conditions are contained in the specification, coefficients for the unfastened configuration in the end one flange loading case were used as a conservative solution for the fastened case because there are no test data available in the literature that are applicable to multiweb deck sections. Results of an experimental study on web crippling strength of deck profiles subjected to end one flange loading are presented in this paper. A total of 78 tests were conducted on multiweb deck sections. Test specimens lying inside and outside of certain geometric limitations given in the specification were tested with both unrestrained and restrained end conditions. Test specimens within the specification limitations exhibited conservative results in the prediction of web crippling strength using both the 1996 AISI specification and the 2001 North American Specification. Using the unified web crippling equation of the North American Specification, a nonlinear regression analysis was performed to improve the unfastened case coefficients and derive new fastened case coefficients. A calibration using these coefficients was carried out for both Canadian and U.S. specifications.

AB - The design of cold-formed steel (CFS) C-sections that have bearing stiffeners installed between their flanges is a challenging task because complex interactions occur between the stiffener and the C-section when the assembly is loaded to failure. These interactions make it impractical to derive design expressions from first principles. Described in this paper is the application of a finite element (FE) model of a stiffened CFS C-section that was used to carry out parametric studies of the behavior of the stiffened joist assembly. Based on the results of these FE studies and experimental work, design expressions are proposed for the web crippling capacity of a stiffened C-section; the magnitude of the forces that develop in the fasteners connecting the joist to the stiffener; and the equivalent stiffness of the fasteners. These design expressions are fundamental components in the development of practical design expressions for the ultimate strength of stiffened C-sections.

AB - Open web steel joists are prefabricated truss-type members economical for use in floor and roof support systems for  lightly loaded structures. Joists are designed in accordance with the specifications and standard load tables published by the Steel Joist  Institute. An experimental study was conducted to determine strength and general flexural behavior of open web steel joists having  L1 in.×1 in.×1/8 in. single angles with crimped ends for web members. Crimping the ends of the web members allows them to be aligned symmetrically with respect to the centerline of the joist, thereby eliminating the effects of eccentric loading in the web members. The purpose of the tests was to observe overall flexural behavior based on failure loads, deflections, and strains in the top and bottom chords. Outcomes from the study show that there is considerable rotational restraint in the web members at the panel points. Based on the parameters tested, an effective length factor is recommended that is less than that corresponding to a pin ended column. Finally, using the more accurate measure of rotational stiffness at the joints, revised service loads are recommended.

AB - Tests have been carried out on four full-scale composite connection specimens. The specimens were made by connecting two unsymmetrically loaded steel beams to concrete-filled rectangular hollow section tubular columns. The columns were hence subjected to axial loading and bending moments, and thus represented internal columns in multistory buildings. Columns and beam loads were increased proportionately up to failure, and both column and connection behavior were observed and recorded. The experimental failure loads and column behavior are compared against the predictions of a three-dimensional finite-element (FE) model, using a general purpose FE software.

AB - This study evaluates the feasibility of a new class of partially restrained connections using shape memory alloys. In the martensitic form, shape memory alloys (SMAs) have the ability to recover large residual deformations by heating the alloy above its transformation temperature. The proposed connection consists of four large diameter NiTi SMA bars connecting the beam flange to the column flange and serve as the primary moment transfer mechanism. Two full-scale connections were tested using the SAC loading protocol. The connections exhibited a high level of energy dissipation, large ductility capacity, and no strength degradation after being subjected to cycles up to 4% drift. Following the initial testing series, the tendons were heated to recover the residual beam tip displacement. After initiating the shape memory effect within the tendons, the connections were retested, displaying repeatable and stable hysteretic behavior. An additional test was performed under dynamic loading to examine the strain rate effects on the performance of the connection. The dynamic tests showed similar behavior, except for a decrease in energy dissipation capacity when compared to the quasi-static tests.

AB - A design procedure utilizing an ant colony optimization (ACO) technique is developed for discrete optimization of space trusses. The objective function considered is the total weight (or cost) of the structure subjected to material and performance constraints in the form of stress and deflection limits. The design of space trusses using discrete variables is transformed into a modified traveling salesman problem (TSP) where the network of the TSP reflects the structural topology and the length of the TSP tour is the weight of the structure. The resulting truss, mapped into a TSP, is minimized using an ACO algorithm. The ACO design procedure uses discrete design variables, an open format for prescribing constraints, a penalty function to enforce design constraints, and allows for multiple loading cases. A comparison is presented between the ACO truss design procedure and designs developed using a genetic algorithm and classical continuous optimization methods.

AB - A hypothesis, which is called similitude law of prefracture hysteresis, is advocated in this paper. The similitude law is as follows: the relationships anlong ductility amplitude μp, cumulative ductility ηp, and number of cycles Nf prior to fracture are represented by invariant functions for any type of steel member which can be fabricated from different materials, welding processes, and connections. Several invariant functions in accordance with the law were proposed, where the invariant functions show that the amounts of ηp and Nf are reduced with an increase of μp in plastic hystereses. The law was applied to four independent series of experiments done in the past, or series 1 (brittle fracture of box-section beams), series 2 (brittle and pseudobrittle fracture of rectangular solid bars), series 3 (pseudobrittle fracture of round bars), and series 4 (ductile fracture of H-section beams with welded connections), from which it was found that the invariant functions fit consistently for all of the experimental results. Since the similitude law allows us to calculate any combination of μp, ηp, and Nf from a single set of them, the law has significance for engineering application when we need to reduce the number of specimens from an economic standpoint without losing confidence. The similitude law is expected to be applied to earthquake resistant design which relies on plastic deformation of steel members.

The results of reversed cyclic-loading tests on three structural walls, containing hollow structural sections, structural steel channels and conventional concentrated reinforcement as boundary elements, were compared. With proper design and detailing, the walls with structural steel boundary elements performed as well as the companion wall containing vertical bars and closely spaced hoops.

AB - In this paper we investigate experimentally the dynamic interaction between components of electrical substation equipment interconnected by flexible (cable) conductors. Shake table tests were conducted on five different pairs of generic substation equipment specimens interconnected by three different flexible conductors with three different levels of slackness. No damage to any of the three flexible conductors was observed during any of the seismic tests conducted. Two different types of dynamic response were observed during the seismic tests. The first type involves low interaction between the interconnected equipment due to a large slack and/or low intensity ground motion. For this case, very different frequency contents among the relative displacement, absolute acceleration, and force response of each piece of equipment were observed. Also, large horizontal movement of the more flexible equipment was transferred almost entirely into vertical motion of the conductor with little transmission to the more rigid equipment. The second type of dynamic response involves high interaction between interconnected equipment due to a small slack and/or high intensity ground motion. For this case, large vertical acceleration pulses were observed at midspan of the conductor.

AB - Dry masonry mechanics received little attention from the research community when compared with resources invested in traditional (mortar joint) masonry. Nevertheless, a large number of historical stone constructions use dry masonry joints, while, in constructions originally built with weak lime mortar, mortar deterioration leads to a behavior similar to dry masonry. Therefore the objective of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge of the behavior of dry masonry joints under cyclic loading, which is a key aspect for seismic actions. The work focuses on the characterization of Coulomb failure criterion and the load-displacement behavior of dry masonry joints under cyclic loading, including aspects as surface roughness, dilatancy, and inelastic behavior. A displacement controlled test setup using masonry couplets is used for this purpose. Besides providing a basis for understanding the behavior of masonry joints in shear, the experiments contribute also to the definition and parametrization of advanced nonlinear numeric models.

AB - A series of five large scale clay brick masonry structural walls are subjected to in-plane simulated seismic forces. The walls utilize posttensioning steel to provide flexural strength. The primary objective of the research is to investigate five basic configurations of posttensioning to determine which has the most desirable characteristics for seismic performance. In the study, the variables of interest were (1) bonded versus unbonded posttensioning steel, (2) confined versus unconfined masonry, (3) grouted versus ungrouted masonry, and (4) application of supplemental mild steel for energy dissipation. Following the results of the tests, it was shown that the best performing configuration utilized unbonded posttensioning and confinement. By utilizing unbonded posttensioning, walls have little residual deformation after loading, thus yielding structures that would require very little repair, even after large seismic events. Such behavior comes with the price of reduced energy dissipation, however. Presented in the paper are the results of the tests as well as results of a simple analysis method for prediction of wall capacity.

AB - The dynamic response of a small-scale bridge model under a moving mass is investigated. The analysis is based on the continuous Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. By expanding the unknown structural response in a series of the beam eigenfunctions, the given problem is reduced to the solution of a set of second order linear differential equations with time varying coefficients. The analytical solution is validated through a series of experiments. A small-scale model is designed to satisfy both static and dynamic similitude with a selected prototype bridge structure, and a set of necessary similitude conditions for the given problem is provided. Attention is paid, in particular, to satisfaction of the mass similitude requirement, often constituting one of the main difficulties in the design of small-scale dynamic models. It is shown that experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions, thus validating the analytical procedure.

AB - Analysis of the frangibility of airport approach lighting towers using both full-scale impact tests and computer simulation were performed to develop a better understanding of the buckling and failure mode of the tower when struck by a representative aircraft. These data were necessary for the development of simplified requirements and test methods for the design of frangible structures that minimize the impact hazard to aircraft. This paper describes the model developed to simulate the impact properties of the tower using the LS-DYNA finite element analysis software. Three different velocities, 50, 80, and 140 km/h were used in combination with two different orientations of the tower to simulate impact at the apex and on the side of the triangular cross section tower. The results obtained using this simulation were compared to the experimental results from full-scale tests. In addition, the tower dynamic behavior was compared to the high-speed video imagery to confirm failure mode predictions.

However since this procedure came into use, studies carried out on fatigue and fracture mechanics has vastly improved our understanding of the behavior of such components under repeated loading. In this paper a method of design of steel welded components subjected to fatigue loading which takes into account this improved understanding of the behavior of components under repeated loading is proposed.

AB - The duration of ground motion has been shown to have a significant effect on the level of damage sustained by engineered structures during moderate to severe earthquakes. In this technical note, the authors present and apply an approach that makes use of the fundamental structural period, yield strength, and their regressive relationship with the number of reversed deformation cycles during a specified duration. This approach is applied in order to quantify the effect of earthquake duration on structural reliability using (1) a low-cycle damage limit state and (2) an ultimate strength limit state. The theory of order statistics was combined with an extreme value distribution model of the deformation response peaks in order to provide full coupling of the seismic hazard with the structural response. A Monte Carlo simulation framework was utilized to estimate the reliabilities of a suite of elastoplastic oscillators representative of structures having significantly varying heights, ductility, and yield strengths. The low-cycle damage limit state functions were written in terms of a special case of the Park-Ang damage model for elastoplastic oscillators and were expressed in terms of the oscillator characteristics and the four largest peaks of the deformation response. It was concluded based on the mean structural reliability indices for a suite of nonlinear systems that earthquake duration has a significant enough effect that it should be considered in seismic reliability analyses that focus on either low-cycle damage or on ultimate strength.
