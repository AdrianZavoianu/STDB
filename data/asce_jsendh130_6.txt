AB - This paper presents a case study on the seismic response of a recently constructed freeway overcrossing located in southern California, which is equipped with elastomeric bearings and fluid dampers at its end abutments. The analysis employs the substructure method and a reduced order stick model. The macroscopic constitutive laws of the springs and dashpots that approximate the mechanical behavior of approach embankments, pile foundations, center bent, abutments, elastomeric bearings, and fluid dampers are established in the companion paper. The paper presents an in-depth analysis of the seismic response of the bridge equipped with the response modification devices accounting for the effects of soil–structure interaction. The various response quantities presented are compared with the corresponding response quantities of a hypothetical bridge with integral abutments. Advantages and challenges in the two design configurations are identified and discussed.

AB - This paper revisits the mechanical characterization of the main substructure elements of highway overcrossings in an effort to build a more balanced methodology to compute the earthquake response of seismically protected bridges accounting for the effects of soil–structure interaction. Various macroscopic constitutive laws that are well known in literature are summarized and synthesized in a way that can be incorporated in reduced-order stick models used in practice. Here, we discuss the required sophistication level of the proposed macroscopic constitutive laws in order to capture the leading mechanical behavior of each substructural element without adding unnecessary complications when incorporated in a stick model idealization of the bridge.

AB - A bridge with lead-rubber seismic isolation bearings was field-tested to evaluate the assumptions and uncertainties in the design and construction. A numerical model was established based on satisfactory predictions of the dynamic characteristics under ambient vibration, free vibration tests, and the seismic performance under the 1022 Gia-Yi earthquake. Parametric studies of this model, under simulated near-fault ground motions, were carried out to investigate the near-fault effect. Two types of velocity pulse that characterize the near-fault effect were investigated. Results revealed amplified seismic response when the pulse period was close to the effective period. The response amplification by a longer period pulse was not consistent for the two pulse types. Additional observations included the ratio of dissipated energy by the lead-rubber bearings to the total input energy, which could be influenced by the near-fault effect. Variation of the near-fault effect due to a change of structural parameters was studied to provide information on possible mitigation strategy.

AB - A current focus in earthquake engineering research and practice is the development of seismic design procedures whose aim is to achieve a specified performance. To implement such procedures, engineers require methods to define damage in terms of engineering criteria. Previous experimental research on bridge columns has focused on component failure, with relatively little attention to other damage states. A research program was undertaken to assess the seismic performance of well-confined, circular-cross-section, reinforced concrete bridge columns at a range of damage states. The test variables included aspect ratio, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, spiral reinforcement ratio, axial load ratio, and the length of the well-confined region adjacent to the zone where plastic hinging is anticipated. The progression of damage was similar for all columns. Analysis of the experimental results suggest that key damage states of residual cracking, cover spalling, and core crushing can best be related to engineering parameters, such as longitudinal reinforcement tensile strain and concrete compressive strain, using cumulative probability curves.

AB - This paper reports on the results from a comprehensive component testing program on a type of buckling-restrained brace known as the Unbonded Brace™. The experimental data are used to: (1) verify the results of theoretical predictions on the structural stability of the braces; (2) validate the inelasitc capacity of the braces under severe earthquake demands; and (3) calibrate a macroscopic hysteretic model that is found to predict, with fidelity, the brace force–displacement behavior. The study concludes that the unbonded brace is a reliable and practical alternative to conventional framing systems to enhance the earthquake resistance of new and existing structures; capable of providing both the rigidity needed to satisfy structural drift limits, while delivering a substantial and repeatable energy absorption capability.

AB - This paper introduces the implementation of proposed rocking shear walls—as opposed to conventional fixed-based walls—in frame structures following the principles of the damage avoidance design philosophy. For improved seismic response, rocking walls are coupled with a separate nonload bearing nonlinear supplemental damping system. In view of the typical response of rocking systems, it is proposed that an energy dissipation system is configured and devices are strategically placed to exploit the expected large displacements. A performance-based design methodology is introduced and used to design a six-story rocking wall–frame building with various supplemental system configurations which include prestressed tendons and energy dissipation devices. Seismic performance and response evaluation, using nonlinear time–history analyses, suggests that desired performance levels (minor to no damage) can be achieved with added equivalent viscous damping (∼20%) resulting in reduced floor accelerations interstory drifts. Finally, a sensitivity study on the effect of various system parameters on the performance of the structure showed that the seismic response was not sensitive to the prestress level in tendons and to wall base width. Whereas a draped tendon profile results in a lower and more even distribution of interstory drifts in comparison to those in fixed-based structures.

AB - In an attempt to validate the effectiveness of a magnetorheological (MR) damper in controlling the wind-induced response of a building model in a wind tunnel, it is necessary to have a damper which produces a range of small forces so that it can be used to control the light-weight building model. In this study, a small-scale rotary type of MR damper is designed, manufactured, and tested. The damper uses shear-mode behavior of the MR fluids and is designed based on the simple Bingham viscoplastic model. A prototype damper that can produce forces in the order of a few newtons is made and tested in the laboratory. It is found that the Bouc-Wen model, which has been used to emulate linear valve-mode MR dampers, can also portray the hysteretic behavior of the shear-mode rotary damper. A simplified yet relatively accurate inverse dynamic model that can directly relate the damper force to the input voltage is proposed. Experiments demonstrate that a MR damper using this inverse model can closely reproduce prescribed forces. This inverse model provides an alternative means of commanding the MR damper for control applications.

AB - This paper explores how to characterize nonstationary wind speed that can be modeled as a deterministic time-varying mean wind speed component plus a stationary random process for the fluctuating wind speed component. The time-varying mean wind speed is naturally extracted from the nonstationary wind data using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The proposed approach is then applied to the wind data recorded by the anemometers installed in the Tsing Ma suspension Bridge during Typhoon Victor to find its time-varying mean wind speed, probability distribution of fluctuating wind speed, wind spectrum, turbulence intensity, and gust factor. The resulting wind characteristics are compared with those obtained by the traditional approach based on a stationary wind model. It is found that most of nonstationary wind data can be decomposed into a time-varying mean wind speed plus a well-behaved fluctuating wind speed admitted as a stationary random process with a Gaussian distribution. The time-varying mean wind speed identified by EMD at a designated intermittency frequency level is more natural than the traditional time-averaged mean wind speed over the certain time interval. The proposed approach can also be applied to stationary wind speed with the same output as obtained by the traditional approach. It is concluded that the proposed approach is more appropriate than the traditional approach for characterizing wind speed.

AB - A comprehensive finite element model is presented for the combined material and geometric nonlinear analysis of slender unreinforced masonry walls, with the capability of capturing postcracking and postbuckling behavior. Material tensile strength is taken into consideration; an exponential stress-strain relationship is adopted for the compressive region and its smooth linear extension is used for the tensile region. This model is applicable under different load combinations (concentrated and distributed lateral loads, vertical load with eccentricity, as well as self-weight) and different restraint conditions. Numerical results of the model show good agreement with experimental results, as well as with analytical results in published technical papers.

AB - This paper derives the maximum deformation demand placed on bolts in a single plate shear connection in response to rotation demands. The deformation demand is a function of connection neutral axis location. If the rotation demand is large enough to result in the beam bearing on the column, the neutral axis of the connection migrates to the point of bearing. Prior to bearing, the neutral axis will be located within the length of the connection plate. Forty-five data points obtained from three full-scale tests on T-type beam–column specimens connected with a single line of 19 mm (3/4 in.) diameter ASTM A325 bolts (threads included in the shear plane) and 108 mm (4.25 in.) wide 10 mm (3/8 in.) thick plates were used to determine the location of this neutral axis. Three-, four-, and six-bolt connections were tested through 0.06 radians of rotation. The mean location of the neutral axis was 0.63 times the length of the connection plate. The coefficient of variation was 5.9%. Only the six-bolt connection experienced a bolt shear limit state. The calculated ultimate displacement demands on the three A325 bolts that failed were 9.1, 8.9, and 7.9 mm (0.36, 0.35, and 0.31 in.). These values are consistent with the established maximum deformation value for fasteners, 8.6 mm (0.34 in.). Therefore, the equations presented in this paper provide an accurate estimate of the initial connection rotation capacity for single plate shear connections of common size.

AB - Although the use of internal ring stiffeners to enhance the strength of tubular joints is common practice in older platforms, no definitive guidance on the design of such joints is found in any of the major offshore design codes. This is the result of an acute lack of research in this area. In this paper, the findings of an analytical study on the strength of tubular T-joints with centrally located plain stiffeners under brace compression loading are presented. Data on the strength of 32 stiffened joints and their associated unstiffened joints were generated using a well-validated numerical model. It was found that the stiffening could accentuate chord bending failure and that strength prediction based on pure shear yield was grossly conservative. The influence of the various geometric parameters on stiffener strength was examined and the observed trends form the basis of an accurate predictive equation for the strength of the stiffeners, which was derived using regression analysis. A methodology for predicting the strength of stiffened joints based on the summation of the stiffener strength and the strength of the unstiffened joint is proposed.

AB - Composite action between a reinforced concrete deck and steel girders is usually achieved by making use of welded headed shear studs. The mechanics of shear studs embedded in mature concrete has been investigated extensively in the past. Current literature, however, lacks experimental evidence of steel–concrete interface behavior at early concrete ages. This information is useful in understanding the behavior of bridges during construction. Current testing methods are not suitable for determining the response of shear studs embedded in early-age concrete. In order to avoid this limitation, a new pushout test setup has been developed. A total of 24 pushout tests were performed at concrete ages ranging from 4 h to 28 days. Test results were used to develop load–slip curves and strength expressions. Furthermore, the variation of concrete properties with time and the applicability of the existing code equations for predicting early-age concrete stiffness were examined. Test results revealed that shear transfer is achieved at very early concrete ages and rate of stiffness gain of concrete is greater than that of strength.

AB - Concrete shells undoubtedly remain one of the genuine structural elements in contemporary architecture. However, designers have always been faced with difficulties in determining their shapes and, therefore, have developed analogies principally based upon physical models. In this paper, the authors propose a new form-finding method devoted to the numerical calculation of shell geometry and stress distribution. The mechanical approach requires isotropic stress tensors and is thus related to the surface stress density method already used for tensile fabric membranes. This process provides builders with an effective design tool and the possibility of generating various and suitable shapes in an interactive way. Several examples illustrate the efficiency and potential of the method.

AB - Structures should be optimal with respect to economic investment, benefits derived from their existence, expected consequences in case of failure, and the degree of protection to human life and limb. This paper presents the implications of a new optimization strategy for the seismic design of structures. A renewal model for the sequence of structural failures is used to define the objective function of optimizing the design of structures in seismic regions. The life quality index, which is a compound social indicator, is included in the optimization for efficiency of the measures to save human lives. This criterion balances quality-adjusted life years saved against the associated cost to society. The results show that safety standards used in current practice in earthquake engineering should be reviewed in light of optimization of resources and saving human lives. They also show the importance of different socioeconomic characteristics in the definition of risk acceptability.
