AB - A beam-column model for simulating the inelastic behavior of three-dimensional (3D) steel frames is presented. Yielding of the steel section is modeled by two nested stress-resultant surfaces and takes into consideration the softening effect of steel material at elevated temperature. Derivation of the inelastic stiffness of a 3D beam-column element is presented. Degradation of the strength of the material at elevated temperatures is formulated according to the “effective yield strength” concept. Application of the method is demonstrated by analyzing and studying the behavior of steel members and a 3D multistory frame exposed to fire.

AB - Since the September 11th terrorist attacks, the research and engineering communities have given significant attention to building performance under combined effects of impact, explosion, and fire. This paper presents a numerical approach for inelastic transient analysis of steel frame structures subjected to explosion loading followed by fire. The approach adopts the use of beam–column element and fiber element to enable a realistic modeling of the overall framework subjected to localized explosion and fire. Detailed requirements for modeling elasto–plastic materials subjected to elevated temperature and high-strain rates are presented. Verification examples are provided. The influence of blast loads on the fire resistance of a multistory steel frame is studied.

AB - This paper determines new section slenderness limits suitable for design and construction of seismic resisting structural systems. It describes an experimental investigation of the cyclic inelastic flexural behavior of cold-formed circular hollow section (CHS) beams. Controlled-rotation, symmetrical cyclic bending tests were performed on different sizes compact CHS with section slenderness D/t ranging from 13 to 39. With continuous cycling, the growth of ovalization caused a progressive reduction in the bending rigidity of the tube and eventually an instability occurred. The CHS beams exhibited stable hysteresis behavior up to local buckling and then showed considerable degradation in strength and ductility depending upon the D/t ratio. Seismic capacity parameters are presented, including strength, stiffness, hysteresis loops and modes of failure for each specimen. Peak moments obtained in the cyclic tests were compared with those obtained in monotonic tests published previously and also with design moments predicted using a number of steel specifications. The deformation ductility demand was determined and used to derive new fully ductile section slenderness limits suitable for seismic design. A comparison is made between these seismic slenderness limits and the static limits available in the design codes.

AB - In routine design of steel storage rack frames, it is far more common to perform two dimensional (2D) rather than three dimensional (3D) linear buckling analyses. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the global buckling behavior of high-rise steel storage rack frames may not be revealed by 2D buckling analyses as 3D interaction modes are involved. It is shown that the monosymmetric upright columns of a high-rise rack frame fail in a flexural–torsional mode due to the shear-center eccentricity of the sections, and that the 3D frame buckling analysis is more reliable in determining the critical members of a rack frame. Current steel storage rack design standards combine independent 2D flexural buckling analyses and simplified flexural–torsional buckling analysis of individual columns to account for 3D behavior. Comparisons between the buckling stresses of the rack columns determined from 3D buckling analyses and the buckling stresses determined in accordance with the steel storage racking standards are presented. It is concluded that the use of 2D analysis based procedures can lead to poorly proportioned pallet rack structures in terms of safety or economy. By comparing the buckling analysis results using 3D beam elements of varying degrees of refinement to each other, it is also demonstrated that the beam elements available in most commercial frame analysis programs are not sufficiently refined for accurate 3D buckling analyses of high-rise rack frames composed of monosymmetric thin-walled open sections.

AB - The paper presents the experimental and analytical modal analysis of a steel-girder arch bridge. The field test is carried out by ambient vibration testing under traffic and wind-induced excitations. Both the peak picking method in the frequency domain and the stochastic subspace identification method in the time domain are used for the output-only modal identification. A good agreement in identified frequencies has been found between the two methods. It is further demonstrated that the stochastic subspace identification method provides better mode shapes. The three-dimensional finite element models are constructed and an analytical modal analysis is then performed to generate natural frequencies and mode shapes in the three-orthogonal directions. The finite element models are validated to match the field natural frequencies and mode shapes. It is observed that the finite element Model-2 with the concrete slab provides the greater stiffness in the transverse direction of the bridge. The finite element Model-1 with the lumped masses agrees well with the field tests and can serve as a baseline model of the bridge.

AB - The wind-excited vibrations of structures induce fluctuating stresses that lead to fatigue damage accumulation and may determine structural failure without exceeding ultimate strength. This paper proposes a mathematical model aimed at deriving the histogram of the stress cycles, the accumulated damage, and the fatigue life of slender vertical structures exposed to simultaneous alongwind and crosswind vibrations. Wind climate is modeled by the joint density function of the mean wind velocity and direction. Wind-induced actions consist of aerodynamic forces on the stationary structure and of aeroelastic forces due to the structural motion. Aerodynamic actions on the stationary structure are caused by the turbulence of the oncoming flow, dealt with through quasisteady theory, and by the vortex wake, considered as independent from turbulence. Aeroelastic forces are aimed at reproducing the lock-in phenomenon. The static and the quasistatic parts of the structural response are evaluated by the influence function technique, taking all modes of vibrations into consideration. The resonant part of the response is related to the fundamental alongwind and crosswind modes only. The probabilistic accumulation of damage due to aerodynamic actions on stationary structures is estimated by a counting cycle method inspired by narrow band processes. The damage in lock-in conditions is superimposed by counting stress cycles deterministically. The examples illustrate the application and the effectiveness of the proposed procedure, focusing attention on the role of upper modes and wind directionality.

AB - The essential characteristics of an effective base isolation system are isolation, energy dissipation, and restoring mechanism. Some friction type base isolation systems proposed earlier have been found to be very effective in reducing the structural response and incorporate simple restoring mechanisms through gravity. However these isolators are effective only under certain excitation and structural characteristics. To overcome these limitations the authors have recently developed a new isolation system called the variable frequency pendulum isolator (VFPI) that has been found to be very effective under a variety of structure and excitation characteristics. In this paper, the mathematical formulation for the three dimensional behavior of an asymmetric structure isolated by a sliding type isolator, with particular reference to VFPI has been presented. The behavior of torsionally coupled structure isolated by VFPI has been examined. The factors affecting the torsional coupling of isolated structure have been identified. The behavior of structure isolated by VFPI has been compared with the structure isolated by other type of friction isolators such as friction pendulum system and pure-friction system.

AB - A statistical pattern classification method based on wavelet packet transform (WPT) is developed in this study for structural health monitoring. The core of this method is the WPT that has the ability of extracting minute abnormality from vibration signals. The vibration signals of a structure excited by a pulse load are first decomposed into wavelet packet components. Signal energies of these wavelet packet components are then calculated and sorted according to their magnitudes. Those components that are small in signal energy are discarded since they are easily contaminated by measurement noise. The remaining dominant component energies are defined as a novel condition index, the wavelet packet signature (WPS). Two damage indicators are then formulated to lump the discriminate information from the extracted WPS. Thresholds for damage alarming are established using the statistical properties and the one-sided confidence limit of the damage indicators from successive measurements. For demonstration, an experimental study on the health monitoring of a steel cantilever I beam is performed. Four damage cases, involving line cuts of different severities in the flanges at one cross section, are introduced. The vibration signals are obtained from an accelerometer installed at the free end of the beam. Results show that the health condition of the beam can be accurately monitored by the proposed method even when the signals are highly contaminated with noise. The proposed method does not require any prior knowledge of the structure being monitored and is very suitable for on-line continuous monitoring of structural health condition.

AB - Accumulation of research in the field of bridge evaluation based on structural reliability justifies the consideration of reliability index as the primary measure of safety for bridges. Furthermore, the lifetime bridge evaluation techniques are being mostly based on reliability methods. Currently, bridge safety is measured in terms of the rating factor, which reflects the live load capacity of the structure. In order to investigate the reliability index of an existing bridge and to consider its relation to the rating factor, an in-depth investigation of the interaction between these two safety measures for different limit states of different bridge types is desirable. This paper presents the results of a study in which the interaction between rating and reliability of a group of 14 bridges in an existing bridge network was investigated. This investigation is based on advanced methods to evaluate the reliability of each bridge in the network. Rating factors for different bridge groups are identified based on bridge type, and bridge groups are compared based on mean group rating factor. Bridge rating and reliability are quantified when each bridge starts its service life. The bridge rating factor and the reliability index are evaluated for various limit states belonging to different member types within the bridge network. A correlation study between bridge rating factor and reliability index of different bridge types in an existing network reveals interesting results.

AB - Restrained shrinkage has been identified as a major source of damage to buildings in The Netherlands. Several numerical studies have been performed and reported. Yet, successful experimental simulation and quantification have not yet been performed. In this paper, the successful design, setup, and execution of such an experiment are described. The specimen was a solid masonry wall of 2 m length, 1.3 m height, and 220 mm thickness, with a central opening of 420 mm×420 mm. An inverse approach to restrained shrinkage was followed by heating the constraining boundaries, in this case stiff, solid aluminum beams simulating rigidly connected upper and lower floors. To simulate upper wall and floor bearing weight, precompression was applied through six pairs of steel rods spanning between the aluminum beams. At a temperature difference of about 12°C a crack was initiated in the wall at the opening, which instantly and audibly propagated up and down over the full height of the wall. This was in good agreement with the predicted behavior, based on computational modeling with the recently developed finite element models for masonry, with parameters extracted from separate compression, shear, and tensile tests on small specimens of the same masonry.

AB - The external fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) flexural and shear strengthening of reinforced concrete beams is a well-established technique for structural rehabilitation and upgrade. In the present work, an analytical solution is developed for the load–deflection calculation of FRP strengthened simple beams at any load stage. The solution assumes a trilinear moment–curvature response characterized by the flexural crack initiation, steel yielding, and ultimate capacity. Closed form expressions are presented for the case of simple beams subjected to three-point bending, four-point bending, and uniform load. These expressions are derived for beams with any extent of uncracked, postcracked, and postyielded regions along their span. An extensive parametric study is conducted yielding unique linear relationships between basic sectional moments of inertia and their corresponding effective beam values for a wide range of geometric and material variables considered. Accordingly, a simplified analysis procedure is developed by adopting a trilinear load–deflection response. The effectiveness of the simplified procedure is demonstrated by comparing its results to those of the analytical solution and the experimental values.

AB - Lateral reinforcements can enhance serviceability of wood-based floor systems. However, because of a lack of proper analysis models, the benefit from installing these components has not been fully recognized in floor design. In this paper, a finite-element model for predicting static and dynamic characteristics of wood-based floor structures with various types of lateral reinforcements is presented. In this model, shell elements were employed to represent floor decking and ceiling, and beam elements were utilized to model joists and structural members in the lateral reinforcements. Special connector elements were developed to model the fasteners connecting various structural components. Other structural features, such as gaps perpendicular to joists in the subfloor, additional objects on floor and flexible supports, were also considered. A computer model incorporating these new features has been developed. For verification and validation purposes, the predicted deflections and natural frequencies for a number of full-size floors were compared with experimental values. Good agreement has been observed. These numerical test results indicated that the present finite-element model is reliable and unique, particularly in modeling floors with lateral reinforcements.

AB - The Australian Residential Timber-Framed Construction standard (AS1684:1999) has recently been revised to explicitly define the bracing contribution of nominally fixed plasterboard clad walls as 0.45 kN/m for cladding on one side and 0.75 kN/m for cladding on two sides. These values clarify the allowance, which designers may rely upon for the presence of plasterboard and their inclusion in the standard infers a necessity for plasterboard products to at least meet these requirements. A review of the relevant Australian, ISO, and ASTM standards, as well as plasterboard manufacturers’ in-house quality control tests has established that these tests mainly focus on serviceability aspect of plasterboard (e.g., storage, transportation, and installation) rather than that of structural bracing performance. It has also been determined that there are no direct correlations between serviceability conditions and structural bracing performance of plasterboard. In fact, a limited set of data provided by the plasterboard manufacturers shows that almost no correlation exists between the current quality control tests and the most commonly measured parameter, the density of plasterboard. It has been concluded that current tests are inadequate to serve as control measures for bracing performance of plasterboard. Nonetheless, it must be noted that density is not the only parameter that may influence the bracing performance of plasterboard; other parameters such as linerboard strength and bonding between gypsum and linerboard may also affect the bracing capacity. This paper details a new test, termed fastener bearing test, which provides a method to evaluate the bracing capacity of plasterboard. The results of this test show a very high correlation with shear connection tests. The proposed test is practical and simple to perform as part of the manufacturing process, in addition to the current tests, without severe cost and time penalty to the plasterboard manufacturers.
