AB - Cyclic behaviors of three types of laminated rubber bearings under multiaxial loading state are studied. First, the characteristics of the restoring forces of these bearings in small amplitude are investigated. The experimental results show that the equivalent stiffness of high damping rubber bearings is increased and the damping ratio is decreased as the increase of the amplitude. In addition, the restoring force of a lead rubber bearing is found to highly depend on the vertical load. Second, a triaxial loading experiment, in which two-directional displacement paths are given to the bearings under a constant vertical load, is conducted. The experimental results indicate that horizontal restoring forces possess the coupling effects. The equivalent stiffness and damping ratio of high damping rubber bearings and natural rubber bearings are increased due to this coupling effect in comparison with the biaxial loading case, while the lead rubber bearing shows a slight decrease in them. Hence it is understood that the effects of the triaxial loading are not negligible and these have to be considered in a rational and reliable design.

AB - Mathematical models of laminated rubber bearings under multiaxial loading are proposed on the basis of the experimental data in the accompanying paper. First, a one-dimensional model of the bearings is proposed. In this model, an elastoplastic model is extended by adding the displacement-dependent isotropic hardening rule and the parallel nonlinear elastic spring. Furthermore, the equivalent stiffness and damping ratio of the model are derived in the analytical forms, which are useful for the design. Second, the three-dimensional constitutive law is simplified by considering the biaxial simple shear deformation to derive the two-dimensional elastoplastic model. Then, this model is extended by a similar way as in the one-dimensional case to obtain the two-dimensional model of the bearings. The proposed models are shown to well reproduce the experimental results. Third, to confirm the ability of the proposed models to predict the seismic response, a triaxial hybrid seismic response experiment is conducted. In comparison with the experimental results, the simulations by the proposed model are found to accurately predict the response of the experiment.

AB - In this study, the measurement system for continua using the image processing technique is developed. At first, a correlation-based template that matches an Eulerian coordinate system is extended to trace the motion of material points in a Lagragian coordinate system and its accuracy is updated by including deformation of the template in the matching procedure. Then, a correction method for the measured deformation field is proposed. In this method, the measured deformation field is modified under a volumetric constraint condition in order to obtain a reasonable deformation field. To evaluate the accuracy and the applicability of the system developed, it is utilized in the experiments of tuned liquid dampers, laminated rubber bearings and cylindrical lead tensile specimens in order to measure the deformation field. The measurement results indicate that even when the object generates strain field larger than 100%, the system can capture its two- or three-dimensional behavior well, and the system is shown to be promising for rational and quantitative evaluation of these devices only using the experimental results.

AB - For efficient seismic computational analysis of reinforced concrete frame structures, a concentrated nonlinearity approach using interface elements is proposed. In the proposed model, the nonlinear response of frame structures is concentrated in hinge regions using interface elements. The interface elements as well as embedded reinforcement elements are assigned constitutive models based on concrete and steel stress–strain response. Two damage lengths, one for concrete (the hinge length) and one for steel (the bondslip length) as well as reduced initial stiffness are the additional parameters needed for the models. The remaining portions of the structure were modeled using elastic elements. Based on the simulation results, it is concluded that this model can generally be used for efficient reasonably accurate seismic analysis of a reinforced concrete frame structure.

AB - Even though a rigid floor diaphragm is a good assumption for seismic analysis of most buildings, several building configurations may exhibit significant flexibility in floor diaphragm. However, the issue of static seismic analysis of such buildings for torsional provisions of codes has not been addressed in the literature. Besides, the concept of center of rigidity needs to be formulated for buildings with flexible floor diaphragms. In this paper, the definition of center of rigidity for rigid floor diaphragm buildings has been extended to unsymmetrical buildings with flexible floors. A superposition-based analysis procedure is proposed to implement code-specified torsional provisions for buildings with flexible floor diaphragms. The procedure suggested considers amplification of static eccentricity as well as accidental eccentricity. The proposed approach is applicable to orthogonal as well as nonorthogonal unsymmetrical buildings and accounts for all possible definitions of center of rigidity.

AB - This study compares the seismic demands for vertically irregular and “regular” frames determined by rigorous nonlinear response history analysis (RHA), due to an ensemble of 20 ground motions. Forty-eight irregular frames, all 12-story high with strong columns and weak beams, were designed with three types of irregularities—stiffness, strength, and combined stiffness and strength—introduced in eight different locations along the height using two modification factors. The effects of vertical irregularity on the median values of story drifts and floor displacements are documented. Next, the median and dispersion values of the ratio of story drift demands determined by modal pushover analysis (MPA) and nonlinear RHA were computed to measure the bias and dispersion of MPA estimates leading to the following results: (1) the bias in the MPA procedure does not increase, i.e., its accuracy does not deteriorate, in spite of irregularity in stiffness, strength, or stiffness and strength provided the irregularity is in the middle or upper story, (2) the MPA procedure is less accurate relative to the regular frame in estimating the seismic demands of frames with strong or stiff-and-strong first story; soft, weak, or soft-and-weak lower half; stiff, strong, or stiff-and-strong lower half, (3) in spite of the larger bias in estimating drift demands for some of the stories in particular cases, the MPA procedure identifies stories with largest drift demands and estimates them to a sufficient degree of accuracy, detecting critical stories in such frames, and (4) the bias in the MPA procedure for frames with a soft, weak, or soft-and-weak first story is about the same as for the regular frame.

AB - Two methods for analysis and design of steel framing systems are outlined and compared to the current American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) load and resistance factor design (LRFD) buckling solution or effective length based procedure: an AISC LRFD based notional load approach and a modified elastic approach. Both methods provide a rational means of accounting for the key phenomena that affect system strength, specifically residual stresses (i.e., member inelasticity) and initial geometric imperfections. By accounting for these factors directly within a second-order elastic analysis, the need for effective length factors or buckling solutions is eliminated. Also, these methods provide a more accurate estimate of required internal system forces than current methods. Examples of solutions for a stability critical industrial-type frame are presented to illustrate the application of these methods, and to compare and contrast their results with solutions from both the current AISC LRFD procedures and from rigorous distributed plasticity analysis.

AB - Two methods for elastic analysis and design of steel framing systems, an American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) load and resistance factor design (LRFD) based notional load approach and a modified elastic approach, are outlined in Part I. These approaches capture the physical behavior of sway frames more faithfully than present AISC methods and eliminate the need to calculate column buckling loads or effective length factors. In this paper, the results from a comprehensive set of benchmark studies are summarized to establish the accuracy and validity of these two approaches for evaluation of the maximum strength of steel framing members and systems. Comparisons are made to results from rigorous distributed plasticity analyses.

AB - Static loading tests were conducted on 16 steel–concrete composite beams and two steel beams to investigate shear resisting mechanisms and the strength of composite beams. The main experimental parameters were the shear span aspect ratio of the simply supported beams, and the width and thickness of the concrete flanges. Based on strain measurements, stress in the steel beam was analyzed using theories of elasticity and plasticity, and the vertical shear that the steel beam resisted was calculated. The shear resistance of the concrete flange was then obtained by subtracting the steel shear contribution from the total load applied. It was found that the concrete flange could sustain 33–56% of the total ultimate shear applied to the composite beam specimens, contrary to the typical assumption of neglecting the concrete shear contribution in most design codes and specifications. A shear strength equation that considers the shear contributions of both the steel beam and the concrete flange is proposed.

AB - The evolution of the structural behavior in reinforced concrete beams subjected to reinforcement corrosion is studied here, by developing a suitable numerical procedure, which is validated by comparison with available test data. There are two objectives of this study: The understanding of the many aspects of the progressive damage in an existing structure (cracking and crushing, bar yielding, bond failure), and the assessment of the actual safety level. Nonlinear finite element analysis is used; the effects of corrosion are modeled by reducing the geometry of the finite elements representing separately the steel bars and the concrete, and by modifying the constitutive laws of the materials (steel and concrete) and of their interface (bond). Both the service and ultimate limit states are studied, showing the importance of the following phenomena: (1) Stiffness decay because of impaired tension stiffening, (2) crack pattern evolution accompanied by enhanced shear effects, (3) strength deterioration in bending and shear, (4) transition from tension to compression-triggered failures in critical sections, and (5) bond failure along the span and/or at beam ends. With reference to the last issue, the introduction of a specific model for bond deterioration appears to be of paramount importance in order to evaluate the residual ductility of a structure.

AB - Six specimens with different concrete cover (CC) thickness (10–30 mm) were tested to investigate the influence of the CC on the properties of reinforced concrete flexural members exposed to fire. The specimens were heated on their bottom and two lateral surfaces. From these test results, it is shown that the bottom CC has significant influence on the specimen ultimate loading capacity, but the extent of this influence will decrease with an increase in the CC thickness. Thus, it is improper to excessively increase the bottom CC thickness to improve the specimen fire resistance. The lateral CC has a less beneficial effect on the specimen fire resistance compared to the bottom CC. A concept of the equivalent CC thickness is proposed in this paper to better predict the effect of the CC on the flexural capacity of reinforced concrete members exposed to fire.

AB - The repeated loading responses of four shear-critical reinforced concrete wall specimens, with two different shear span-to-depth ratios, were studied. One series of specimens was reinforced using pairs of bundled stirrups, with 90° standard tie or stirrup hooks, through the wall thickness. Comparison specimens contained shear reinforcement made with larger diameter headed bars anchored with 50 mm diameter circular heads. A single headed bar had the same area as a pair of bundled stirrups and hence the two series were comparable. The test results indicate that specimens containing headed bar stirrups have a superior performance to companion specimens containing bundled standard stirrups, with improved ductility, larger energy adsorption, and enhanced postpeak load carrying capability. Due to splitting of the concrete cover and local crushing, the hooks of the standard stirrups opened, resulting in loss of anchorage. In contrast, the headed bar stirrups did not lose their anchorage and hence were able to develop strain hardening and also served to delay buckling of the flexural compression steel. Excellent load-deflection predictions were obtained by reducing the tension stiffening to account for repeated load effects.

AB - This paper presents a general strategy to select the numerical values of the coefficients defining an uniaxial tensioned concrete equivalent constitutive relationship to simulate, under serviceability conditions, the instantaneous and time-dependent flexural behavior of reinforced and prestressed concrete members. Such values are determined by a least-squares algorithm aiming to minimize the differences between the moment–curvature diagrams obtained with two fiber models: The first one uses the proposed stress–strain law and the second one follows suggestions from the Comité Euro-International du Béton. To obtain general conclusions, a numerical parametric analysis is performed on a number of reinforced and prestressed concrete rectangular and T beams undergoing bending moments and axial compressive forces. Closed-form solutions providing the sought values of the coefficients are given for reinforced concrete rectangular cross sections. These analyses yield a better understanding of the influence of the main considered parameters in the tension-stiffening effect. The proposed equivalent constitutive law is suitable to be incorporated into global models of concrete structures. Some examples on multistory plane frames are shown to highlight this capability. As well, various benchmark tests have been satisfactorily simulated.

AB - The pile-to-cap connection is a critical region in the structure that may experience inelastic behavior during severe earthquake ground motions. Although timber piles are extensively used in construction, little research has been devoted to studying the behavior of timber pile-to-cap connections under cyclic lateral loading, or to develop an improved understanding of the seismic design requirements of these connections. This paper presents an experimental investigation to assess the strength capability of timber pile-to-cap connections. The experimental study was conducted on full-scale timber specimens with different embedment lengths of the pile into the concrete beam. On the basis of the experiments, a theory to predict the lateral capacity of such connections was developed. The study highlighted the significance of wood compression perpendicular to the grain, wood hardness, and embedment length of pile into cap in evaluating the performance of such connections under lateral loads.

AB - In this paper, different methods of lateral force distribution and design are described and compared with the results of experiments on a full-scale woodframe test house, and with a detailed three-dimensional analysis using a Finite Element (FE) model. The primary motive for this analysis and investigation is to provide the basic understanding required for the development of improved design procedure(s) for light-frame wood buildings subjected to lateral loads. Improved procedures for lateral load distribution should be analytically correct in their philosophy, and offer reasonable trade-offs between the uncertainties and omissions in the design process and simplicity for the end-user. In this paper, eight methods are used to predict the distribution of design wind forces to the walls of an example L-shaped single-story woodframe house, in a moderate hurricane prone environment. The results are compared and the differences in the predictions between the various methods are highlighted. Four of these methods are further compared against the results of physical experiments conducted on a full-scale test house. The FE model was generally the most accurate in predicting the experimentally measured load distribution, followed by the “plate method” and the “rigid beam method” described herein.

AB - Timber rivets are fasteners for glued-laminated timber construction that were first sanctioned for use in the United Stated by adoption in the 1997 National Design Specification for Wood Construction (NDS). Rivet connections can exhibit a brittle failure when a volume of wood bounded by the perimeter of the rivets pulls out from the timber, or a ductile failure due to a combination of fastener yielding and localized wood crushing. The NDS approach to the former failure mode is so complex that closed form solution is not possible and designers must refer to limited tabular data, and the NDS approach to the latter failure mode is inconsistent with the approach used for other dowel fasteners. This paper describes an improved analysis based on the capacity of wood failure planes and the well-established dowel fastener yield model. Results of tests of large rivet connections highlighting the crossover from ductile to brittle failure modes verify the analysis. In addition, these results provide the first data for timber rivets in Southern Pine glued-laminated timber.
