AB - At the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the New York World Trade Center (WTC) Towers, extensive structural damage, including localized collapse, occurred at several floor levels directly impacted by the aircraft. Despite this massive localized damage, each structure remained standing for approximately 1 h or 1 h 30 min. Although the damage to the beams and columns in the perimeter tube of each tower were clarified in the published ASCE/FEMA report, the damage to the floor system and inner core columns were not estimated. The purpose of this study is to determine why the towers remained standing after impact through several analytical studies, including impact analyses using a simplified model to estimate the overall damage, a rigorous finite element model to estimate the local damage, and stress analyses after some structural members are lost. The results of the stress analyses show why both buildings did not collapse immediately after impact, and WTC2 collapsed sooner than WTC1.

AB - In current design practice for steel structures in fire, the temperature profile of a steel member will not change with its locations if it is subject to the same fire environment according to a certain standard or natural fire curves. This study shows that for the same steel member under the same fire curve, the temperature profile of the member will be different if it is erected in compartments of different sizes. The difference arises from the fact that the gases within the compartment transfer the heat energy to the steel member through radiation along different path lengths. While it is difficult to calculate the heat energy precisely for each gas molecule to travel along each path length, it is relatively easy to perform such calculations for the total volume of gases by means of an average path length, termed the mean beam length, in terms of the size of the compartment. The effect of the mean beam length is implicitly included in the formulation of the gas properties for heat transfer calculations.

AB - A simple formula is developed to estimate the separation distance required between single-story steel frames and firewalls so that during an uncontrolled fire the frame can expand without contacting and damaging the wall. Detailed analysis shows that the frames reach their maximum lateral displacement at the birth of plastic hinges in the girders. The hinges allow the girders to sag excessively, pulling inward on the columns and causing the frame to collapse away from firewalls. The simple method presented uses the frame geometry, member cross sections, loads, and the temperature-dependent steel properties to predict the steel temperature at which the plastic hinges form. The formula uses this temperature and the equilibrium of the deformed frame to calculate the minimum acceptable clearance. The fire is assumed stationary and fully developed. The exposed portions of the structure are assumed totally enveloped by the hot gas. The method includes the column resistance to thermal expansion and the plastic deformations that originate from the second-order effects due to the axial loads in columns acting on the deformed frame. The approach lends itself to spreadsheet calculations for fast design decisions and is accurate, which is demonstrated by good agreement with experimentally validated finite element results.

AB - One of the major safety requirements in the design of buildings is the provision of appropriate fire endurance of structural members. To assess and develop information on the fire endurance of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforced concrete structural members, a numerical model was applied to the analysis of FRP-reinforced concrete slabs. The computer program was validated against data obtained from fire endurance tests on concrete slabs reinforced with steel or FRP bars. Parametric studies were carried out to investigate the effect of a range of parameters on the fire performance of FRP-reinforced concrete slabs. Results of the parametric studies show that FRP-reinforced concrete slabs have lower fire resistance than slabs reinforced with conventional reinforcing steel when fire endurance is defined in terms of the critical temperature of the reinforcement. In this context the main factors that influence the fire resistance of FRP-reinforced concrete slabs are: the concrete cover thickness, type of reinforcement, and the type of aggregate in the concrete. A higher fire resistance for FRP-reinforced concrete slabs can be obtained through greater concrete cover thickness and through the use of carbonate aggregate concrete. Based on the parametric studies, a series of simple design charts is presented that can be used to evaluate the fire endurance of FRP-reinforced concrete slabs.

AB - In order to design reinforced concrete (RC) structures in earthquake regions, it is necessary to understand the behavior of RC panel elements subjected to reversed cyclic loading. This paper reports the testing of 12 reinforced concrete panels subjected to reversed cyclic shear stresses. The tests were carried out to evaluate the effects of two main variables: (1) the orientation of steel bars, and (2) the percentage of steel reinforcement. The test results showed that both variables have strong effects on the shear stiffness, the shape of the hysteresis loop, the shear ductility, and the energy dissipation capacity of a panel. Thus it is possible to design shear-dominant structures that are strong, stiff, and yet ductile by controlling the orientation of the steel bars and the percentage of steel in a panel.

AB - In order to design reinforced concrete (RC) structures in earthquake regions, a cyclic softened membrane model (CSMM) is presented to predict the load–deformation behavior of RC membrane elements subjected to reversed cyclic shear stresses. This model is an extension of the softened membrane model for monotonic shear behavior. Both models are rational because they satisfy Navier’s principles of mechanics of materials (stress equilibrium, strain compatibility, and constitutive laws of materials). Three new components of material laws were required in developing CSMM: the stress–strain relationships for concrete and steel in the unloading and reloading regions, the modifications of the envelope curve for compressive concrete, and the Hsu/Zhu ratios for cyclic loading. In order to verify the CSMM as a valid theoretical model, this study focused on comparing the predictions of CSMM with actual test results reported in the companion paper. We conclude from this comparison study that the CSMM can indeed predict the hysteretic loops and their pinched shapes, and that the “pinching effect” was the result of steel bar direction deviating from that of the principal stresses. The “pinching mechanism” and the “failure mechanism” are logically explained using Mohr’s circles of stresses and strains.

AB - The analysis of shear strength of longitudinally reinforced concrete beams, in which a constant shear force acts throughout the shear span, is performed. The shear mechanism is found to be governed by a second order differential equation linking the internal lever arm with the distance from the support. The solution of the shear governing equation is provided, and then the corresponding shear expression is parametrically defined by means of a mechanical analysis. The empirical parameters are determined from more than 900 test data and results found in the literature. The proposed shear strength formula predicts the experimental behavior in a more accurate and uniform way than most known expressions. It is also proposed a design formula, which is more consistent and reliable than the Eurocode one and even than the laborious procedures suggested by ACI Code and AASHTO Standards, since it exhibits a minor number of unsafe predictions.

AB - Coupled shear wall is one of the main structural elements in high-rise buildings. In this paper, a nonlinear macromodel is proposed to simulate the behavior of coupled shear walls. This model is composed of a multivertical-element model for wall piers and a combined model for coupling beams. In the model for wall piers, some key characters, such as shifting of neutral axis within the wall section, interaction among flexure, shear, and axial forces, can be taken into account. In the model for coupling beams, the deformation of flexure and shear, and the interface bond–slip action are considered by using different elements. Experiments of coupled shear wall specimens with different sizes of coupling beams are carried out to verify the proposed model. A comparison of the analysis with the test results shows that the model is an efficient one in nonlinear analysis of coupled shear walls.

AB - When designing a reinforced concrete column, most codes of practice specify that second order effects must be taken into account when the column slenderness exceeds a lower limit, usually associated to a certain loss of column carrying capacity. Such lower slenderness limits depend on the strength, stiffness, boundary conditions, and forces acting on the column. In this paper, simplified analytical expressions are presented for the lower slenderness limit of symmetrically reinforced rectangular columns. The limits, associated with a chosen (5 and 10%) loss of bearing capacity compared to nonslender columns, are derived based on general mechanics of concrete structures. The proposed formulae take into account the most important parameters governing the behavior of slender concrete columns, such as axial load, first order end eccentricities, ratio between permanent and total load, creep coefficient, amount and distribution of the reinforcement, and also different loading paths. Similar limits can readily be derived for section shapes other than the rectangular shape considered here. The results of the proposed formulae fit very well with those obtained by a nonlinear and time dependent analysis model previously developed and checked.

AB - In composite beam design, headed stud shear connectors are commonly used to transfer longitudinal shear forces across the steel–concrete interface. Present knowledge of the load–slip behavior and the shear capacity of the shear stud in composite beam are limited to data obtained from the experimental push-off tests. For this purpose, an effective numerical model using the finite element method to simulate the push-off test was proposed. The model has been validated against test results and compared with data given in the current Code of Practices, i.e., BS5950, EC4, and AISC. Parametric studies using this model were preformed to investigate variations in concrete strength and shear stud diameter. The finite element model provided a better understanding to the different modes of failure observed during experimental testing and hence shear capacity of headed shear studs in solid concrete slabs.

AB - A simplified design procedure as well as load transfer model for rib-reinforced seismic steel moment connections was proposed recently. As a followup study, an experimental program was implemented to verify the proposed procedure and to develop schemes that would prevent cracking at the rib tip. All the specimens designed following the proposed procedure exhibited satisfactory levels of connection plastic rotation. A combined strategy of rib reinforcement plus slight trimming of the beam flange in the form of a radius cut pushed the plastic hinging and local buckling of the beam away from the rib tip and effectively reduced the cracking propensity at the rib tip. The strut action of the rib and resulting reverse shear in the beam web were also identified through the strain gage readings in this experiment.

AB - One of the alternatives to enhance the strength of a tubular joint involves the application of doubler or collar plates as reinforcement. In order to gain understanding of the effect of plate reinforcement on the ultimate capacity, an experimental study has been conducted into the static behavior of axially loaded T-joints reinforced with a doubler plate or collar plate. The parameters investigated involve the type of loading (i.e., tension or compression), the configuration (unreinforced, collar plate reinforced, or doubler plate reinforced), the brace-to-chord diameter ratio 
β
, and the chord diameter-to-chord wall thickness ratio 

2γ

. The general test arrangement, specimen details, and most relevant results (failure mechanism and load-deformation relationships) are presented. The experiments reveal a significant strength enhancement for both types of reinforced T-joints in comparison with the ultimate capacity of the corresponding unreinforced joints. The results of follow-up finite element simulations on plate reinforced joints are reported in a companion publication.

AB - In the companion paper, the results of 12 tests on reinforced and unreinforced tubular T-joints subjected to axial brace loading were presented. The current study reports the finite element (FE) simulations of these 12 experiments. Various aspects of the FE strategy such as element type, mesh density, and contact algorithm are addressed. The numerically and experimentally determined load-ovalization plots reveal a very good correlation, not only for the initial stiffness, but also for the peak load and the postpeak branch of the curves. A comparison between deformed cross sections obtained from the tests and the corresponding numerically determined deformed shapes further confirms the close match between the numerical and experimental results. The paper then reports on the parametric FE study conducted on doubler plate reinforced T-joints subjected to axial brace compression. It is found that a significant strength enhancement can be achieved through proper proportioning of the doubler plate.

The experimental results show the possibility of cavitation in a new or existing crack opening mode. A theoretical dynamic water–crack interaction model is developed, considering the effect of cavitation phenomenon, to compute water pressure in cracks as a function of crack wall motion history, crack length, crack roughness, and crack mouth pressure. The validity of the developed method is verified by the test results and it is used to study the pressure variations in longer cracks likely to develop in the concrete gravity dams. The computed uplift pressures indicate that, in an opening seismic crack, water pressure develops near the crack mouth and there is no water pressure along the rest of crack. A simplified method is developed to estimate the dynamic uplift force and resultant position in crack opening mode to use in seismic dam stability evaluation using pseudostatic or pseudodynamic procedure.

AB - This paper presents the results of quasi-static bending tests on two different flexible conductors (cables) used to interconnect electrical substation equipment. The main objectives were to observe the flexural response of flexible conductors and to determine their moment–curvature relationships under axial tension. The results of the tests indicate that the force–displacement behavior of the conductors is linear-elastic with negligible hysteretic response. For most combinations of axial tension and lateral displacement, the flexural stiffness is very small, and tends toward the minimum possible flexural stiffness, corresponding to the situation where all the strands are slipping past each other, and are unable to transfer any shear force. Only for very large axial tension values does the flexural stiffness approach the maximum possible flexural stiffness, corresponding to the situation where all the strands are able to transfer longitudinal shear forces over one another, and the conductor section acts as a solid cross section.

AB - A statistical study is presented to evaluate the accuracy of five approximate methods that have been proposed in the past to estimate the maximum inelastic deformation demand on existing structures. Three are based on equivalent linearization in which the inelastic deformation is approximated by the maximum deformation of an equivalent linear elastic system having lower lateral stiffness and larger viscous damping with respect to the preyielding properties of the inelastic system. In the equivalent linear methods evaluated here the equivalent period and equivalent damping ratio are computed as a function of the maximum deformation through the displacement ductility ratio. The other two methods estimate the maximum inelastic deformation of a system by modifying its maximum elastic deformation through a displacement modification factor. Modification factors depend on the initial period of vibration and its lateral strength. A relatively large number of earthquake ground motions recorded on sites having average shear wave velocities higher than 

180
m∕s

 are used to calculate error statistics. For each method mean errors and standard errors, as well as probability of underestimating or overestimating inelastic deformations, are presented and discussed.

AB - This research project demonstrates how advanced composite materials can be used to strengthen existing timber bridge beams in order to increase the load capacity of the bridge. Many times, the timber bridges were not designed to withstand the heavy truck traffic that they are currently carrying, and are therefore replaced in favor of modern concrete or steel bridges. Current methods of strengthening timber bridges are not always practical or economical and so these bridges are simply replaced at a high cost to the public. This project investigated whether applying composites in the form of either a fabric wrap or laminate strips to timber beams would increase the load capacity of the beams. Bidirectional carbon fabric was the primary strengthening material used. A total of 10 solid-sawn Douglas Fir timber beams were taken from a timber stringer bridge in Yuma, Ariz. that was replaced in 1999. Seven of the 10 creosote-treated beams were reinforced with carbon fiber and then tested for bending strength, shear strength, and stiffness. Three of the beams were tested as unreinforced control specimens. The results show that applying carbon fabric to the timber beams provides significant increases in the bending and shear capacity, and nominal increases in the stiffness of the beams. Allowable stress modification factors are conceptually discussed that could potentially be used by engineers to determine the safe load-carrying capacity of beams reinforced with carbon fiber. However, a statistically significant number of timber beams strengthened with carbon fiber need to be tested to arrive at definitive stress modification factors.

AB - A nonlinear numerical model is developed to study the behavior of single- and double-bolted timber connections with relatively low member thickness-to-fastener diameter ratios. These structural joints tend to fail in a brittle fashion. Nonlinear geometry due to increased sliding contact between the bolt and the hole is modeled using the Lagrange multiplier algorithm. A plasticity-based constitutive compressive material model is developed to predict the nonlinear wood behavior in the contact zone(s). Numerical simulations of postelastic deformations of one- and two-bolt connections are compared to experimental results from tensile tests undertaken on double shear steel to glued-laminated-timber to steel connections. The established model is capable of tracing the inelastic deformations locally and globally and predicting unequal load fractions that are transferred by each bolt in two-bolt connections. Connection capacities estimated with the new elastoplastic model are bounded by classical elastic and fully plastic model predictions. Implementation of the new model is via finite element approximation representations.

AB - The effect of discrete distribution of transverse reinforcement for shear strength of reinforced concrete beams and columns is evaluated. In order to bridge the gap between the present code formulations based on the smeared distribution of transverse steel and the reality based on the discrete distribution, correction factors are proposed for rectangular and circular hoops and spirals. The correction factor for rectangular hoops is more significant than those for circular hoops and spirals. Poorly detailed members, where 

N&lt;4

 for rectangular hoops and 

N&lt;2.5

 for circular hoops and spirals, will have a capacity reduction factor that is less than the usual undercapacity 

(ϕ)

 factor of say 0.75, where 

N=number

 of spaces between reinforcement hoops crossing a shear crack. In order to limit the unconservativeness to less than 10%, 

N⩾10

 for rectangular hoops and 

N⩾5

 for circular hoops and spirals should be used.
