AB - One challenge in the application of control systems to civil engineering structures is appropriate integration of a control system into a structure to achieve effective performance. Placement of control devices is strongly linked to the performance of a control system, and the most appropriate device placement scheme is strongly dependent on the performance objectives of the control system. Additionally, for the most effective control system, the placement scheme should be integrated with the design of the controller rather than sequential. This paper proposes an integrated technique to place devices and design controllers based on the use of genetic algorithms. The approach is flexible, allowing the designer to base the placement scheme on performance goals and/or system requirements. Active control devices are used and an

 controller based on acceleration feedback is selected for this study based on previous successes with this approach in civil engineering systems. To illustrate the proposed methodology, two numerical examples are considered. The first example considers a 40-story shear building, and the second is a full-scale, irregular, nine-story building. Control is achieved through the placement of one or more active control devices placed on various floors in an active bracing configuration. The improvements in the effectiveness of the proposed methodology as compared to previously developed techniques are demonstrated through comparative studies.

AB - Extreme seismic vulnerability of bidirectionally eccentric structural systems such as street corner buildings has been demonstrated repeatedly during past severe earthquakes. Inelastic range response of such structural systems may vary considerably depending upon the sense of eccentricities regulated by relative quadrant wise position of center of stiffness with respect to center of mass particularly for reinforced concrete (RC) structures with strength and stiffness degrading behavior. Recognizing the same, an effort has been made in the present paper to analyze the inelastic range response of bidirectionally asymmetric structures designed as per the existing codal standards. Such response helps to perceive the adequacy of the code provisions to minimize the progressively damaging effects expected to arise in RC bidirectionally eccentric structural systems due to strength and stiffness degradation under severe seismic excitation. The effect of change in stiffness eccentricity due to cracking of reinforced concrete members is also attempted to be studied in the limited form. Inelastic seismic response of code-designed bidirectionally eccentric structural systems with only strength deteriorating and only stiffness degrading structural elements are also investigated to examine the potential of such comparatively simpler hysteresis models. Effort has also been made toward assessing the response of similar elastoplastic structural systems. The study clearly indicates the limitation of the design code provisions to take adequate care of seismic torsional vulnerability of bidirectionally eccentric structures made up of strength and stiffness degrading RC structural elements. However, the performance of the same seems satisfactory for elastoplastic structural systems.

AB - Floors made of precast concrete hollow-core slabs may be constructed without a structural concrete topping and with transverse tie reinforcement placed only out of the slabs. Longitudinal joints between adjacent precast units are filled with mortar on site. To ensure good diaphragm performance under seismic action, a special joint has been devised, in which the slab sides are profiled as continuous sinusoidal waved shear keys. The research involved experimental investigations and analytical modeling. The features of the joint and the means of production were first worked out. Then, a series of destructive tests were performed, on both short joint samples and full-scale floors, made of extruded prestressed hollow-core slabs without topping, all subjected to large in-plane loading reversals. They showed that, after the adhesion between the grout and precast concrete is overcome, a stable cyclic shear transfer mechanism develops, based on wedge action and friction raised at the wavy slab–mortar interface. The analytical studies led to a specific interface finite element, condensing the behavior of a segment of joint into two degrees of freedom. The model considers also the possibility of the joint being partially open, which may happen when the floor undergoes in-plane bending. This interface element, when implemented in a global model with “shell” finite element representing the slabs, allows for numerical tests on the ultimate behavior of floors of various configurations.

AB - A total of 23 tests were conducted to study the cyclic loading performance of links in steel eccentrically braced frames. The objectives of these tests were to reevaluate flange slenderness limits and overstrength factors for links. The effect of loading history on link performance was also investigated. Link specimens were constructed from five different wide-flange sections, all of ASTM A992 steel, with various lengths ranging from short shear yielding links to very long flexural yielding links. In addition to providing data on the effects of flange buckling and overstrength, these tests also showed some unexpected failure modes. The paper provides an overview of this experimental investigation, describing the overall research program, as well as details of the test specimens and test results. The paper concludes with a number of design recommendations for links in eccentrically braced frames.

AB - Ambient vibration measurement is an important tool to evaluate the integrity of in-service structures. The writers apply a new structural identification method to ambient vibration data taken from a full-scale suspension bridge. The method consists of two steps: identification of vibration modes and inverse analysis of structural properties from the identified modes. For modal identification, the method treats the structure as a multi-input–multioutput system, distinguishing noise from true modes and employing ambient vibration measurement. For the identification of structural properties, assumptions on proportionality of damping, previous estimation of structural damping/stiffness, and numerical iteration are not required. Application to the Hakucho Bridge in Hokkaido, Japan, verifies that the method can precisely determine the characteristics of not only the lower modes, but also the higher modes, and can effectively detect changes in the structural properties.

AB - An analytical study was conducted to investigate the influence of the flange width–thickness ratio on the rotation capacity of links in eccentrically braced frames. Finite element models, verified using experimental data, were used to investigate the performance of 112 links. Models simulated strength degradation associated with flange and web local buckling that may occur during cyclic loading. The models provided data for short, intermediate, and long links with a range of flange width–thickness ratios. Results indicate that a relaxation of the flange width–thickness ratio requirement in current AISC seismic design provisions is justified. It was also found, however, that the provisions specify nonconservative design rotations for some intermediate links. This is shown to be related to web stiffener spacing and not the flange width–thickness ratio.

AB - The paper addresses the design of angle section columns whose legs are slender and thus subject to local buckling in their ultimate limit state. For such slender angle sections, the local buckling mode is identical to the torsional mode and traditional design procedures become excessively conservative because they account for the torsional (local) buckling mode twice. The paper describes design methods for slender equal-leg angles which ignore torsion in determining the overall buckling stress and use recently presented effective width equations to accurately determine the bending capacity of angle sections, as required in the beam–column design approach. The shift in the effective centroid resulting from local buckling is determined from the actual stress distribution, as obtained using Stowell’s classical solution, rather than the effective cross section. The columns are assumed to be simply supported and thus allowed to rotate about their principal axes.

AB - G450 steel to AS 1397 is a cold-reduced sheet steel with in-line galvanizing. Its grade is 

450
MPa

 yield and 

480
MPa

 tensile strength. It is widely used in Australia for purlins, and is being used to fabricate lightweight portal frames, often by welding. The effects of welding on G450 sheet steel in the heat affected zone with respect to the connection strength were unknown. In the present work, transverse and longitudinal fillet, and flare-bevel welded connections in 1.5 and 

3.0
mm

 G450 steel were tested to failure. The test results are used to check the relevant design rules in the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structures AS/NZS 4600. It was found that the current design rules are not adequate for certain connection configurations in G450 steel to achieve the target safety index of 3.5. Reduced resistance (capacity) factors are proposed for some connections. It was also found that the current design rule for longitudinal flare-bevel welded connections is unnecessarily conservative. The quality of welded connections in thin sheet steels produced by industry fabricators was investigated. The need to complement the macrotest with the destructive prying test as part of the prequalification procedure for such connections is demonstrated. Part of the results of the present work has recently been incorporated into the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members with a lowering of the thickness to 

2.5
mm

 above which weld throat failure should be checked.

AB - This paper describes the buckling behavior of cold-formed steel equally lipped angle columns. The initial local imperfections, residual stresses, and corner material properties of the cold-formed steel angles have been measured experimentally and reported in this paper. An accurate finite element model was developed to carry out the buckling analysis. Both initial local and overall geometric imperfections have been incorporated in the model. The effect of residual stresses on the buckling behavior was investigated. The material nonlinearities of flat and corner portions of the angle sections were considered in the analysis. The finite element analysis was performed on equally lipped angles compressed between fixed ends for different column lengths, and column curves were obtained. The nonlinear finite element model was verified against recent experimental results. An extensive parametric study was carried out using the finite element model to study the effects of cross section geometries on the strength and behavior of lipped angle columns. The column strengths predicted by the finite element model were compared with the design strengths calculated using the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. In addition, the results obtained from the finite element model were also compared with the design strengths obtained from proposed design rules. It is shown that the proposed design rules accurately predicted the column strengths for non-slender lipped angles and were quite conservative for slender lipped angles.

AB - The bending behavior of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with composite materials externally bonded using nonlinear and inelastic adhesives is analytically investigated. A mathematical nonlinear model that uses the concepts of the high order theory and incorporates nonlinear and inelastic shear stress–shear angle behavior of the adhesive material is derived. The model is derived via the principle of virtual work along with the compatibility conditions, the constitutive laws, and the closed form solutions of the stress and displacement fields of the adhesive. The nonlinear governing differential equations are solved numerically for the case of elastic nonlinear adhesives and via an iterative procedure for cases that involve elastic–perfectly plastic adhesives. The unloading/reloading aspects of the inelastic structure are also considered. A numerical study of two beams strengthened with composite strips bonded using linear-elastic, nonlinear-elastic, and elasto-plastic adhesives is presented, discussed, and compared to finite element analysis. The results imply that the use of such adhesive materials improves the overall load carrying behavior of the strengthened beam, increases its ductility, provides the mechanism for the formation of plastic hinges, and reduces the shear stresses near the ends of the bonded strip.

AB - Despite experimental evidences, the contributions of the concrete slab and composite action to the vertical shear strength of simply supported steel–concrete composite beams are not considered in current design codes, which lead to conservative designs. In this paper, the finite element method is used to investigate the flexural and shear strengths of simply supported composite beams under combined bending and shear. A three-dimensional finite element model has been developed to account for geometric and material nonlinear behavior of composite beams, and verified by experimental results. The verified finite element model is than employed to quantify the contributions of the concrete slab and composite action to the moment and shear capacities of composite beams. The effect of the degree of shear connection on the vertical shear strength of deep composite beams loaded in shear is studied. Design models for vertical shear strength including contributions from the concrete slab and composite action and for the ultimate moment–shear interaction are proposed for the design of simply supported composite beams in combined bending and shear. The proposed design models provide a consistent and economical design procedure for simply supported composite beams.

AB - The structural assessment of large traditional and historical masonry buildings poses significant challenges due to the need for modeling complex geometries and nonlinear material behavior. Although sophisticated methods have been developed for the nonlinear analysis of such structural systems—mostly based on two- or three-dimensional finite element modeling—they can hardly be used for practical purposes due to very large computational requirements. This paper presents an alternate method, specifically developed for efficiently simulating the service and ultimate responses of structural systems composed of masonry load-bearing walls. Its efficiency stems from the technique adopted to model the wall panels, based on treating them as equivalent frame systems composed of one-dimensional elements. In addition, biaxial constitutive equations are included to account for the relevant aspects of the nonlinear response of the material. In spite of the numerical efficiency of the method, it is able to obtain accurate predictions of the overall response of masonry buildings and their failure condition. The method has been successfully used for the analysis of actual historical large constructions and for simulating possible operations of repair and restoration.

AB - An optimal protocol for stress range/number of cycles 

(S∕N)

 life testing is developed. The objective is to obtain an 

S∕N

 curve that will minimize the error in predictions of the service life, taking into account the fact that there is always uncertainty about an 

S∕N

 curve derived from limited testing. The mathematical results apply to any problem in which there is uncertainty not only about the properties of the specimen, but also about the stress ranges that will be applied under service loads. It is shown that finding the testing procedure that will truly minimize the mean-squared error requires the solution of a quartic equation, but good approximate results can be obtained from the roots of a quadratic equation. Furthermore, it is easy to determine the consequences of using a nonoptimal testing procedure. The results are illustrated by their application to simple and commonly used models for fatigue prediction. Some numerical integration is required when the method is applied for most distributions of service stress ranges, but this is not true for the log-normal distribution and graphical results are presented which allow direct application for the popular Weibull model.

AB - This research study investigates the practicality of using a Slepian model to model the earthquake excitation and structural response behavior of structures during the strong ground motion portion and entire duration of earthquake acceleration records. Of particular interest was the extreme response behavior of basic linear and nonlinear hysteretic oscillators. Predictions for the linear oscillators were found to be good, while predictions for the highly nonlinear oscillators were poorer until corrected for the change in equilibrium position experienced during the motion response behavior. Based upon the experience gained from these examples, a three-story frame whose beam-to-column connections were modeled as trilinear hysteretic systems were investigated. The accuracy of the Slepian response prediction for the seismic response was confirmed and the expected value form was coupled with a drift-based limit state function to estimate a conditional form of the first order structural reliability. Since the coefficient of variation of the seismic demand is not explicitly known, the reliability estimates were bounded based upon observations of typical seismic demand variation in engineered structural systems.

AB - Experimental work was conducted on oriented strand board webbed wood I-joists to investigate the buckling behavior. Both lateral buckling and local web buckling were witnessed in the tests. The two types of buckling were reproduced in the finite element simulations using ABAQUS. The buckling modes and usually overestimated buckling loads of a joist were obtained from linear eigenvalue buckling analysis. The buckling modes were then introduced into a joist as initial geometric imperfections to conduct nonlinear buckling analysis, and more reliable buckling loads were obtained. Based on statistics of the analytical results, the local web buckling capacity at a support was empirically expressed by the postbuckling load. The empirical formula was extended to local web buckling under a concentrated load applied to the upper flange, where a reduction in buckling load was made to take the effect of moment into account.

AB - A method is presented for determining snow drifts at roof steps in series. The method is based upon provisions in the current ASCE 7 load standard for snow drifts at a single roof step. It yields a reasonably conservative estimate for the drift at a downwind leeward or windward step.
