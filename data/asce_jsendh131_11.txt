AB - The work described herein was conducted within the framework of an ongoing research program on the dynamic behavior of the Tower of Matilde, the bell tower of the Cathedral of San Miniato, Pisa, Italy, an interesting case study for its current structural arrangement and the modifications it has undergone over the centuries. This paper (Part I) details the experimental analyses performed in order to obtain an accurate measure of both the motion of the tower’s bells and, consequently, the time function of the dynamic actions transmitted to the tower during their motion. We then demonstrate how it is possible to arrive at an accurate, even though approximate, analytical description of both the bells’ motion and their actions by means of only a few experimental measurements and a simple mechanical model (also called in the following additional mass model).

AB - The work described herein was conducted within the framework of an ongoing research program on the dynamic behavior of the Tower of Matilde, the bell tower of the Cathedral of San Miniato, Pisa, Italy, an interesting case study for its current structural arrangement and the modifications it has undergone over the centuries. This is Part 2 of a more extensive publication dealing with the results of such research and presents the experimental measurements and analyses conducted in order to determine the motion of the tower subjected to the actions produced by the motion of the two largest of its six bells. The numerical and analytical models adopted to interpret the experimental results, from the most elaborate and complex to the simplest ones, have all confirmed that the third harmonic frequency of oscillation of the largest bell is very close to the first eigenfrequency of the bell tower structure. Such studies moreover have enabled making a first approximation of the values of the global mechanical parameters characterizing the tower’s dynamic behavior.

AB - The paper presents the results of experimental research on the structural behavior of dry joint masonry. The most relevant experimental results concern the strength response of stone dry joint masonry walls subjected to in-plane combined compressive and shear loading. Significant features of the structural behavior shown by the walls are discussed and conclusions on their ultimate capacity and observed failure mechanisms are addressed. Complementarily, the application of an existing numerical model, stemming from plasticity and based on a micromodeling strategy, is also presented and discussed with regard to its capacity to simulate the obtained experimental results. The model was calibrated with data collected from complementary tests carried out on specimens and prisms made of the same type of stone. Finally, the usage of a simplified method of analysis based on a continuum of diagonal struts is also addressed.

AB - Corrosion induced structural failures do not necessarily imply structural collapse but in most cases are manifested by loss of structural serviceability, characterized by concrete cracking and the excessive deflection. This paper attempts to develop a performance-based methodology for serviceability assessment of corrosion affected concrete structures. Methods of time-dependent reliability are employed to quantify the probability of serviceability failure. A merit of the developed methodology is that the structural response is directly related to design criteria used by structural engineers and asset managers. It is found in the paper that, under the same service conditions, corrosion induced cracking attains a serviceability limit state before deflection does. It is concluded that a time-dependent reliability method can serve as a tool for structural engineers and asset managers to develop a risk-informed and cost-effective strategy in the management of corrosion-affected concrete structures.

AB - Corrosion-induced cracking is observed to vary spatially over concrete surfaces. A two-dimensional spatial time-dependent reliability model is developed to predict the likelihood and extent of corrosion-induced cracking. The spatial variability of concrete cover, concrete compressive strength, and surface chloride concentration are considered in the spatial time-dependent reliability model. The reliability analysis predicts: (1) probability of the first incidence of cracking, (2) proportion of an area subject to severe cracking, and (3) probability that a given percentage of a concrete surface has cracked. Corrosion-induced crack initiation and propagation models are developed for limit crack widths up to 1 mm. The present paper presents results for a typical reinforced concrete bridge deck. The effect of concrete cover, concrete quality, limit crack width, and environment are considered. It was shown that for poor durability design specifications the likelihood and extent of spalling is high. When combined with a life-cycle cost analysis, this predictive capability enables the extent of future repair costs to be estimated and the optimal durability design specifications or repair/maintenance strategies determined.

AB - A model for fiber reinforced composites that takes into account the fiber slipping is presented in this paper and applied to the analysis of reinforced concrete elements. The model is formulated within the framework of the plasticity theory and the mixtures theory, considering two phases corresponding to the matrix (concrete) and the fibers (reinforcing bars) and modifying the behavior of the last to take into account the relative displacement between the two phases. An elasto-plastic interface model developed by other writers is used to describe the bond–slip mechanism. The resulting model is attractive for the analysis of reinforced concrete problems at the macrostructural level since the explicit discretization of reinforcing bars and interface is not required, with the consequent computational cost reduction. The paper concludes with application examples and comparisons with experimental results of reinforced concrete elements that show the capacity of the model developed.

AB - This paper presents an experimental work and prediction of bond capacities of longitudinal steel rebar for concrete element with the polyacetal fiber (PAF) including internal reinforcements and externally wrapped sheets for confinement, where the bond capacity means an average bond resistance over a length of embedment of the rebar. The objectives of this study are to clarify bond behavior and to evaluate the bond strength. The loading tests were performed on 22 cantilever type specimens that vary on the amount and the location in a cross section, such as stirrup (peripheral around rebars), subtie, and jacketing. The test results indicated that the maximum bond capacity could improve with PAF as internal and external reinforcements consist of filaments and sheets, respectively. Considering strain behavior of transverse reinforcements, the writers proposed a new predictable equation for internal reinforcements. On the other hand, a predictable equation for the PAF sheets was also derived from the efficiency coefficient of PAF sheets on shear capacity of the RC element, which was already proposed. Both the bond strengths of average and each rebar were predicted by respective proposed equations. The close approximations were obtained to experimental data for internal and external fiber reinforcements.

AB - An infill system for frame structures has been developed as a retrofit strategy for critical facilities. The system uses precast panels made with an engineered cementitious composite (ECC) material in lieu of a traditional reinforced concrete or masonry. The ECC material is advantageous due to the increased tensile strain capacity and compressive toughness of the material relative to traditional materials. Finite element simulations were performed to identify promising infill geometries. A series of structural scale tests was developed from the simulation results. The results from a series of single panel tests are presented. Testing results indicated that different levels of panel strength and stiffness can be achieved by varying the mix design of the ECC material and the amount of reinforcement in the panels. The panel test results combined with the simulation results demonstrate the potential of the infill system as a retrofit.

AB - This paper presents a numerical formulation for the nonlinear analysis of slender steel-concrete composite columns of generic cross-sectional shape, subjected to axial force and biaxial bending. The cross section is defined in terms of a number of closed polygonal loops of a specific material, each one with its own stress-strain relation, with reinforcement bars embedded in the polygons. The material and geometrically nonlinear equlibrium problem is solved by the finite element method, with displacement-based stress resultant beam-column elements. The proposed scheme turns possible, with a unified treatment, to perform analyses of concrete-filled steel tubes, fully or partially encased steel profiles, or less usual cross sections present on composite construction. The robustness and accuracy of the formulation is verified against numerical and experimental results available in the literature.

AB - This paper is concerned with the elastic flexural–torsional buckling of concentrically loaded columns with oblique eccentric restraints. Oblique flexural restraints may resist deflections as well as flexural rotations, while torsional restraints may resist twist rotations and warping. Flexural restraints may act at the shear center or may be eccentric. Restraints may be concentrated at points along a column or distributed along portions of its length, and may be rigid or elastic. Oblique flexural restraints cause coupling between the principal axis deflections and rotations, while eccentric flexural restraints cause coupling between the principal axis deflections and rotations and the twist rotations and warping displacements. The general buckling mode involves simultaneous bending about both principal axes and torsion. This paper discusses the nature of oblique eccentric restraints, summarizes their finite element analysis, presents examples of their effects on the elastic buckling of columns, and demonstrates the design of columns with oblique eccentric restraints.

AB - This paper presents the behavior of cold-formed high strength stainless steel sections. The test specimens were cold-rolled from flat strips of duplex and high strength austenitic stainless steel. The material properties of high strength stainless steel square and rectangular hollow sections were determined. Tensile coupons at different locations in cross section were tested. Hence, the distributions of 0.2% proof stress and tensile strength measured in the cross section of cold-formed high strength stainless steel sections were plotted. The material properties of the complete cross section in the cold-worked state were also obtained from stub column tests. Detailed measurements of initial local geometric imperfections of the sections were obtained. The initial local plate imperfection profiles were plotted. Residual stress measurements of the high strength stainless steel sections were also conducted. The membrane and bending residual stress distributions in the cross section of the specimens were obtained. Furthermore, the stub column test strengths were compared with the design strengths.

AB - Although energy dissipation devices (EDDs) have been used as a viable strategy of seismic protection of buildings for many years, current design codes do not provide guidelines for optimizing EDD configurations that may improve the structure’s performance or decrease cost. This paper presents an effective and efficient design methodology to optimize the EDD configuration based on building performance objectives. The proposed strategy, performance-based heuristic optimization approach, uniquely combines the engineering knowledge and an iterative approach to optimize the EDD configuration for optimal structural performance under earthquake conditions. This strategy is capable of minimizing different performance indices of responses, such as interstory drift, roof displacement, acceleration, or base shear. During the optimization process, a modal analysis-based engineering heuristic is used to navigate the large solution space for efficient solutions. This new approach is compared with the evolutionary and the heuristic approaches. Results show that the new approach can effectively address different performance indices, and can efficiently provide the optimal EDD configuration.

AB - Moment-resisting connections containing mechanical fasteners play an important role in energy-absorption capability, and therefore resistance against collapse, of timber frames subjected to loading from extreme events such as earthquake. Accurate characterization of moment–rotation response of these connections is an important prerequisite for reliable prediction of timber frame response to seismic loads. Using a previously developed single-fastener finite element model as a basis, a mathematical model was developed to predict the moment–rotation response of timber connection containing multifasteners under reversed cyclic loading. This model generates the response prediction from basic material properties of the fasteners and wood. This paper describes the development of the model and provides test results to validate the accuracy of the model prediction. It is shown that the predicted response of a multinail connection agrees well with experimental data. Once the model is further validated with a broader range of test results, it can be incorporated into frame analysis models for predicting system response.

AB - Performance-based engineering concepts applied to both structural design and assessment have gained interest among structural engineers and researchers in recent years. Performance-based design applied to building systems includes selection of appropriate structural systems and configurations to ensure that the structure has adequate strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation capacity to respond to loadings, including those arising from natural hazards, without exceeding permissible damage states. Although performance-based design has advanced for some materials and structural types, such as steel and reinforced concrete buildings and bridges built in high seismic regions, the application to light-frame wood structures has only recently been explored. This paper investigates the application of fragility techniques to the seismic design of engineered woodframe shearwalls. The methodology developed herein provides a technical basis for the development of future performance-based design provisions for shearwalls in light-frame structures subject to earthquake loading. In the present study, shearwalls are treated as isolated subassemblies. Nonlinear dynamic time-history analysis is used to predict the performance of the shearwalls considering a suite of suitably scaled characteristic ordinary ground motions taken to represent the seismic hazard. Examples of fragility curves are developed considering peak wall displacement and ultimate uplift force at the hold-down. The effects of nailing schedule, seismic weight, and choice of response modification factor 

(R)

 are considered.

AB - It is well known that shear deformations are of paramount importance in the planar two dimensional (2D) analysis of shear wall systems, both for strains and stresses, so they should be included in the analyses of such systems. Shear deformations are also included in 3D analyses of shear wall systems; however, to the writers knowledge, other writers have not previously assessed the specific impact of shear deformations on the 3D behavior of structures. This technical note presents a study where the impact of shear deformations of wall systems in the location of centers of rigidity or torsion (CTs), static eccentricities

, and spatial distribution of shear forces for shear wall buildings are assessed, comparing them to the results when shear deformations are not included. It is shown that shear deformations associated with the rotational degrees of freedom of walls impact the location of CTs,

, and the relative distribution of shear forces; therefore, the aspect ratio of the walls 

(h∕L)

 is an important variable to consider for these systems. For these systems one cannot define a geometrical locus of the elastic centers of rigidity of the floors, even for systems with the same distribution of walls in all floors.
