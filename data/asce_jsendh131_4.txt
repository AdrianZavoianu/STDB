AB - A post-tensioned friction damped connection (PFDC) for earthquake resistant steel moment resisting frames (MRFs) is introduced. The connection includes friction devices on the beam flanges with post-tensioned high strength strands running parallel to the beam. The connection minimizes inelastic deformation to the components of the connection as well as the beams and columns, and requires no field welding. Inelastic analyses were performed on a six-story, four-bay steel MRF with PFDCs to study its response to strong ground motions. The PFDC–MRF was designed using a performance based design approach. Results show the MRF with PFDCs has good energy dissipation, self-centering capability, and strength. Variability in the maximum friction forces that develop in the friction devices was determined not to have a significant effect on the MRF performance. The analyses indicate that the seismic performance of a MRF with PFDCs can exceed that of a MRF with conventional moment resisting connections.

AB - This paper investigates the structural responses of generally restrained steel beams under fire conditions by the finite-element method. The axial restraint is represented by a linear elastic spring, whereas the rotational restraint is simulated as a semirigid rotational spring. The developments of beam internal forces, cross-sectional stresses and strains, together with displacements are examined. Moreover, the effects of some important factors such as load utilization factor, beam slenderness ratio, and axial and flexural restraint ratios, are also studied. Numerical analyses show that the critical temperature is reduced by axial restraint but increased by semirigid rotational restraint. Some stocky beams subjected to low utilization factors buckle at elevated temperature. The later part of the paper focuses on investigating the effect of cross-sectional thermal gradient; the associated thermal bowing is detrimental for a slender beam. This paper also tabulates the finite-element (FE) predictions of the lower and upper bounds of beam critical temperature for design purposes. Besides FE analyses, the simplified methods from EC3 Pt.1.2 and BS5950 Pt.8 for critical temperature are also examined.

AB - Design and detailing requirements of seismic provisions for concentrically braced frames (CBF) were specified based on the premise that bracing members with low 


KL∕r


 and 


b∕t


 will have superior seismic performance. However, relatively few tests investigate the cyclic behavior of CBF. It is legitimate to question whether the compression member of CBF plays as significant a role as what has been typically assumed explicitly by the design provisions. In this paper, the existing experimental data are reviewed to quantify the extent of hysteretic energy achieved by bracing members in compression in past tests, and the extent of degradation of the compression force upon repeated cycling loading. Although it is recognized that many parameters have an influence on the behavior of braced frames, the focus of this paper is mostly on quantifying energy dissipation in compression and its effectiveness on seismic performance. Based on the experimental data review from previous tests, it is found that the normalized energy dissipation of braces having moderate 


KL∕r


 


(
80–120
)


 do not have significantly more normalized energy dissipation in compression than those having a slenderness in excess of 120. The normalized degradation of the compression force envelope depends on 


KL∕r


 and is particularly severe for W-shaped braces.

AB - The out-of-plane elastic and inelastic flexural-torsional buckling behavior and strength of fixed steel arches are studied in this paper using an advanced finite element model for the three-dimensional nonlinear analysis. The initial out-of-plane geometric imperfections, residual stresses due to manufacturing and curving, yielding, and inelastic flexural-torsional buckling are considered in the investigation. It is found that both the elastic and the inelastic flexural-torsional behavior of fixed arches are quite different from those of pin-ended arches. The strength design equations for pin-ended steel arches cannot be extended directly to fixed steel arches using the effective length method. Design equations for fixed steel arches subjected to uniform compression or to uniform bending, and an interaction equation for the strength check against out-of-plane failure for fixed steel I-section arches subjected to combined bending and axial compressive actions, are proposed.

AB - Acceleration responses of structures with one degree of freedom (1-DOF) under shocks are investigated based on Buckingham’s 

π

 theorem of nondimension. The nondimensional parameters are determined based on equations of motion for the forced vibration of a mass-support system with 1-DOF. The acceleration responses of structures under possible excitations such as continuous sine wave excitations, single half-sine wave excitations, a train of half-sine wave excitations, and earthquake-like motion excitations are predicated by a numerical scheme. A model structural experiment is developed and carried out to validate the above numerical results. They agree with each other very well for all of the excitations. The scaling law is shown to be applicable for frequencies other than the resonance frequencies.

AB - Introducing a fast and accurate method to estimate the seismic demand and capacity of first-mode-dominated multidegree-of-freedom systems in regions ranging from near-elastic to global collapse. This is made possible by exploiting the connection between the static pushover (SPO) and the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). While the computer-intensive IDA would require several nonlinear dynamic analyses under multiple suitably scaled ground motion records, the simpler SPO helps approximate the multidegree-of-freedom system with a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator whose backbone matches the structure’s SPO curve far beyond its peak. Similar methodologies exist but they usually employ oscillators with a bilinear backbone. In contrast, the empirical equations implemented in the static pushover 2 incremental dynamic analysis (SPO2IDA) software allow the use of a complex quadrilinear backbone shape. Thus, the entire summarized IDA curves of the resulting system are effortlessly generated, enabling an engineer-user to obtain accurate estimates of seismic demands and capacities for limit-states such as immediate occupancy or global dynamic instability. Using three multistory buildings as case studies, the methodology is favorably compared to the full IDA.

AB - The prioritization of maintenance interventions on aging structures is one of the most important decision processes in the management of existing civil infrastructure. This process has to consider the uncertainties in loads, resistances, and maintenance interventions over a given time horizon. A computational program for probabilistic maintenance optimization in which the reliability index is the quantitative measure of performance in the presence of uncertainties and the present value of expected cumulative cost is the objective to be minimized has been developed by the writers. Using this program, time-varying uncertainties associated with reliability deterioration of structures and effects of maintenance interventions on the system reliability can be captured efficiently. The aim of this study is to provide insight in the methodology for probabilistic maintenance optimization of aging structures in which the optimum solution is found by minimizing the present value of expected cumulative maintenance and failure costs over a prescribed time horizon. Because of the discreteness in cost profile evaluation and randomness in the feasible domain, the conventional optimization methods are modified by using the branching technique and multidimensional interpolation method. Both time- and reliability-controlled maintenance actions including essential and/or preventive interventions on aging structures are optimized.

AB - This paper presents a practical and user-friendly finite element (FE) model updating technique for real structures using ambient vibration test results. The first case study of a simulated simply supported beam demonstrates a comparative study of the influence of different possible residuals in objective function. Frequency residual only, mode shape related function only, modal flexibility residual only, and their combinations are studied independently. In view of tuning as well as damage localization, full objective function that considers all three residuals is the best for FE updating. This objective function is implemented in a second case study of a real concrete-filled steel tubular arch bridge. The bridge was tested by ambient vibration measurements. Followed by the three-dimensional FE modeling of the bridge, an eigenvalue sensitivity study is carried out to see the most sensitive parameters to the concerned modes. FE model mass matrix obtained from Guyan reduction technique is used to the mass normalization of the mode shapes extracted from ambient modal test to calculate the modal flexibility. The updated FE model of the bridge is able to produce a sufficient improvement on modal parameters of the concerned modes which is in close agreement with the experimental results still preserving the physical meaning of updated parameters.

AB - A robust damage estimation technique is presented such that the location and severity of damages can be estimated in the presence of random errors in measured data as well as systematic errors in the analytical model. In order to estimate damage efficiently, the concept of design of experiment using orthogonal array is used for screening the main effects of each parameter which corresponds to possible damage location in the finite element (FE) model. Then, the Taguchi method, which has been widely used as effective design tools in many areas of engineering, is applied to parameter updating in the analytical FE model in an iterative way. The numerical simulations of truss structures and cantilever beam show that damages in structure can be located in the presence of various noises in measurement as well as systematic errors in the analytical model.

AB - This paper presents a new finite element for the nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) slabs. The element combines a four-node Kirchhoff shell element for concrete with two-node Euler beam elements for the steel reinforcement bars. The connectivity between reinforcement beam elements and concrete shell element is achieved by means of rigid links. By using the transformation method for rigid links, beam nodes are eliminated from the final mesh of the structure. The stiffness and resisting forces from the reinforcement are implicitly included in the new element. In this manner, this finite element is able to take into account the location of the reinforcement bars. This is in contrast to the smeared method, which is often adopted in the layered modeling of RC slabs. The new finite element is verified with experimental results. It is shown that a good agreement exists between the analyses results using the new finite element and the experimental results.

AB - A simplified model of a standing seam metal roof was tested to failure under both uniform and wind tunnel pressures. The model was designed to fail at clips that were calibrated to a scaled strength based on full-scale testing performed at Mississippi State University. The goal of the study was to quantify the relationship between uniform uplift pressure used in standard test procedures and the dynamic pressures that occur during real wind loading that cause failure. An effective external pressure coefficient was formed based on the uniform pressure and mean roof height wind speed that were required to fail the model. This coefficient was compared with 

G
CP


 values suggested by ASCE 7-02. The model indicated that, for a component designed for the corner zone, the ASCE specified design pressures would overestimate the pressures that would be effective in failing a clip by 30%. Comparison between clip load response and the pressures measured on a rigid model demonstrated that the response was closely related to the integrated pressures surrounding the clip using appropriate influence functions.

AB - An analytical procedure for simulating roof snow drift loads is presented. The procedure is based upon the physics of drift formation and consists of two elements. The first element is the transport rate which quantifies the snow flux from the snow source area. The second element is the trapping efficiency which quantifies the percentage of transported snow from the source area which is captured at the drift. Knowing wind speed and snowfall information for a given winter, the procedure can be used to simulate the annual maximum drift for a given snow source area. The method is applied to over 

40
years

 of weather data at each of over 50 NWS first-order sites across the United States. The calculated annual maxima are fit with an extreme value distribution to determine

 drift loads for both roof step and gable roof geometries. It is shown that current leeward roof step drift provisions in ASCE 7-02 as well as gable roof drift provisions proposed for ASCE 7-05 yield loads with something close to a

 OSB or plywood panels. This paper presents the results of a study on the development of a damage-based seismic reliability model for light-frame wood structures subject to earthquake load. It is presented in conceptual form with a simple example for a symmetric one-story woodframe building. The concept presented here provides the basic methodology to calibrate a seismic damage model and compute the structural reliability using a damage-based limit state function. The illustrative example necessitated a small experimental program and the use of existing software. The mechanistic damage model chosen for the example expresses damage as a linear combination of the maximum displacement during an earthquake simulation and the hysteretic energy dissipated by each shearwall within a structure. In order to make the model mechanistic, it was regressively calibrated based on the results of static and dynamic tests conducted on

 wood shearwalls. The fastener spacing on the perimeter of the shearwall sheathing panels was chosen as the design variable of interest, hence all damage model parameters were developed as a function of their spacing. Following calibration, a damaged-based limit state for reliability analysis is developed that enables one to calculate the structural reliability index provided against a prescribed damage level. The result for an example limit state is presented and compared to Federal Emergency Management Agency transient drift performance specifications for collapse prevention.

AB - In this paper, a nonlinear three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of light frame buildings capable of static and dynamic analysis is presented. The model can accommodate various material and structural configurations, including multilevel structures. A customizable commercial general purpose FE code is used in the analytical investigation of the model formulation. The model as presented is capable of predicting the hierarchical response of the structure from the global, such as the maximum displacement, down to the individual demand placed on substructures such as a nailed joint connection. This capability is provided by replacing individual substructure responses, e.g., in-plane responses of shear walls, with energetically equivalent and more computationally efficient nonlinear springs. The predictive ability of the model is experimentally validated, in Part II, based on global and local response comparisons, considering measures of energy dissipation, displacement, and load. Validated, this model provides the analyst a powerful tool to investigate various aspects of light frame building behavior under static and dynamic loading.

AB - In this paper, a nonlinear three-dimensional finite element model, presented in Part I, capable of static and dynamic analysis is compared with the results of an experiment on a full-scale asymmetric light frame building. The predictive ability of the model is experimentally validated based on global and local response comparisons, using measures of energy dissipation, displacement, and load. Comparison of modeling and experimental test results show that the energy dissipation, hysteretic response, the load sharing between the walls, and the torsional response are estimated reasonably well. The model predicts higher order response parameters such as energy dissipation more accurately than load or displacement. Validated, this model provides a tool to investigate various aspects of light frame building behavior under static and dynamic loading.
