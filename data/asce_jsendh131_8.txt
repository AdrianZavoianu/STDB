AB - Some engineers suggest that current seismic design provisions, both for new buildings and for strengthened existing buildings, can improve resistance to blast loads and progressive collapse. However, there have been few attempts to quantify such improvement. To begin analyzing this possible relationship between seismic detailing and blast and progressive collapse resistance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the Department of Homeland Security sponsored a study at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center. The study was an analysis of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, which was severely damaged in a 1995 terrorist attack. The building was first evaluated for seismic vulnerabilities as if it were located in a seismically active region. Three strengthening schemes were then designed for the vulnerabilities found during the evaluation: a pier-spandrel system and a new special concrete moment frame, both for the street face of the building, and a set of internal shear walls. In addition to these strengthening schemes, the original ordinary concrete moment frame on the street face of the building was redetailed to bring it into compliance with current building code provisions, without including a lateral load analysis. The three strengthening schemes and redetailed frame were then analyzed for their responses to the same explosion that occurred in 1995. Blast and corresponding progressive collapse analyses showed that the pier-spandrel and special moment frame schemes, as well as the redetailed original system, reduced the degree of direct blast-induced damage and subsequent progressive collapse, compared with the behavior of the original building. Internal shear walls, however, were not as effective in reducing the blast and progressive collapse damage. A key finding of the study was that strengthening the perimeter elements using current seismic detailing techniques improved the survivability of the building, while strengthening elements internal to the building envelope was not nearly as effective in reducing damage.

AB - This study was conducted utilizing precision impact testing to examine the characteristics of force transfer through cladding panels to an underlying structural support frame. Precision impact tests were conducted monitoring force and acceleration data to characterize load transfer. All specimens were considered identical and the impact loading was varied to provide several test conditions. The findings were that cladding systems may provide buildings with an external barrier capable of reducing short duration loading effects. Most test cases indicated an impact force dissipation of approximately 25–50%, depending on loading conditions.

AB - Exterior wall panels of structures are often constructed of concrete masonry units (CMUs), commonly known as concrete blocks. These walls may become a debris hazard to building occupants when high explosives, for example, a terrorist vehicle bomb, are detonated outside of a building. A recently completed series of physical experiments is being used to develop methods for predicting the hazard levels associated with CMU walls. Retrofitting techniques have been developed to mitigate these hazards. The experiments included nonretrofitted CMU walls as well as several different types of retrofits. Test data, high-speed video, and posttest inspection of the experiments were used to assess the parameters that affect the response of CMU walls and retrofit systems. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to collect data on the blast response of CMU walls so that improvements can be made to the previously developed Wall Analysis Code (WAC).

AB - Recent terrorist attacks indicate the improvised explosive device as the choice terror tactic. Over the past decade, the U.S. Department of Defense has encouraged and sponsored research toward developing methods of reinforcing structures to protect building occupants from the effects of external explosion. The focus of wall reinforcement research has recently shifted from applying stiff fiber-reinforced composites to using lower-strength higher-elongation elastomeric polymers that can be easily applied to the wall interior. This paper presents recent efforts that have demonstrated an innovative use of thin-membrane elastomeric polymers to prevent breaching and collapse of unreinforced masonry walls subjected to blast. The complex array of failure mechanisms observed from recent explosive tests is discussed. Effects of structural and nonstructural parameters are described with the aid of finite-element simulations. Finally, the needs and direction of future blast reinforcement developments are outlined.

AB -  Concrete anchoring systems are commonly used in blast resistant wall systems. These anchoring systems are often subjected to large tensile forces in a short time during an external blast event. Previous research has been conducted on anchoring systems to evaluate their response to cyclic and “shock” loads; however, the ultimate capacities of these systems were not determined, and tests were conducted at relatively slow loading rates. In this paper, testing has been performed to determine the ultimate capacity of various expansion anchors at high loading rates, which is characteristic of most blast events. Ultimately, concrete expansion anchors perform differently at high loading rates and some show improved ultimate performance. This paper will present the experimental findings and provide recommendations for anchor design under blast loads.

AB - To be able to develop and advance blast-retrofit technologies, it is crucial first to be able to develop prediction methodologies and engineering design tools. Therefore, this paper will present the analytical modeling and experimental evaluation of steel-stud wall systems under blast loads. The results of the static full-scale wall tests, as well as the component tests, are used to evaluate the structural performance of the walls and provide recommendations for blast-retrofit systems. The analytical and experimental static results are used to develop the static resistance function for the wall systems, which is incorporated into a single degree of freedom dynamic model. The dynamic model will enable designers to predict the level of performance of the wall system under any explosion threat level. The analytical model conservatively predicted the measured field results with a maximum difference of 20%. The paper will discuss the performance of blast-retrofit wall systems under static and dynamic field tests simulating large vehicle bombs.

AB - One of the main research goals of the Protective Technologies Research and Development Center at Ben Gurion University of the Negev is to develop reliable numerical codes capable of accurately simulating the behavior of structures protected with aluminum foams exposed to explosion-generated blast-wave loads. To achieve this objective, the mechanical properties of aluminum foams under dynamic loads must be known. Several types of experimental investigations were carried out to obtain the mechanical properties of aluminum foams at different strain rates. The tests were conducted using different types of loads: static tests using an Instron compressing machine, dynamic tests using an Instron compressing machine, impact tests using a 

400-kg

 impact pendulum, and shock-wave impact tests using conventional shock tubes. Plots of the volumetric strain as a function of the pressure and the strain rate were obtained, and the numerical codes were calibrated and validated with the aid of the experimental results.

AB - In light of recent terrorist attacks on facilities throughout the world, designers, planners, architects, and engineers are beginning to re-visit conventional approaches in the design of military and high-security facilities. Many existing buildings, structures and facilities should be better protected against man-made explosive hazards. For this reason the designs of public/private structures and facilities are getting much more attention in recent years. This paper presents the results of experimental and numerical investigations that were conducted in order to examine the capabilities of aluminum foams in mitigating the effect of blast waves acting on reinforced concrete (RC) beams and plates. Numerical simulations of the behavior of the investigated RC beams and plates under the dynamic loads support the experimental investigation results. The numerical simulations are based on finite element commercial and in-house codes. The experimental and numerical results for both the protected and unprotected RC beams and the conclusions obtained from these experiments and simulations are presented.

AB - Blast-resistant design has traditionally been considered only for essential government buildings, military structures, and petrochemical facilities. Recent terrorist threats to bridges in California and New York have demonstrated the need to evaluate the vulnerability of our transportation infrastructure. Bridge engineers, however, have not typically considered security in the design process, and most of the current state of knowledge of the design of structures subjected to blast effects is based on the performance of buildings rather than bridges. This paper summarizes the results of ongoing research to develop performance-based blast design standards tailored specifically for bridges. Based on best practices obtained from an international literature review, the paper briefly discusses the incorporation of physical security and site layout principles into the design process. It then discusses the potential effects of blast loads on bridges and provides structural design and retrofit solutions to counter these effects.

AB - Assessing the structural response and vulnerability of bridge piers to collisions by barges typically involves either the use of static pier analysis codes and design-specification-stipulated equivalent static loading conditions, or a lengthy model development process followed by use of general-purpose finite-element codes. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed that leverages the capabilities of existing nonlinear dynamic pier analysis programs by adding dynamic barge behavior in a computationally efficient and modular manner. By coupling nonlinear barge and pier responses together through a shared collision impact force and employing numerical procedures for accelerating convergence of the coupled system, dynamic barge collision analyses may be conducted for bridge piers efficiently and rapidly. The influence of impact parameters such as barge type and mass, impact speed and angle, and pier configuration can then be efficiently evaluated using dynamic collision analyses. For demonstration purposes, the method is implemented in an existing pier analysis program, validated, and used to conduct selected case studies.

AB - A general procedure is presented for the use of higher-order approximations of a system’s dynamic response using new time integration schemes. An implicit method is developed and presented that makes use of higher-order polynomial acceleration variations for multi-degree-of-freedom dynamic structural analyses. A variable 
θ
 is used to increase the stability and accuracy of the method. The relative merits and stability aspects of the method are described. The higher-order method is compared with two traditional implicit methods, the Wilson-
θ
 Method and the Constant Average Acceleration Method of the Newmark family. The peak displacement percent difference and percent time difference to peak displacement are used to measure the accuracy of the methods when applied to a multi-degree-of-freedom frame problem.

AB - This paper investigates the possibility of using changes in the nonlinear characteristics of the reinforced concrete structures under vehicular loads to detect damage. An experimental study is carried out on a Tee-section reinforced concrete beam subject to the action of a moving model vehicle. Vertical accelerations and displacements are measured while the vehicle crosses the bridge. Nonlinearities are detected by examining the changes in the instantaneous frequency when the vehicular loads are at different locations along the beam. Results demonstrated that the large changes in the vibration behavior due to the damage could be amplified by the presence of vehicular load on top of the beam. A damage index, based on the flexural rigidity of the beam, is proposed which can be an indicator for the assessment of reinforced concrete bridge deck under vehicular load.

AB - A nonlinear hardening rule that defines a yield surface translation for homogeneous frame member materials is proposed. The rule is defined as a nonlinear constitutive relationship that examines material behavior through a postelastic perspective. The gradual development of the postelastic states of a beam along its length and through its section thickness is analyzed. The model uses a hardening index parameter to guide the nonlinear stress–strain relationship, and a smooth function to model the web–flange intersection of frame members. As such, nonlinear curvature distributions with continuous derivatives are determined along the length of the member, which enables lateral displacements to be accurately predicted. Plastic hinge lengths and finite-element displacements are subsequently determined, and a nonlinear stiffness is derived. The model is formulated on a constitutive level and applies a smoothed-over cross section to derive a single internal moment expression for any postelastic state. Results are verified through experimental published literature.

AB - A research study has been conducted on a newly proposed design of embedded steel plate composite coupling beams with shear studs in order to improve the performance of reinforced concrete (RC) coupling beams under severe wind or earthquake loading. The experimental results on three coupling beams tested under reversed cyclic loading are discussed in this paper. One of the coupling beams was conventionally reinforced, while each of the other two contained a vertically embedded steel plate along the whole span either with or without shear studs. It was found that embedded steel plates could improve the strength and the stiffness of coupling beams, while shear studs are required to enhance the plate/RC interaction in order to achieve good inelastic performance under large imposed shear deformations. Equations for calculating the required shear connection strength in the beam span to ensure the plate/RC composite action and for estimating the available plate/RC interface slips to mobilize shear studs have been proposed.

AB - Magnetorheolgical (MR) fluid is a kind of smart material whose rheological properties can be rapidly varied by application of a magnetic field. To take full use of the advantages of MR fluid for devices, a double-ended shear mode combined with a valve mode MRF-04K damper has been designed and manufactured, and the dynamic characteristics of the damper under sinusoidal excitation were experimentally studied. The maximum force at a full magnetic field strength is about 20 kN, while the maximum power required is less than 50 W. To accurately reproduce the dynamic behavior of the MRF-04K damper, the modified Bouc–Wen model has been investigated. Comparison with the data between the experimental and the predicted indicates that the modified Bouc–Wen model can accurately portray the behavior of the MRF-04K damper and is appropriate for use in control system design for civil structures.

AB - In the United States the vast majority of single and multifamily homes are constructed using light-frame wood construction which typically consists of dimension lumber sheathed with plywood or oriented strand board. These structures resist lateral loads such as those produced by wind or earthquakes by a system of wood shear walls. One widely used design standard that governs the design of wood shearwalls is the specification provided by American Forest and Paper Association/American Society of Civil Engineers 16 (AF&amp;PA/ASCE-16). This load and resistance factor design (LRFD) design standard (released in 1996) was soft calibrated from the existing allowable stress design code for wood structures, and thus the reliability of wood shear walls designed using AF&amp;PA/ASCE 16 is not explicitly known. To date, no study has evaluated the level of reliability provided by wood shear walls built using accepted design values or prescriptive (deemed-to-comply) procedures. The objective of this study was to examine the strength-based reliability of a portfolio of wood shear walls subjected to earthquake loading. This was one specific task of an ASCE/SEI Special Project entitled Re-evaluation of LRFD for Engineered Wood Products: Keeping Pace with Changes in ASCE 7. The reliability indices were calculated by examining the performance of a portfolio of 12 different wood shear walls, each designed according to AF&amp;PA/ASCE 16. An existing suite of earthquake ground motions for Los Angeles was used to determine seismic demand through a series of nonlinear hysteretic time domain analyses. The results presented herein may be useful in reevaluating existing design codes and can provide guidance to technical committees responsible for maintaining and updating codes and standards.
