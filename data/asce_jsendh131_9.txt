AB - The seismic design of cap beam-to-column bridge joints improved dramatically after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, during which many bridge joints were significantly damaged. Because of high shear force resulting in congested joint reinforcement, researchers began investigating alternative design methods for bridge joints that would produce constructible details. A methodology based on a force transfer model received considerable attention and is now widely used in the United States. This model uses vertical stirrups placed outside of the joint panel to transfer forces across the joint. Using several large-scale bridge joints with varying amounts of cap beam prestressing, this design methodology was investigated under simulated in-plane seismic loading. Although good seismic performance was observed for joints with cap beam prestressing, joints without prestressing in the cap beam failed at moderate to large displacement ductilities. Supported by experimental data, strut-and-tie analysis was performed on three bridge tee joints. The analysis identified shortcomings of the design force transfer model and revealed that the design model could be simplified with subsequent reduction to the reinforcement in the joint region when applied to prestressed joints.

AB - Experimental investigation and subsequent analytical studies have shown that the external strut force transfer method of design is insufficient for reinforced concrete bridge joints and overly conservative for prestressed joints, particularly under in-plane seismic loading. Despite these findings, this design method is widely endorsed for use in seismic design practice in the United States. In consideration of the shortcomings of the currently used force transfer model for bridge joints, an improved design model, referred to hereafter as the modified external strut force transfer model, is introduced in this paper. Use of the modified model for bridge tee and knee joints, design equations, a set of prescriptive design steps in a readily applicable form, and reinforced and prestressed concrete bridge joint design examples are also presented.

AB - Seismic analyses typically neglect four important phenomena that contribute to the complex interaction between bridges and approach embankments: three-dimensional embankment response, nonlinear soil behavior, soil–structure interaction, and embankment scattering. To identify the importance of each phenomena, a modeling approach was adopted that can be implemented with commonly available soil and structure properties, and whose computational demands are sufficiently low to perform numerous dynamic analyses. The accuracy of the methodology was established by comparing measured and computed abutment acceleration response histories, response spectra, structural periods, damping ratios, and abutment stiffnesses for several bridges. Parametric studies indicated that, to maintain accuracy over a range of earthquake intensities, it is important to consider three-dimensional embankment effects and to specify soil properties accurately. In contrast, the computed response was nearly insensitive to the effects of embankment scattering and changes in embankment geometry, including the embankment height.

AB - A new earthquake design method performing iterative calculations for secant stiffness was developed. Since basically the proposed design method uses linear analysis, it is convenient and stable in numerical analysis. Moreover, the proposed design method can accurately estimate the inelastic strength and ductility demands of structural members through iterative calculations. In the present study, the procedure of the proposed design method was established, and a computer program incorporating the proposed design procedure was developed. Design examples were presented to verify the advantages of the proposed method. The proposed method, an integrated analysis and design method, can address the earthquake design strategy intended by the engineer, such as limited ductility of the member and the concept of strong column-weak beam. The strength and ductility demands satisfying the given design strategy can be directly determined for all the members. As a result, structural safety and economical design can be achieved.

AB - The influence of mass irregularity on building seismic response is examined for an eight-story concentrically braced steel frame with different setback configurations resulting in sudden reductions in plan dimensions and seismic weight along the height of the structure. Three locations of mass discontinuity were considered (25, 50, and 75% of the building height), together with two ratios of seismic weight (200 and 300%). A reference regular structure was also considered for comparison. The design of each structure was performed according to the proposed 2005 National Building Code of Canada NBCC provisions using two analysis methods: The equivalent static force procedure and the response spectrum analysis method. Although severe, the mass irregularity conditions considered in this study were found to have a limited negative impact on the seismic performance of the structures designed with the static analysis method. The performance of irregular structures exhibiting lower performance could be improved by using the dynamic analysis method in design, but not to the level achieved by the reference regular structure.

AB - The commentary to the AISC-LRFD Specification addresses the design of framing systems containing partially restrained (PR) connections, but it does not provide specific guidance on how to analyze these types of systems to determine appropriate internal forces for design. In addition, it provides little information on how to select an appropriate connection stiffnesses for design calculations, such as the calculation of effective length factors. This paper presents an approach that allows for the consideration of nonlinear connection response using commonly available elastic analysis software. In addition, the application of the direct analysis approach to PR framing systems is presented in the context of the proposed method for handling the connection nonlinearity. The direct analysis approach allows for stability to be assessed using the AISC-LRFD beam-column interaction equations with the axial strength term 


Pn


 determined based on the actual member length. This eliminates the complexity of determining effective length factors for partially restrained framing.

AB - An experimental investigation of cold-formed steel lipped angle concentrically loaded compression members is presented in this paper. The angle specimens were tested between fixed-ended conditions at various column lengths. Local buckling, flexural buckling, flexural-torsional buckling, and interaction of these buckling modes were observed in the column tests. Detailed measurements of geometric imperfections and material properties of the specimens were conducted. The purpose of this paper is to provide test data for concentrically loaded compression members of cold-formed steel lipped angles. In addition, the test strengths were compared with the design strengths predicted using the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. It is concluded that the design strengths predicted by the specification and standard are conservative without considering the required additional bending moment using an eccentricity of 

1∕1,000

 of the column length.

AB - Simple two-dimensional frames are normally used when building bays. These frames are placed in series and held longitudinally with bracings. These two directions, transversal and longitudinal, are independent of each other. Thus, the transverse frame bears loads in its plane with no help from the longitudinal bracings. In the case of transverse rigid frames, with the typology described, the columns act as bending brackets, requiring large-size columns and large foundations. Against the traditional typology, an alternative can be the usage of special on-roof bracings called “harp bracings.” With these harp bracings, the loads received by the columns are partially transmitted to the endwall frame. In this way, the columns tend to behave as encastered-supported elements, which require smaller section size and foundations. This paper presents a comparative study between rigid frames, solved with traditional bracings, and harp bracings. Spans from 

10
to
35
m

 are considered, as well as bay lengths from 

20
to
50
m

. The contrast between these bracing systems is made using the budgets for the whole bay frame, including metallic frame and foundations. The results show the advantages of the harp bracings versus the traditional bracing.

AB - This paper introduces a new, structural wood–concrete composite system. The system is formed by joining a wood component, such as a floor beam or laminated plate, to a concrete slab utilizing a continuous steel mesh of which one half is glued into a slot in the wood while the other half is embedded into the concrete. Two series of tests were performed and are presented: static push-out tests (to establish shear properties of the connector) and a full scale bending test with a span of approximately 

10
m

. Test results reveal that the steel mesh performs favorably—as a stiff yet ductile shear connector between the wood and the concrete. Design equations, per European standards (in absence of North American standards) are described and used to predict the failure load of the bending test. Calculations indicate that the tested beam performs with near full composite action—specifically, 97% effective stiffness and 99% strength of that of a beam with full composite action. This is a marked improvement in the efficiency of wood–concrete systems developed to date. The system shows itself to be superior to alternative systems in its high structural efficiency as well as being relatively easy to install and economic.

AB - The performance of a prestressed concrete beam, subjected to bending moment 
M
 together with shear force 
V
, has been the object of many studies and is an important aspect to take into account in the design. Some models, proposed by researchers and international codes, evaluate the shear strength of prestressed beams by modifying the truss model by Morsch, so as to account for the different slope of stress fields in the web due to the prestressing action. More recent approaches add a strut-and-tie model to the traditional truss model. This paper generalizes a model that was previously proposed for box and I-shaped reinforced concrete cross sections of structural elements. The model, that now includes the effect of prestressing tendons, considers variable-depth stress fields applied to the cross section, subdivided into layers, and allows evaluation of normalized 

m–v

 design domains depending both on the web and flange reinforcement and on the slope of the prestressing steel tendons. The reliability of the method has been validated by comparing its numerical results to the strength provided by tests on reinforced concrete beams and on thin-webbed prestressed concrete beams, referred to in the literature. Finally, it has been used in the design of a pretensioned bridge beam to evaluate the additional reinforcement necessary in the flanges, as a function of the reinforcement provided to the web.

AB - Analyses of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures based on a smeared crack approach generally include a tension stiffening relationship to estimate the average concrete tensile stress after cracking. Many such equations have been developed over the years and show significant differences between them. In this study, three of these equations are compared and it is shown that the variation between the equations can be explained by the different bond conditions of the specimens tested to calibrate the equations. An expression is proposed to quantify this effect and sample results are shown. Use of this relationship should allow more realistic estimates of crack width and stiffness at service loads to be obtained.

AB - A model is proposed for predicting the compression behavior of axially loaded concrete cylinders confined by fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) shells. To capture the active confinement applied by the FRP, an orthotropic hypoelasticity-based constitutive law is used for the concrete. This law is defined the triaxial stress space. The confinement-induced concrete strength enhancements are computed from a four-parameter failure surface. The corresponding peak strain increase is computed using a newly proposed strain enhancement factor. The FRP shell behavior is modeled using a stress-strain relation for plane stress orthotropic laminated composites. The proposed model is implemented into an incremental approach for the analysis of compression tests. No iterations are needed to find the stresses corresponding to prescribed axial strains. The model is verified with correlation studies with different experimental tests on concrete-filled FRP cylinders.

, used in design to account for the load-duration effect were developed through long-term testing of wood members in flexure, yet they are applied to wood connections as well. This study examines time-effect factors for steel-doweled wood connections. In this study, long-term tests were performed on small-scale wood connection specimens, and the resulting time-to-failure data were used to calibrate two cumulative damage (CD) models. A numerical approach was developed for calibrating existing CD models to the test data. Step load tests also were performed on full-scale bolted connection specimens and the results were compared to the results predicted by the CD models fit to the long-term data. The calibrated CD models were then used in a relatively simple procedure to determine an approximate

AB - Wood frame walls are essential subassemblies used to transmit roof, floor, wind, and seismic loads into lower stories and eventually into the foundation of light-frame structures. There has been some discussion and debate in recent years over appropriate system factors for use in the design of repetitive wall members, which typically are much smaller in the cross section than floor joists. In addition to having greater flexibility than floors, wood stud walls also may be subject to the actions of combined loads, and their load-sharing behavior may be significantly influenced by the presence of openings. As a precursor to evaluating system factors for design, this study investigated load-sharing and system effects in light-frame walls subject to combined axial and transverse loads. An analytical model was developed to account for partial composite action, load-sharing, two-way action, and openings in the wall system. The model consisted of two main components: A system model and a member model. The system model was a beam-spring analog model with spring stiffnesses obtained from the member model. The member model was a beam-column model which took into account partial composite action between the stud and the sheathing and possible end restraints. After validating the model using experimental test data from other studies, it was incorporated into a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the strength and reliability of light-frame wall systems subject to combined axial and transverse loads. Sensitivity studies were performed to investigate how system parameters affected the wall system strength and reliability. Critical load combinations were determined external to the reliability analysis. Reliabilities were then evaluated using a portfolio of representative light-frame wall systems designed according to current code provisions.

AB - Different methods are proposed in literature using experimental modal information to detect possible damage. In this paper a finite-element (FE) model updating technique is applied. The unknown properties of a FE model are adapted, such that the differences between experimental modal data (modal curvature in combination with eigenfrequencies and mode shapes) and the corresponding analytical predictions are minimized. An iterative sensitivity based algorithm is used for solving this optimization problem. The method is applied to the damage assessment of a gradually damaged prestressed concrete beam. It is assumed, that damage can be characterized by reducing the bending stiffness. The main focus of this paper is to analyze the influence of using modal curvatures. In contrast to eigenfrequencies and mode shapes, modal curvatures are very sensitive to local changes of the bending stiffness nearby the sensor location, but insensitive to local changes far from the measurement location.

AB - This study deals with a method to identify structural damage using the combined finite element method and the advanced uniform microgenetic algorithm. The novelty of this study is the use of dynamic loading and its response due to the anomalies in a structure under testing. The technique described in this paper may allow us not only to detect the damaged elements but also to find their numbers, locations, and the extent of damage. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, the algorithm is applied to a cantilever beam and plate structures with defects. In addition, a laminated composite plate is tested numerically using the first shear deformation theory, and the effect of noise is simulated to study the influence of measurement errors and uncertainty of the method. The results demonstrate the excellencies of the method from the standpoints of computation efficiency as well as its ability to avoid premature convergence.
