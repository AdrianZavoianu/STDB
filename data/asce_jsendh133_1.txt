AB - A wind and structural health monitoring system (WASHMS) was installed in the Tsing Ma suspension bridge in Hong Kong in 1997. On September 16, 1999, Typhoon York, which was the strongest typhoon since 1983 and the typhoon of the longest duration on record, crossed over Hong Kong. All vehicles, except trains, were prohibited from running on the bridge for 

2.5
h

. This event provided a distinctive opportunity to examine the existing analytical models for predicting dynamic response of long suspension bridges to high winds and running trains. The field measurement data recorded by the WASHMS during this event were therefore analyzed and the four particular cases were identified and discussed in this paper. The four particular cases identified included: (1) the bridge without any vehicles; (2) the bridge with one train; (3) the bridge with two trains running in opposite directions; and (4) the bridge with three running trains. The mean wind speed was almost perpendicular to the bridge alignment in the four cases to facilitate the comparison with analytical results. For each case, wind characteristics, bridge acceleration responses, and bridge displacement responses were analyzed using the measurement data from anemometers, accelerometers, and level sensing systems, respectively. The number of trains running on the bridge, train speed, and train location were also identified using the measurement data from strain gauges. The measurement results clearly demonstrated the dynamic behavior of the bridge with running trains during high winds. The measurement results obtained will also be used to verify the analytical model developed by the authors in the companion paper.

AB - The field measurement results of the Tsing Ma suspension bridge under cross winds and running trains during Typhoon York have been presented in Part I of this study. The field measurement results are used in this paper (Paper II) to verify, to some extent, the finite element based framework developed by the writers in the time domain for predicting dynamic response of coupled train and bridge systems in cross winds. In this regard, a three-dimensional finite element model is used to model the Tsing Ma suspension bridge. Wind forces acting on the bridge are generated in the time domain using a fast spectral representation method and based on the field measurement results and wind tunnel test results. Each coach in a train running on the bridge is modeled by a 

27
degree

-of-freedom dynamic system. The dynamic interaction between the bridge and the train is realized through the contact forces between the wheels and the track. Track irregularity is simulated using a high-order multivariate autoregressive model, whereas wheel hunting is assumed to be a sinusoidal function with a random phase. The acceleration and displacement responses of the bridge under cross winds and running trains are computed and compared with the responses measured from the field for four cases. The comparison is found to be satisfactory in general. The dynamic response and performance of trains on the bridge is also computed and evaluated. The proposed framework is found to be feasible and practical.

AB - Analysis of an aeroelastic bridge system consisting of the fundamental vertical and torsional modes of vibration offers an expeditious assessment of bridge flutter performance. It also produces valuable insight into the multimode coupled bridge response to strong winds. This paper presents closed-form formulations for estimating the modal frequencies, damping ratios, and coupled motions of the bimodal coupled aeroelastic bridge system at varying wind velocities. The derivation of these formulations is based on the assumption of low-level damping of the aeroelastic bridge system. This assumption has also been adopted in current modeling of self-excited forces and the analysis of coupled flutter through complex eigenvalue analysis. This framework leads to a formula for determining the critical flutter velocity of bridges with generic bluff deck sections, which not only provides an analytical basis for Selberg’s empirical formula, but also serves as its extension to generic bridges. This formula gives a single parameter or index as a function of flutter derivatives to describe the flutter efficiency of a given bridge section, which facilitates comparison of aerodynamic characteristics of different bridge deck sections. The accuracy of the proposed framework is illustrated through long span bridge examples with a variety of structural and aerodynamic characteristics. Based on the proposed framework, the significance of structural and aerodynamic characteristics on the development of coupled motion and the evolution of modal damping is discussed, which helps to better understand how and where bridges may be tailored for better flutter performance. It is pointed out that coupled bridge flutter is initiated from the modal branch that has a higher modal frequency and is characterized by coupled motion in which torsional motion lags vertical motion. The generation of coupled flutter instability is driven by the negative damping effect caused by the coupled self-excited forces.

AB - This paper summarizes research done to evaluate the effect of axial compression on unreinforced brick masonry (URM) walls and various rehabilitation techniques for enhancing seismic performance of URM structures. Flexural behavior of slender piers subjected to repeated and reversed in-plane deflections, and varied axial compression, is summarized relative to FEMA 356. The effectiveness of four rehabilitation techniques for improving seismic resistance are examined: (1) adhered fiber-reinforced polymer strips; (2) reinforced shotcrete overlay; (3) ferrocement surface coating; and (4) grouted reinforcing bars within drilled cores. The effectiveness of each technique is judged relative to the lateral strength and ductility of control piers with no rehabilitation, which are governed by a nonlinear, elastic rocking mode of behavior. Experimental results suggest that rocking behavior may be equal to, or superior to that of retrofitted piers because of the large ductility capacity at the component level. Test results also indicate that the FEMA 356 document conservatively characterizes seismic capacity for both nonrehabilitated and rehabilitated unreinforced masonry piers.

AB - The use of high-strength concrete (HSC) in seismically active regions poses a major concern because of the brittle nature of the material. The confinement requirements for HSC columns may be prohibitively stringent since they require proportionately greater confinement than columns of normal-strength concrete. An alternative to conventional confinement reinforcement is the use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) casings, in the form of a stay-in-place formwork. This paper investigates the use of stay-in-place FRP formwork as concrete confinement reinforcement for HSC columns with square cross sections. Large scale HSC building columns, encased in FRP casings, were tested under simulated seismic loading. The columns had 

270
mm

 square sections and concrete strengths up to 

90
MPa

. The casings were manufactured from carbon FRP and epoxy resin. The unique aspects of the test program were the introduction of the corner radius as a test parameter, and the presence of internally placed FRP crossties, integrally built with column casings, to improve the effectiveness of concrete confinement. Results indicate that the deformation capacity of HSC columns can be improved significantly by using FRP casings. The results further indicate that the confinement effectiveness of columns is significantly affected by the corner radius of casings. Additionally, the confinement efficiency can be improved with the use of FRP crossties. The columns developed inelastic drift capacities of up to 11%, demonstrating the usefulness of FRP stay-in-place formwork in improving deformability of HSC columns.

AB - The collapses of building structures during recent earthquakes have raised many questions regarding the adequacy of current seismic provisions to prevent a partial or total collapse. They have also brought up questions as to how to determine the collapse safety margin of structures, what is the inherent collapse safety margin in code-designed structures, and how to strengthen structures to effectively augment such margin. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of the analytical methods that are currently available to assess the capacity of building structures to resist an earthquake collapse, point out the limitations of these methods, describe past experimental work in which specimens are tested to collapse, and identify what is required for an accurate evaluation of the seismic collapse capacity of a structure and the safety margin against such a collapse. It is contended that further research is needed before the collapse capacities of structures and their safety margin against collapse may be evaluated with confidence.

AB - This paper proposes application of single and multiple semiactive variable stiffness tuned mass dampers (STMD/SMTMD) for response control of multistory structures under several types of excitation. A new semiactive control algorithm is developed based on real-time frequency tracking of excitation signal by short time Fourier transform. A parametric study is performed in the frequency domain to investigate the dynamic characteristics and effectiveness of STMDs. Time history responses of single-degree-of-freedom and five-degree-of-freedom structures equipped with STMDs at the roof level, subjected to harmonic, stationary, and nonstationary excitations are presented. STMD/SMTMD are most effective when they have low damping ratios and the excitation frequency can be tracked. They are superior than their passive counterparts in reducing the response of the main structure both under force and base excitations. In case the fundamental frequency changes due to damage or deterioration of the main structure then the TMD will be off-tune; hence, it will lose its effectiveness significantly, whereas, the STMD is robust against such changes as it is always tuned to the excitation frequency.

AB - Although steel single angle sections are commonly used as beams to support distributed loads which cause biaxial bending and torsion, their behavior may be extremely complicated, and the accurate prediction of their strengths very difficult. Further, many design codes do not have design rules for torsion, while some recommendations are unnecessarily conservative, or are of limited application, or fail to consider some effects which are thought to be important. This paper is one of a series on the behavior and design of single angle section steel beams. Two previous papers have studied the biaxial bending and torsion of restrained beams, a third has studied the lateral buckling of unrestrained beams, a fourth the biaxial bending of unrestrained beams, and a fifth and sixth the buckling and torsion of unrestrained beams. In each paper, simple design methods have been developed. In this present paper, an approximate method of predicting the second-order deflections and twist rotations of steel equal angle section beams under biaxial bending and torsion is developed. This method is then used to determine the approximate maximum biaxial bending moments in such beams, which are then used with the section moment capacity proposals of the first paper and the lateral buckling proposals of the third paper to approximate the member capacities.

AB - This paper presents an analytical model developed to predict the behavior of concentrically loaded cold-formed square hollow structural section (HSS) slender columns, strengthened with high-modulus carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets. The model predicts the load versus axial and lateral displacements, and accounts for plasticity of steel, the built-in through-thickness residual stresses, geometric nonlinearity, initial out-of-straightness imperfection, and the contribution of CFRP sheets. The model was verified using test results. Since the gains in strength due to CFRP retrofitting of the tested columns were found to be sensitive to the inherent out-of-straightness, the model was used to uncouple the effects of out-of-straightness and CFRP reinforcement ratio. It was shown that axial strength and stiffness of HSS columns could be increased substantially when retrofitted with longitudinal CFRP sheets, due to reduction of the lateral displacement induced by buckling. It was also shown that CFRP effectiveness increases for columns with larger out-of-straightness deficiencies and columns of higher slenderness ratios.

AB - Two exterior moment connections with a steel-encased reinforced concrete (SRC) column and a steel beam were tested to evaluate the cyclic performance. Continuity plates were eliminated in the first specimen, and about 60% of the transverse reinforcement as specified in the ACI 318 was used in the connection region. Two steel doubler plates offsetting from the column web were used to enhance the shear resistance of the connection. The second specimen used a steel jacket to confine the concrete in the connection region and continuity plates were extended from the steel column to the steel jacket to mobilize the shear resistance of the latter; no transverse reinforcement was used. Full-scale test results showed that both specimens were able to reach an interstory drift ratio in excess of 4%. An analytical model was developed for the concrete shear force transfer mechanism in the connection of the second specimen. This study showed that: (1) using either doubler plates or jacket plates was effective to enhance the shear capacity in the connection, (2) concrete shear resistance degraded before the maximum applied load was reached in the first specimen, (3) the concrete was mobilized to resist shear in the second specimen, and (4) transverse reinforcement as required by the ACI 318 (1995) can be relaxed as long as another shear-resisting mechanism such as doubler plates or jacket plates is provided.

AB - A model for use in simulating the response of reinforced concrete interior beam–column joints is developed and evaluated using an extensive experimental data set. This model builds on previous work by Lowes and Altoontash in 2003, modifying the previously proposed model to improve prediction of response and extend the range of applicability. First, a new element formulation is proposed to improve simulation of joint response mechanisms. Second, a new method for simulating the shear stress-strain response of the joint core is developed. This method assumes joint shear is transferred through a confined concrete strut and simulates strength loss due to load history and joint damage following yielding of beam longitudinal steel. Third, modifications are made to enable better simulation of anchorage zone response. Comparison of simulated and observed response histories indicates that the new model represents well stiffness and strength response parameters for joints with a wide range of design parameters.

AB - The flexural strength of externally prestressed beams depends on the tendon stress at failure. If the tendon is free to slip at the deviators its stress will depend on the global deformation of the whole structure. Thus the tendon stress at failure, and consequently, the flexural strength cannot be evaluated by a local analysis of the critical sections, but a nonlinear analysis of the whole beam-tendon structural system is required. In the past, simplified formulas were proposed to calculate the tendon stress increment at failure avoiding the need for a nonlinear analysis of the entire structure. Some of these formulas have been adopted as code recommendations. Some approaches however do not seem to be consistent with the actual behavior of externally prestressed beams and in some cases excessively high increments of stress are recommended. On the other hand, other approaches appear to be too conservative. In this work a new simplified and rational method of analysis based on shape functions approximating deformations is proposed to study the tendon stress increment and consequently the flexural strength of externally prestressed concrete beams. The proposed simplified method reduces the analysis of externally prestressed structures from a global structure problem to an easier section problem.

AB - Cross-laminated solid wood panels are used in timber structures as load bearing plates and shear panels. Since timber is a relatively soft construction material, the design of such structures is driven by serviceability criteria. Therefore, accurate elastic properties are required. In this paper a fully automated procedure to determine global elastic properties of full-scale cross-laminated wood panels is developed. Experimental modal analysis is used to determine resonance frequencies and mode shapes of rectangular wooden specimens. An analytical model based on Reddy’s higher order plate theory is applied to calculate natural frequencies and mode shapes numerically. Corresponding frequencies are allocated using the modal assurance criterion. All three shear moduli and the two in-plane stiffness moduli are identified successfully by minimizing the difference between measured and estimated resonance frequencies in a total least squares sense. By comparing resonance frequencies and additionally by a static bending experiment, it is shown that the global mechanical behavior of the specimen is accurately described using an orthotropic, homogenized, linear elastic material behavior.

AB - This paper proposes a methodology based on the gust response factor (GRF) for evaluating the along-wind response of wind turbine towers. The approach presented differs from conventional GRF methods as the GRF contains contributions from two resonant modes, mainly due to blade/tower interaction effects. The wind turbine tower model considered contains two interconnected flexible subsystems, representing the tower and the rotor system. Each component is initially modeled as a separate degree-of-freedom (DOF), and these are coupled together to form a two DOF reduced order model of the coupled tower/rotor system. Thus, the resonant component of the response contains energy output from the two modes of the coupled system. The GRF is obtained for both tower tip displacement and base bending moment through numerical integration, with a closed form expression included for the former. A series of numerical examples are included to investigate the magnitude of GRFs obtained for the two DOF assembly which allows for blade/tower interaction, and these are compared with GRF values obtained from an equivalent singe DOF model which ignores blade/tower interaction by lumping the mass of the blades in with that of the nacelle.

AB - Tests conducted on oriented strand board (OSB) webbed wood I-joists with web openings revealed that the typical failure mode was that the OSB fractured from tension zones around an opening, with cracks developing diagonally toward the joist flanges. The joist collapsed when the cracks reached the flanges. Finite-element models were developed using ABAQUS to simulate joist behavior. Material nonlinearity, crack propagation, and joist failure were dealt with by a user-defined subroutine. Good correlation was obtained between the test and the analytical results. The finite-element models were then used to investigate the effect of opening size and location on the behavior of joists. The lower bound and the upper bound of the load bearing capacity of joists with openings were found by finite- element modeling and were empirically expressed by polynomials.
