AB - A three-dimensional surrogate model is presented for the seismic performance assessment of cylindrical atmospheric liquid storage tanks. The proposed model consists of a concentrated fluid mass attached to a single vertical beam-column element that rests on rigid beam-spokes with edge springs. The model is suitable for rapid static and dynamic seismic performance assessment. Contrary to other simplified models for tanks, its properties are determined through a simple structural analysis that can be performed in any nonlinear analysis software, without the need for complex finite-element models. The results compare favorably to those of three-dimensional finite-element models on three tanks of varying aspect ratios. A step-by-step example of the modeling procedure is presented for a squat unanchored tank, and a sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to investigate the effect of various modeling parameters on the seismic response of the proposed tank model.

AB - This paper presents a damage-evaluation method that estimates the damage level of buildings using ambient vibration measurement and a seismic interferometry technique. A new index, named slowness change and which directly relates the reduction in story stiffness to the vibration signal’s travel-time delays in propagating waves, is introduced. The sensitivity of the slowness change to damage was examined through ambient vibration testing for a quarter-scale steel frame, where damage was simulated by removing steel links at member ends. The slowness changes computed from the measurement data increased significantly as the number of fractures increased and the story stiffness decreased. The results showed a strong relationship between the location and amount of simulated fractures and the slowness change. The paper also discusses the signal-processing and measurement parameters required to accurately identify the parameters of the propagating waves, error associated with signal processing and measurement, and a borderline between detectable and undetectable damage for both beam fractures and column fractures in steel frames.

AB - Seismic energy dissipation systems are typically installed in buildings within diagonal or chevron bracing to improve the seismic performance by reducing drift, and under certain conditions by reducing acceleration. Alternative installation methods have been developed in which novel mechanisms are used to magnify the displacements within the damping system, and thus improve performance when drift is small, and to reduce the cost of the damping system. Examples are the lever-arm, the toggle-brace, the coupled-truss, and the scissor-jack damper systems, which have found a limited number of applications. All damping system installation methods visually and physically obstruct an otherwise accessible area within the bay of the frame to which they are installed. This drawback has resulted in the occasional rejection of use of damping systems by architects. This paper introduces a novel configuration for damping devices with the main advantage of preserving open space within the frame of installation (hence the name open space damping system). The paper introduces the concept, presents the theory, and then presents computational models to verify the theory and to investigate the effects of the frame configuration, frame deformations, large rotations of the damping system, and frame inelastic action on the effectiveness of the system.

AB - Strengthening of deteriorating structural members by fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) is an increasingly common and validated technique; however, concerns over means to evaluate the long-term durability of these retrofits exist. This paper explores a novel approach to overcome this concern through the use of a novel self-sensing composite material. Specifically, the objective of this paper is to provide a proof of concept for an integrated strengthening and sensing methodology for structural steel members achieved via infusing more-traditional composites with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). To assess the strengthening and sensing capabilities of the CNT-based composite, a set of unidirectional tensile tests were conducted. The experimental results show stiffness increases and strain reductions due to the application of the CNT-based sensing composites that were in close agreement with both analytical and finite-element models. The sensing aspect was also validated by a corresponding linear change in resistance of the CNT-based sensor with increasing load up to the point at which debonding of the adhesive layer occurred. The nanotube sensing layer is able to capture the strain in the member as well as the onset and extension of interfacial debonding.

AB - The lateral torsional buckling (LTB) equations in some current standards are based on unified equations that are a fit to a large body of experimental test data. However, these curves tend to overestimate the capacities from finite-element (FE) simulations based on typical idealized end conditions, residual stresses, and geometric imperfections. Uniform moment tests conducted on various types of cross sections have led to proposed modifications of the current specification for LTB equations. This paper investigates and recommends, by means of FE test simulations, the use of the modified equations with additional improvements for moment gradient cases. The emphasis of the studies is on rolled I-section members. Specifically, the paper demonstrates an inelastic Cb effect that can be particularly significant for beams in which the maximum moment occurs within the unbraced length rather than at a braced point. A new way of applying the LTB modification factor, Cb, in the inelastic LTB region for these cases is recommended for ordinary application of current standard resistance equations. Also, it is shown that this effect can also be captured seamlessly via an explicit inelastic buckling analysis using stiffness-reduction factors (SRFs) derived from the design resistance curves.

AB - Observations following recent earthquakes, and from structural testing, indicate numerous brittle compression failures in reinforced concrete seismic-resisting walls. This is unexpected, as most seismic-resisting walls are designed to be tension-controlled. The problematic compressive response led to two independent studies, each individually aimed at identifying design and loading parameters that affect the seismic deformability of the compression regions (or boundary elements) of seismic-resisting walls. These experimental studies are combined here for a more complete understanding. Both studies used axially loaded, rectangular reinforced concrete specimens that simulate seismic-resisting wall boundary elements. The rectangular prisms were tested under cyclic axial loading or monotonic compression, with a focus on the following parameters: boundary element detailing classification, detailing of transverse reinforcement, maximum tensile strain preceding compressive demand, and cross-sectional aspect ratio. Test results indicate that expected strength and deformation capacity can be overestimated unless a rectangular hoop restrains every longitudinal reinforcing bar; use of crossties does not guarantee stability of the longitudinal reinforcement. Tensile strains of 2 and 5%, imposed prior to reaching the compressive capacity, resulted in compression strength reductions of 20 and 50%, respectively, indicating that load-history can also be important.

AB - This paper presents an analysis–redesign-type approach for the efficient seismic design of three-dimensional (3D) irregular RC frame structures for bidirectional ground motions. The designs obtained using the approach satisfy interstory drift and ductility limits while having the minimum total moment capacity of all seismic members. This leads to cost-efficient designs because the total amount of steel as well as the base shear and overturning moments are relatively low. While doing that, the approach is very intuitive and is relatively simple to implement in practice because it only requires analysis tools, not background knowledge or tools related to optimization theory. The examples show that the proposed methodology requires only a few analyses and converges to designs that exactly satisfy the design objectives with limited amounts of steel assigned only where required. This makes the design approach feasible for practice in terms of computational effort and time.

AB - This paper examines the accuracy of design equations specified in the North American, European, and Australasian codes for cold-formed steel structures in determining the ultimate tilt-bearing capacity of single-shear bolted connections without washers in flat steel sheets. It points out that all the code equations do not properly distinguish the tilt-bearing failure mode from the conventional bearing failure mode. While the latter takes place downstream of the bolt, the former takes place upstream. Unlike the conventional bearing capacity, the tilt-bearing capacity is affected by the width of the connected sheet and does not vary linearly with either the sheet thickness or the bolt diameter. Furthermore, it is not affected by material ductility. Based on the test results of 156 specimens composed of G2 and G450 sheet steels having various dimensional configurations, this paper proposes a design equation that is dimensionally consistent and that is considerably more accurate than all the code equations. The proposed equation was also verified against single-shear single-row bolted connections tested by independent researchers which failed in the tilt-bearing mode. The verified thicknesses ranged from 0.92 to 3.0&nbsp;mm, and the bolt diameters ranged from 6.4 to 16&nbsp;mm. An additional finding is that the tilt-bearing capacity is not significantly affected by the orientation of the bolt head or nut. A resistance factor of 0.75 is recommended for use with the proposed equation for determining the tilt-bearing capacity of single shear single-row bolted connections in cold-reduced steel sheets.

AB - The tuned viscous mass damper (TVMD) and tuned inerter damper (TID) are tuned inerter-based dampers (TIBDs) that can utilize amplified apparent mass and tuning effects. This study investigated the use of multiple TIBDs to mitigate the seismic responses of multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structures. The locations and modes for tuning the TIBDs were analyzed by defining a placement index based on the H2 norm. The parameters of TVMDs and TIDs distributed throughout the structure and tuned to multiple modes were optimized by minimizing the H2 performance of the objective responses. The equivalent stiffness and damping of the TVMD and TID were considered to demonstrate TIBD control mechanisms, such as significant additional damping at the resonance frequency. As examples, 3-story and 10-story buildings were subjected to earthquakes with different spectra characteristics to validate the effectiveness of TIBD schemes. The results showed that distributed TIBDs tuned to properly selected modes significantly reduce the root-mean-square (RMS) responses of displacement and acceleration and perform superior than the viscous dampers and viscous mass dampers in reducing the peak displacement.

AB - The prediction of the extreme value of the wind pressure receives significant attention from the wind engineering community. However, the correlation among extreme wind pressures associated with different locations on the building surface is less addressed. In this study, the characterization of the dependence structure of extreme wind pressures and its application to roofing damage estimation are presented. First, three methods to model the dependence structure of extreme wind pressures, including multivariate extreme value theory, copula function, and Nataf transformation, are reviewed. Then, the asymptotic property of the bivariate non-Gaussian random vector will be established and the partial correlation for the data within finite duration is discussed. Furthermore, the dependence structure and asymptotical properties of extreme wind pressure coefficients are investigated based on the very long wind tunnel data. The correlation of extreme pressures considering the randomness of the annual maximum mean wind speed is also addressed. Finally, the application of the correlation of extreme wind pressures on the damage estimation for the asphalt shingle roofing is discussed.

AB - A theoretical method, termed the mesoscale fiber-matrix discrete model (MFDM), has been developed that can be used for estimating the shear contribution of steel fibers and calculating shear strength of ultrahigh-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) beams. In the proposed model, an effective fiber distributed region (EDR) along the critical diagonal shear crack, where fibers are efficient at providing shear resistance, is defined. The total quantity of fibers within EDR is calculated by the EDR volume proportion of the beam based on a uniform distribution of steel fibers. Two concepts to determine the width of EDR are proposed: (1)&nbsp;probability theory and (2)&nbsp;the basis of the pullout load slip relationship. The bond strength between a single fiber and the matrix is determined by the probability method based on a uniform distribution of fibers. Combining the number of efficient fibers and the bond strength of a single fiber, the shear contribution of fibers is derived. The shear contribution of concrete is obtained using Rankine’s failure criteria and strain and stress distribution of compression zone while the shear contribution of stirrups is determined by the truss model. To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed model, an experimental program on ten simply supported UHPFRC beams was executed. Through comparison with test results, the proposed model shows good agreement with testing results.

AB - The yielding brace system (YBS) is a seismic-resistant concentrically braced frame system that provides a fully symmetric hysteretic response via flexural yielding of cast steel triangular yielding fingers of a specially designed yielding connector. The behavior of the system is first reviewed, and a detailed discussion of the limit states design of a YBS braced frame is presented. Results of two full-scale yielding connector prototype tests, conducted in a braced frame configuration, are then presented. The test specimens were subjected to several quasi-static and dynamic load cycles, up to axial brace deformations of 120&nbsp;mm (3.8% interstory drift). The proposed design limit states were validated through full-scale testing and the performance of a YBS yielding connector brace assembly in a typical braced frame with a bolted brace-to-gusset connection was demonstrated to be very similar to the performance of YBS yielding connectors tested in a purely axial configuration.

AB - Concrete-filled steel tube columns with solid steel core are prefabricated innovative composite columns that are especially designed to achieve high fire resistance, even with high slenderness ratios and load levels. These features make them architecturally and economically appealing for use in high-rise buildings. Conceptually, their exceptional structural fire behavior is attributed to a process of gradual load redistribution to the solid steel core during fire that is thermally protected by the concrete infill. In this paper the results of a series of four ISO fire tests with concrete-filled steel tube columns with solid steel core of three different cross-sectional types and two different end conditions are presented. This novel experimental database for this type of composite column (1)&nbsp;validates the concept of their structural fire behavior; and (2)&nbsp;shows that, without additional fire protection, extraordinary fire resistance of almost 180 min can be achieved with common slenderness and load ratios with respect to building practice.

AB - In the present study, a new fabrication method is proposed for concrete-filled hollow precast concrete columns (HPCC). In the proposed method, corrugated steel plates were used for the internal mold of the hollow core section to improve production efficiency and structural safety. To evaluate the constructability and structural performance, mock-up tests and cyclic loading tests were performed for four HPCC specimens and a conventional RC specimen. The test results showed that the overall behavior of the HPCC specimens was similar to that of the monolithic RC specimen, and the structural performances such as maximum load, initial stiffness, displacement ductility, and energy dissipation were comparable to or even higher than those of the RC specimen. The ultimate strength of the HPCC specimens agreed with the prediction by the current design code, which indicates that the proposed composite columns of precast concrete and cast-in-place concrete showed the full composite strength.

AB - This paper presents two analysis methods for the in-plane seismic response of steel multitiered braced frames (MT-BFs) with three or more tiers: (1)&nbsp;a substructuring technique; and (2)&nbsp;a stiffness analysis method. Both methods are consistent with the 2010 AISC Seismic Provisions and have been developed to estimate column flexural demands and tier drifts to prevent column instability and to mitigate concentration of tier drifts as well as premature brace failure under seismic loading. Both methods account for the progression of brace tension yielding along the frame height as observed in MT-BFs. The substructuring technique is simpler and is limited to regular frames, as it assumes a predefined yielding sequence. The stiffness analysis–based method is more rigorous and can predict the actual frame nonlinear response. It can be applied to both regular and irregular MT-BF configurations. The application of the methods is illustrated for two five-tiered special concentrically braced frame examples. Nonlinear response history analysis is performed to validate the proposed methods for the frames studied.

AB - Light-gauge metal sheeting is often used in steel building and bridge industries as concrete deck formwork. Besides providing support to the fresh concrete, the sheeting acts as a shear diaphragm and provides continuous lateral bracing to the top flanges of the beams to which they are attached. An adequate stability-bracing system must possess sufficient stiffness and strength to control deformations and brace forces. Strength requirements for shear diaphragms are currently not well established. A computational study was conducted to develop strength requirements for shear diaphragms bracing simply supported steel beams. Both end-fastener and sidelap-fastener connections were modeled in the study. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the stability-induced forces in sidelap fasteners. The effects of deck width and number of end and sidelap fasteners on brace forces were investigated. Expressions were developed to estimate the stability-induced brace forces in end-fastener and sidelap-fastener connections.

AB - This paper presents a study on force transfer around openings (FTAO) in cross-laminated timber (CLT) shear walls. To elucidate the load transfer mechanism in CLT walls, this study used finite-element models to study five different CLT shear wall configurations. The effect of uncertainty in the behavior of connectors in the wall over its force-deformation behavior and design transfer force was also studied. In a coupled-panel wall, the presence of an opening decreased the strength and stiffness of the wall and tie-rods were provided as reinforcement to limit the deformation between the panels in the wall and to improve its strength and stiffness. The models presented here provide a tool to determine the transfer force in a CLT shear wall for design of tie-rods and develop a better understanding of load distribution within the wall.

AB - The noncompact web-slenderness limit in current design specifications is based on an assumed value of the plate buckling coefficient for a web subjected to flexure that is between the values for fixed and simply-supported edge conditions. While the limit provided in current specifications is a good representation in many situations, there is evidence that the limit overestimates the magnitude of the restraint provided by smaller flanges. This paper shows that the ratio of the area of the compression flange to the area of the web in compression is a good indicator of the restraint provided to the bend-buckling of the web plate. The overestimation of the plate buckling coefficient can result in the classification of cross sections having relatively small flanges as noncompact web sections when their behavior is more akin to that of slender web sections. Slender web sections have a maximum possible flexural resistance, referred to as the plateau strength, less than the yield moment Myc, because of load shedding from the web. Furthermore, the St. Venant torsional stiffness contribution to the lateral torsional buckling resistance is neglected for these sections due to web distortional flexibility. This paper evaluates the appropriate noncompact web-slenderness limit via test simulation of a targeted set of short girder specimens in which the calculated resistance is governed by the plateau strength and proposes a modified equation to rectify the problem. The impact of this change on the prediction of a broad range of member limit states is illustrated via comparison to other test simulations and to experimental results.

AB - An algorithm of the wave method for structural health monitoring (SHM) is tested and calibrated using shake table experiment data of a full-scale, seven-story, reinforced-concrete building slice. The method is based on monitoring changes in the velocity of waves propagating vertically through the structure, identified by least-squares (LSQ) fit of beam models. The experiment was conducted by a team from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) on the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulations (NEES) outdoor shake table. Ambient noise, white noise, and earthquake response data for four progressive damage states were analyzed. The algorithm is tested for the first time on highly dispersive wave propagation, on a damaged structure, and on much shorter segments of ambient vibration data than used previously. The structure is modeled as a Timoshenko beam with large shear stiffness, and its compressional wave velocity, cL, is identified. The change in cL is measured for the different damage states and is compared with the change of the fundamental frequency of vibration, f1. The effectiveness of the method is discussed.

AB - This paper presents an experimental study investigating the effect of partial debonding of longitudinal reinforcement at the location of the plastic hinge on the performance of reinforced concrete columns in special moment-resisting frames designed for seismic regions as per standard guidelines. Partial debonding is investigated as a means of spreading locally induced deformations over larger rebar lengths, thereby preventing early rebar yielding and fracture and improving the seismic performance of the columns. The experimental program, which was conducted at the University of Colorado Boulder, included quasi-static cyclic testing of three nearly full-scale (∼1∶1.14 or ∼88%) cantilever columns with various debonded reinforcement lengths. The experimental findings showed that reinforcement debonding resulted in early onset of concrete cracking and delayed reinforcement yielding. Spreading of concrete damage decreased with the debonded length, not exceeding half of the plastic hinge length (as opposed to the full plastic hinge length for bonded reinforcement). Debonding alleviated strain localizations in the steel reinforcement, at least, for drift ratios below 2%. The peak strength and initial elastic stiffness decreased with the debonded length. Energy dissipation and equivalent viscous damping ratio increased with the debonded length for drift ratios below 2%, and decreased with the debonded length for drift ratios exceeding 3%. Self-centering improved with the debonded length.

AB - Concrete-filled stainless steel tubular (CFSST) columns have attracted increasing research interests in recent years; however, It seems that the behavior of this type of innovative column under cyclic loading has not been addressed sufficiently so far. This paper reports test results of 10 CFSST columns under constant axial load and cyclically increasing flexural loading. The main parameters varied in the experiments were axial load level, cross-sectional type, and concrete type. The influences of these parameters on strength, ductility, stiffness, and energy dissipation were investigated. It was found that CFSST columns exhibited excellent energy dissipation and ductility, even when the specimens were subjected to high axial loads. The hysteretic behavior of the tested CFSST columns was compared to that of their carbon steel composite counterparts reported in the literature. Several existing design codes were used to predict the ultimate strength and flexural stiffness of the test specimens, and some suggestions are proposed accordingly for designing CFSST columns.

AB - The 7.8-magnitude Nepal earthquake on April 25, 2015, caused more than 9,000 fatalities and tremendous damage to civil infrastructures. Some unique characteristics of this earthquake and its effects on a prototype unreinforced masonry (URM) building have been investigated in this paper. The ground motion has short period components in the period range of T&lt;0.5  s as well as long-period components in the period range of 4–6&nbsp;s. This characteristic is unique with respect to recorded ground motions in other parts of the world and with respect to the design response spectra in the Kathmandu region. Effects of this particular composition of frequency contents are discussed within the context of both elastic and inelastic response spectra. Common ground motion parameters for this earthquake have been investigated to compare the destructiveness of this earthquake to other historical earthquakes. In addition to this, acceleration spectrum intensity (ASI), which has been typically utilized for seismic evaluation of concrete dams, has been investigated to show unique characteristics of this earthquake. The long-period motion in the recorded time histories can be approximated by an analytical pulse model available in the literature. Frequency contents of this earthquake have also been investigated by using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) approach, which provides insight into the contributions of various frequency contents to the recorded ground motion. It is also demonstrated that, although the record motion has a long predominant period, it is capable of severely damaging stiff, short-period, unreinforced masonry structures with timber diaphragm because of the presence of short-period components in the ground motion.

AB - Based on the capacity models in the 2008 edition of the American Concrete Institute (ACI) Standard Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete, a more realistic limit state function is built for reinforced concrete columns with random eccentricity. Then, we discuss the applicability of the load and resistance factors in the code, which is mainly based on reliability calibrations with a fixed eccentricity criterion. Taking the wind-dominated combination as an example, representative cases are established by selecting typical values of four related design parameters. Using the load and resistance models in previous reliability calibration of the code, the probabilistic distribution of eccentricity and the statistics of column resistance are analyzed for each case. The analysis indicates that the possible eccentricity shows a scatter over a large range, and the probabilistic model of column resistance varies from case to case, which is largely different from the constant resistance model assumed in previous reliability calibration. With Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), the column reliability is calculated and obtained for different cases. The results show that the fixed eccentricity criterion underestimates the reliability differences among cases and overestimates the column reliability in some tension failure cases. To attain a robust design, an improved measure is recommended by selecting optimum wind load factors varying with cases. The new calibration results prove that the recommended measures can achieve the goal better.

AB - This paper presents the results of an experimental program in which eight one-third-scale steel-plate composite (SC) wall sections were tested in four-point bending to ultimate failure (tension faceplate rupture). All specimens had the same global dimensions (102×279×1626  mm) but varied design parameters: different faceplate thickness resulting in 3.5–5.6% flexural reinforcement and slenderness ratios from 17.9 to 29.0; steel faceplate strength ranged from 400 to 700&nbsp;MPa; and different tie-bar diameters and spacing resulted in shear reinforcement ratios between 0.37 and 1.23%. The experimental results include the elastic stiffness and yield moment, postyield behavior up to ultimate failure, fundamental moment-curvature behavior, complete load-displacement response, and deformation and curvature ductility for all eight specimens. Equations from existing design specifications for SC walls accurately estimated cracked-transformed (elastic) stiffness and the yield moment of the scaled wall sections. The ductility of the specimens is related directly to the faceplate material ductility and net section loss due to holes in the faceplates through which tie bars were installed.

AB - A Kalman filtering–based inverse method for identification of wind forces on supertall buildings is proposed. The new approach allows simultaneously estimating the wind loads and entire wind-induced responses of a supertall building using only a limited set of measurements. The effectiveness and good accuracy of the proposed algorithm are validated with experimental results. The wind loads acting on a supertall building are estimated based on the wind-induced responses determined from wind-tunnel testing. The stability of the proposed algorithm is evaluated. The effects of several key factors such as measurement noise, errors of structural modal parameters, and covariance matrix of noise on the identification accuracy are examined and discussed using the L-curve method. Finally, the identified wind loads on the supertall building based on field-measured displacements were compared with the wind-tunnel testing results to further verify the effectiveness of the inverse technique.
