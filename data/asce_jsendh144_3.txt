AB - Earthquake-induced damage to the built infrastructure can generate enormous societal impact, ranging from displacement of individual families and businesses to disruption of entire economic sectors and public services. Consequently, engineers play a critical role in mitigating these cascading, multiscale earthquake impacts. A significant component in this effort involves designing buildings and other structures to avoid the types of damage that can lead to loss of functionality and downtime after an earthquake. Toward this end, this paper describes the state of the art in assessing earthquake-induced loss of functionality in individual buildings. More specifically, it details how earthquake-induced loss of functionality within the built infrastructure can generate multiscale impacts that cascade through a community across space and time. It also compiles from various sources a consistent hierarchy of definitions for building functionality, and examines the myriad combinations of events and failures that can impact it, culminating with the development of functionality-restoration curves that graphically depict how the availability of various building components and systems affect recovery. The paper then reviews, both recently developed analytical models for evaluating loss of functionality in individual buildings and also current practice for designing buildings to maintain or regain functionality after earthquakes. Lastly, the paper identifies several critical gaps in knowledge and areas of future research that need to be addressed in order for the engineering profession to, both design buildings to quickly regain functionality after a major earthquake and also more effectively communicate risk with community stakeholders (e.g.,&nbsp;building owners, emergency managers, and city planners).

AB - The posttensioning anchorage system of prestressed concrete consists of an anchorage device and lateral reinforcements for the enhancement of the concrete surrounding the anchorage device. In this paper, experimental and analytical studies were conducted in order to develop an efficient anchorage device and to design an equation of the bearing strength in the posttensioning anchorage zone. Eighteen load transfer specimens were tested, and the results were compared with the AASHTO and National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) equations to investigate how they estimated the ultimate resisting capacity of the anchorage zone. The finite-element model for the numerical analyses was verified by comparison with the test results. Three-dimensional nonlinear analyses were carried out for the three design variables: (1)&nbsp;the location, (2)&nbsp;the length, and (3)&nbsp;the number of ribs used to evaluate the effect of each variable on the bearing strength. The best efficiency of the anchorage device was shown when a rib was placed at the opposite end of the bearing plate or when two ribs were evenly placed over the anchorage device. From the results of the parametric studies, the modified bearing capacity equation that implied the effect of additional transverse ribs was suggested.

AB - This paper presents a probabilistic study using the fragility function method for the performance assessment of two 1/6-scale, single-bay, three- and eight-story steel moment-resisting frame structures representing rigid and flexible framed structures, respectively. Considering the impact of the uncertainties in seismic loading and response of structures, the adopted fragility methodology is believed to provide a realistic and robust assessment of seismic performance and vulnerability of the structures. Fragility curves were developed by considering appropriate performance levels and using the response data from nonlinear time-history analyses of the structures in longitudinal and transverse directions with respective moment and shear connections. Results of the fragility analysis showed that inclusion of panel zone reinforcement in numerical simulation of the framed structures lowers the seismic vulnerability and probability of damage to the structures. The relatively lower seismic performances of the structures in the transverse direction with shear connections and lower lateral stiffness were demonstrated as well. Moreover, the eight-story structure was found to be more vulnerable to seismic loading and severe damages compared to the three-story structure. The adopted fragility method can serve as an effective tool for assessing the performance and safety levels of structures, and in decision making as well as financing for seismic protection.

AB - A probabilistic framework is presented for the development of physics and simulation-based parametrized tsunami fragility functions for structures accounting for structural member failures. The proposed framework is general and accounts for material and geometric sources of uncertainty and makes use of nonlinear finite-element structural models and the first-order second-moment (FOSM) reliability method. The application of the framework is illustrated with the development of parametrized fragility functions for an example reinforced concrete moment frame building designed to recent United States codes. Results indicate that explicit consideration of structural member failures is of paramount importance because the fragility functions based on global failure criteria that do not account for member failures tend to overpredict damage state capacities. Among the several sources of uncertainty considered, breakaway openings in the building are the dominant contributor to the uncertainty in the structural capacity. In addition, the estimation efficiency of several scalar and vector-valued intensity measures as predictors of structural damage is evaluated using the logistic regression method. The intensity measures considered consist of inundation depth, flow velocity, specific momentum flux, kinematic moment of specific momentum flux, and their interactions. The estimation efficiency of vector-valued intensity measures is found to be higher than that of scalar intensity measures. Among the scalar intensity measures analyzed, those that combine information of inundation depth and flow velocity are identified to be the most efficient predictors of structural damage, and therefore are considered to be the preferred measures to characterize the intensity of tsunami hazards for practical applications.

AB - Displacement-controlled finite-element analyses are typically employed to simulate the nonlinear static response of structural systems where a loss of load carrying capacity due to localized material failure and/or geometric nonlinearity is expected. To utilize applications such as reliability, optimization, and system identification for structural systems where the peak load capacity is a random variable or where the performance function is defined in terms of the applied load, accurate and efficient gradients of the displacement-controlled response are required. The direct differentiation method (DDM) is applied to the displacement control method in order to compute response sensitivity with respect to the applied load, which is treated as a variable within each pseudotime step. The resulting sensitivity gives the change in structural load carrying capacity with respect to changes in uncertain parameters. To verify the derived sensitivity equations, comparisons between the DDM and the finite-difference method (FDM) are performed through standalone sensitivity analyses of structural systems with material and geometric nonlinearity. Reliability analyses of a steel frame show the importance measures obtained when the performance function is defined in terms of the structural resistance to applied loads in a displacement-controlled analysis are similar to those obtained in a load-controlled analysis where the performance function is defined in terms of the structural displacements.

AB - This paper presents a bolted steel plate connection to join steel members at a range of angles with the capability of adjusting in situ to accommodate additional angles or tolerances through cold bending. The connection features plates that are prebent (cold bent via a press brake) to defined angles, and then further cold bent during field installation (by bolt tightening) until turn-of-nut criteria are met. This approach uses a small number of unique components to facilitate prefabrication and rapid erection. Geometric studies were performed to select connection parameters for greatest adaptability to manufacturing and erection tolerances and versatility of member dimensions. A total of 13 scenarios were tested under field installation conditions to investigate the effect of the (1)&nbsp;bolt-tightening procedure, (2)&nbsp;amount and direction of field bending, and (3)&nbsp;plate angle on surface strains. Strains were measured using digital image correlation—an optical technique that captures full-field data. This paper presents a novel approach for bolted steel connections, measures the impact of field installation on surface strains, and makes implementation and design recommendations.

AB - Fire-induced spalling is one of the concerns with the use of high-strength concrete (HSC) in structural applications. Some recent studies have recommended addition of polypropylene and/or steel fibers to overcome such spalling. This paper presents results from fire resistance tests on the comparative fire performance of HSC columns with and without fibers. Four reinforced concrete (RC) columns made of HSC with plain (no fibers), polypropylene, steel, and hybrid fibers, as well as one RC column made of conventional normal-strength concrete (NSC), were tested under different fire conditions. Data from these tests are utilized to evaluate comparative fire behavior of RC columns made of plain and fiber-reinforced HSC. In addition, an analytical study is carried out to evaluate relative changes in porosity and temperature-induced pore pressure in NSC and HSC, and its effect on spalling behavior and fire resistance of HSC columns. Results from fire resistance experiments and numerical studies show that hybrid-fiber-reinforced HSC columns exhibit better fire performance compared to polypropylene- or steel-fiber-reinforced or plain HSC columns.

AB - The cost-effective design of seismic protective devices considering multiple criteria related to their lifecycle performance is examined, focusing on applications to fluid viscous dampers. The adopted framework is based on nonlinear time-history analysis for describing structural behavior, an assembly-based vulnerability approach for quantifying earthquake losses, and on characterization of the earthquake hazard through stochastic ground motion modeling. The probabilistic (lifecycle) performance is quantified through the expected value of some properly defined risk consequences measured over the space of the uncertain parameters (i.e.,&nbsp;random variables) for the structural system and seismic hazard. The main design objective considered is the mean total lifecycle cost, composed of the upfront protective device cost and the present value of future earthquake losses. For incorporating risk-aversion attitudes in the decision-making process, an additional objective is examined, corresponding to consequences (repair cost in the example considered in this study) with a specific small-exceedance probability over the lifetime of the structure. This explicitly accounts for low-likelihood but large-consequence seismic events and ultimately leads to a multicriteria design problem. To support the use of complex numerical and probability models, a computational framework relying on kriging surrogate modeling is adopted for performing the resultant multiobjective optimization. The surrogate model is formulated in the so-called augmented input space, composed of both the uncertain model parameters and the design variables (controllable device parameters), and therefore is used to simultaneously support both the uncertainty propagation (calculation of risk integrals for the lifecycle performance) and the design optimization. As an illustrative example, the retrofitting of a three-story building with nonlinear fluid viscous dampers is examined.

AB - This research focuses on a new type of buckling-restrained brace (BRB) with replaceable steel angle fuses. The proposed BRB offers ease of postearthquake examination of fuse damage, convenient and prompt replacement of damaged fuses, and reuse of the buckling restraining elements. To investigate seismic behavior of the proposed BRB, seven brace specimens are tested. The test parameters varied in these specimens include fuse design, fuse material, debonding material, and loading protocol. Test results show that the proposed BRB can exhibit stable hysteretic behavior up to fairly high fuse strain levels. Failure modes of the specimens are found to be ruptures of the angle fuses, as expected. The compression strength adjustment factors and the cumulative plastic deformations of the specimens are found to satisfy the requirements specified by the current U.S. seismic design provisions for structural steel buildings. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that specimens repaired through fuse replacement remain satisfactory in following tests. Furthermore, rupture failures of the proposed BRB can be captured by the modified Park–Ang damage measure.

AB - This study proposes a model to predict bond stress-slip behavior by conducting tests on RC members that experience splitting bond failure when subject to cyclic loading such as seismic loads. The specimens had a shear span-to-depth ratio of 1.8, and splitting bond failure was induced by applying antisymmetric bending moment. The main variable of the experiment was the confinement of the longitudinal reinforcement; high-strength transverse reinforcement was used in the specimens to evaluate the bond performance of the RC members in relation to the yield strength of the transverse reinforcement. Based on the experimental results, the confinement conditions of the longitudinal reinforcement and the yield strength of the transverse reinforcement were selected as main variables in the prediction model for bond stress-slip behavior. The proposed model also considered changes in bond stiffness and bond deterioration caused by loading history. The effectiveness of the proposed model was evaluated through a comparison of the analytical results and experimental results. The model provided highly precise predictions of the bond stress-slip behavior of specimens.

AB - Reinforced concrete (RC) structures are designed in such a way that flexural yielding precedes bond failure, in order to ensure the ductile behavior of members. When subject to cyclic loading including seismic loads, brittle bond failure may occur due to bond deterioration at the interface between concrete and longitudinal reinforcement. To prevent the brittle failure of RC members in which flexural yielding occurs first, this study proposes a model to predict the bond stress-slip relationship and evaluate the ductility of members based on the test results of RC members that experience bond failure after flexural yielding. The variables of the proposed model are lateral loading patterns, confinement conditions of longitudinal reinforcement, and yield strength of lateral confining reinforcement. The reliability of the proposed model was verified by comparing the test results for RC members to the analytical results. The proposed model provided outstanding predictions for the bond stress-slip relationship and ductility of RC members.

AB - Fracture is an important mode of failure in steel structures, whereas traditional fracture mechanics is difficult to apply in predicting ductile fracture in the presence of large-scale yielding or in flaw-free geometries. This study offers a means for numerical simulation of ductile fractures of constructional steels. Experimental investigations on the conventional smooth round bar specimens are carried out with special focus on the postnecking strain hardening and fracture properties, and a new experimental procedure is proposed to explicitly obtain the yield-to-fracture true stress–strain relationship, as well as the fracture strain and corresponding stress triaxiality. A fracture criterion is proposed by means of finite-element unit cell–based micromechanical studies, in which the most significant microscopic features of fracture including both void growth and coalescence are considered. To calibrate and validate the proposed fracture criterion, tests of notched round bar specimens representing high stress triaxiality are also carried out. The numerical method for material fracture simulation in implicit time integration analyses is addressed, and matters needing attention when using such a method are discussed, including the countermeasures of convergence difficulties caused by material softening and determination of mesh sizes.

AB - An experimental campaign consisting of nine pressure-controlled quasi-static airbag tests on unreinforced masonry (URM) walls and accompanying material testing was completed to investigate methods for seismic retrofit of out-of-plane loaded cavity walls. Three control walls were tested to serve as a baseline for wall strength comparisons: (1)&nbsp;a double-leaf unstrengthened cavity wall; (2)&nbsp;a cavity wall with improved cavity connections; and (3)&nbsp;a single-leaf wall strengthened using a near-surface-mounted (NSM) fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) strip. The experimental program was concluded by six tests that were conducted on walls strengthened using a NSM FRP strip and having cavity connections in the form of either standard bent metal ties, proprietary helical anchors, or industrial foam. The tests were designed to measure the ability of the different cavity connections to maintain the cavity gap until a ductile wall failure mechanism forms by FRP debonding. Three of the walls were previously damaged by testing in either unstrengthened or FRP-strengthened conditions. These tests were intended to study FRP retrofit effectiveness of precracked walls or the relative ability of different types of cavity connections to resist forces until a global FRP debonding occurs. For each of the six cavity connection configurations, the FRP-strengthening technique was shown to significantly improve the wall strength. The minimum strength increase was 282% compared with that of the control cavity wall. The compiled data are presented followed by general discussions on the design of seismic retrofit for cavity walls.

AB - Rocking core-moment frame (RCMF) combinations are structural assemblies that are capable of collapse prevention, recentering, avoiding soft story failure, and large residual deformation. Although several such systems have been proposed, few studies have quantified RCMFs behavior under lateral loadings. This paper proposes closed-form solutions for the rapid study of RCMFs subjected to three typical lateral load patterns using a continuum method of analysis. An extensive parametric study examines the effects of base fixity, relative frame-to-core stiffness, and type of loading profile. Independent computer analyses verify the validity and accuracy of the proposed formulas. The proposed formulas are applicable to linear-static analysis and preliminary design of low-rise to mid-rise RCMFs with relatively uniform properties over the height.

AB - Detailed seismic provisions for concentrically braced frames have evolved continuously since 1988. Thus, vintage-era braced frames, especially those designed prior to 1988, may be prone to a number of significant deficiencies. These deficiencies include interdependent failures at the braces, connections, and beams, making them difficult to predict without system-level tests. An experimental study was undertaken to evaluate current retrofit provisions’ ability to predict the seismic response of pre-1988 existing braced frames. A nearly full-scale test specimen—representative of a 1985 chevron braced frame—was subjected to cyclic lateral loading. The specimen was subsequently upgraded with concrete-filled braces and retested. Test results demonstrate that pre-1988 braced frames are highly susceptible to weak-story behavior and local failure modes. Numerical models using standard nonlinear static methods predicted some, but not all, of these failures. Accordingly, recommendations to improve the efficacy of these numerical models are presented.

AB - This paper presents the results of a multiphase research program aimed at investigating the out-of-plane stability of slender reinforced masonry shear walls (RMSWs) under in-plane reversed-cyclic loading. The objective of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of the out-of-plane stability provisions specified in the Canadian masonry design standard, which are currently in the form of height-to-thickness (h/t) limits. For the second phase of the program, which is presented in this paper, the evaluation was carried out by experimental testing of five slender full-scale RMSW specimens with varying h/t and height-to-length aspect ratios, reinforcement ratio, detailing, and applied axial precompression stress level. The tests were conducted by applying a displacement-controlled loading protocol at the top of each specimen, without restraining the in-plane rotational degree of freedom, until the lateral load-carrying capacity of the specimen was reduced to 60% of its peak capacity. Detailed qualitative and quantitative test results are summarized in this paper. In addition, a discussion regarding key factors found to affect the out-of-plane stability of RMSWs is presented. Preliminary findings suggest that the current Canadian masonry design standard h/t limits may be potentially conservative if used alone to assess the out-of-plane stability of RMSWs.

AB - A full-scale five-story reinforced concrete building specimen, outfitted with a variety of nonstructural components and systems (NCSs), was built and tested on the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation at the University of California, San Diego (NEES–UCSD) large outdoor shake table in the period March 2011–June 2012. The building specimen was subjected to a sequence of dynamic tests including scaled and unscaled earthquake motions. A detailed three-dimensional nonlinear finite-element (FE) model of the structure was developed and used for pretest response simulations to predict the seismic response of the test specimen and for decision support in defining the seismic test protocol and selecting the instrumentation layout for both the structure and NCSs. This paper introduces the building specimen and the shake table test protocol and describes the techniques used for the nonlinear FE modeling and response simulation. Utilized as blind prediction, the pretest simulation results at different scales (global structural level and local member/section/fiber levels) are compared with their experimental counterparts for seismic input (base excitation) of increasing intensity from serviceability to design levels. The predictive capabilities of the used FE modeling techniques are evaluated and possible sources of discrepancies between the FE predictions and experimental measurements are investigated and discussed.

AB - A three-dimensional (3D) noncontact laser-scanning method to quantify the deviations in cold-formed steel (CFS) channel sections (plain and lipped) is presented. The methodologies to segregate the different categories of imperfections from the deviations in the geometry of CFS member are also presented. A total of 24 different C-sections (minimum of six samples in each section) with varying cross-sectional parameters totaling 188 specimens were studied. The nature of imperfections in the CFS members was found to correlate with geometric properties such as slenderness ratios, torsional constant, and plate slenderness. The bow and camber imperfection (global out-of-straightness) in the members is presented with respect to the minor and major axis slenderness ratios. A new combined global and cross-sectional parameter (J/L) is introduced against the deviation caused by twisting of the CFS member. To predict the imperfection magnitudes based on their geometrical properties, a new set of expressions are suggested.

AB - Current methods for designing steel structures, such as load and resistance factor design (LRFD) are based on safety checks of individual members derived from elastic analysis. The next generation of steel design methods will move from member-based to system-based design. Recent advances in nonlinear structural analysis make it possible to design a steel frame as a system rather than as a set of independent components, and several steel design specifications worldwide have incorporated provisions for designing for overall system behavior. However, requirements for minimum system reliability that have been implemented in such design-by-inelastic analysis methods rely on existing resistance factors originally developed from member reliability considerations. This paper examines the system reliabilities of a number of simple yet representative structures, including a continuous beam, a portal frame that fails from elastic instability, and three related frames with various load redistribution capacities. The paper provides an overview of the strengths and system reliabilities of these structures when designed either by the second-order inelastic method or by LRFD in AISC 360-10, and discusses the reliability implications of these alternative approaches to steel structure design.

AB - The propagation of uncertainty in seismic response analysis is the mechanism through which ground motion (GM) uncertainty and structural parameter (SP) uncertainty contribute to response variability, and is critical for accurately quantifying seismic risk in performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE). Response uncertainty in existing PBEE analyses is estimated either through statistical variance combination approaches or through computationally intensive time history simulations. In general, experimental exploration of the uncertainty propagation is cost prohibitive and impractical. In this paper, a series of shake table tests are conducted to generate statistical seismic response data of 12 nominally identical simple specimens subjected to a suite of 7 earthquakes at different seismic intensity levels. The test data are analyzed in order to decouple the contributions of GM uncertainty and structural parameter uncertainty on response uncertainty with different intensity levels and verifying several basic characteristics about uncertainty propagation. In addition, the accuracy of the square root sum of squares (SRSS), which is a simplified method used to combine different uncertainty sources to calculate the total response uncertainty, is evaluated through comparison with test data.
