AB - In timber structures resisting earthquakes, slender steel fasteners are traditionally employed to provide ductility in the joints. However, this is associated with pinched hysteresis loops when timber fibers are irreversibly crushed during loading cycles. A pinching-free connector (PFC) was developed to address this issue. In the PFC, crushing-induced slack is effectively absorbed through a ratcheting mechanism. Quasistatic cyclic tests verified that the PFC eliminated pinching. A stocky-fastener configuration of the PFC demonstrated improved reloading stiffness and predictability of resistance under Mode 1 behavior. This enables a smaller overstrength factor of 1.45 compared to 1.6 for conventional connections. Additional ground motion simulations indicate that the PFC reduces peak displacements by 53% relative to conventional connections. As a ratcheting connector, the PFC accumulates crushing deformation on every nonlinear cycle, whether it is small or large in amplitude. Further analyses indicate that the cumulative deformation demand can be estimated at three times the peak connector deformation. With the PFC, few stocky fasteners may be a possible alternative to conventional timber connections requiring many slender fasteners for seismic applications.

AB - Hakka Tulou, a traditional form of Chinese building made of rammed earth and a timber frame, is characterized by its remarkable geometries, excellent thermal comfort, sustainability, and cultural value. The joints between rammed-earth walls and timber floor beams are critical structural elements and require an in-depth understanding of the load-bearing capacity for Hakka Tulou. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first study that investigates the bond–slip mechanism between timber beams and rammed earth. Eight pull-out tests were conducted on rammed earth–timber (RET) joints, in which the influence of compressive load, embedment length, and surface roughness was systematically studied. RET joints were analyzed based on the elastic solid-to-solid and pile-to-soil behaviors. The experimental results show that the bond–slip behavior could mainly be attributed to the friction, which depended on the normal stress and matric suction of unsaturated compacted earth. The test results were satisfactorily explained by geotechnical theories. Given the initial strength resulting from compaction and mobilized friction due to compression, a bond–slip model for rammed-earth structures was proposed. The parameters for the elastic zone were suggested for use in structural design. Rammed-earth buildings should be analyzed based on the principles of unsaturated soil mechanics, rather than elastic solid mechanics, even though rammed earth and underground soil are under fundamentally different conditions. The proposed design method for earth–timber joints could be applied to analyze Hakka Tulou or other similar earth buildings.

AB - This paper investigated the potential applicability of the specification equation for the shear pull-out strength of a power-actuated fastener (PAF) connection to nail connections between steel sheets thinner than 2.9&nbsp;mm. The tested G300, G450, and G550 specimens had thicknesses ranging from 0.6 to 2.4&nbsp;mm, connected with 2.5- or 3.6-mm helically knurled nails. The pull-out strength is a function not only of the thickness of the member not in contact with the fastener head, but also of the other member’s thickness. The member thicknesses have greater influence than the nail diameter on the pull-out strength, contrary to the design equation. Based on the test results of 93 shear nailed connections failing in pull-out, the paper proposes a design equation that is applicable to connections using helically knurled nails of steel sheets thinner than 2.9&nbsp;mm. A group effect factor of 0.75 is suggested for serial nail connections based on the test results of 19 multiple nail connections. A resistance factor of 0.55 is recommended for use with the proposed equation for determining the pull-out strength of shear nailed connections in thin steel sheets. An additional finding is that the current design equation for the bearing and tilting strength of a PAF connection is applicable to connections in which the member not in contact with the fastener head is much thinner than the specification minimum of 3.2&nbsp;mm, and in which the fastener diameter is smaller than the specification minimum of 3.7&nbsp;mm.

AB - With the exception of older dwellings built on cripple walls, wood-frame single-family houses in California have shown adequate levels of safety against collapse in previous earthquakes. However, damage to chimneys and structural walls includes widespread types of damage that have resulted in houses being posted with yellow or red tags, restricting their postearthquake occupancy. By using analytical models, we develop fragility curves, sometimes also referred to as fragility functions, for estimating the probability of damage to masonry chimneys and severe damage to shear walls in wood-frame single-family houses as a function of the number of stories of the house, the year the chimney was built, and the ground motion intensity. Fragility curves are provided as a function of two different ground motion intensity measures: the 5%-damped average spectral pseudoacceleration at a period of 0.16&nbsp;s, and the peak ground acceleration. The proposed fragility curves are used within a fully probabilistic methodology for estimating the number of wood-frame single-family houses with chimney and wall damage in Napa, California, due to the 2014 South Napa earthquake. Results are compared to estimates computed using three previously proposed methodologies and with empirical data collected after the earthquake. The proposed fragility curves and methodology lead to estimations of the number of houses with chimney and wall damage that are between 2 and 10 times less biased than those computed using previous damage estimation procedures.

AB - This study presents a first attempt toward the rational design of bamboo multiculm axial members with dowel-type connections. Specifically, it implements an original combination of grading, use of multiple culms, and capacity design principles to manage the natural variability of bamboo culms and establish a reliable ductile failure. In this context, the study also calibrates the pertinent overstrength factors needed for achieving capacity-based design. The proposed axial members display high ductility and predictability owing to dowel yielding before the other components, i.e.,&nbsp;the steel gusset plates and the bamboo culms fail. Furthermore, arranging bolts along two perpendicular planes of the circular cross-section of bamboo culms increases efficiency and offers notable gains in strength over a single plane bolt configuration. The characteristic values of average material/geometric properties of multiculm members estimated from single-culm material tests can predict the experimental 5th percentile yielding of dowel connections with accuracy. Overall, the proposed approach results in reliable multiculm bamboo axial members and shows promise toward a rational engineered design of bamboo structures.

AB - Recent research on structural health monitoring has shown the applicability of Kalman filtering for fusion of models and data of dynamic systems. In this study, the augmented Kalman filter (AKF) is combined with a substructuring approach for the estimation of strain time histories at unmeasured locations of a rollercoaster connection, with the purpose of predicting remaining fatigue life. The AKF allows for response estimation in the absence of direct measurements of operational loads and in the presence of noisy measurements at limited locations of the instrumented system. The proposed research implements for the first time the AKF and a substructure with exclusively in-service strain measurements from a full-scale structure. Given that uniaxial fatigue life assessment methods often prove insufficient for large in-service structures with complex geometry and subjected to multiaxial nonproportional loadings, the critical plane method is here employed for estimation of fatigue life. The applicability of a substructuring approach combined with strain estimates from the AKF is demonstrated and evaluated with operational strain measurements obtained from an in-service rollercoaster support structure. It is shown that the proposed methodology and fine-tuning of the AKF parameters result in a close match of predicted and measured strains.

AB - A lumped parameter model for liquid sloshing in a rigid circular cylindrical tank with multiple rigid baffles under horizontal excitation is developed to represent continuous fluid. The subdomain method for liquid sloshing is implemented to divide the fluid domain into simple subdomains with continuous boundary conditions. The exact results of the convective velocity potential are obtained based on the continuity condition of pressure and velocity at the interfaces of liquid subdomains. By generating the same shear and moment as analytical solutions, an equivalent lumped parameter model with masses and springs is identified. The formulations of the lumped parameters in the model are analytically derived, including the convective and impulsive masses as well as their locations connected to the wall. Comparisons between the present results and available solutions confirm the feasibility and validity of the model. Detailed sloshing responses of liquid in the tank with multiple baffles are analyzed with regard to the dimensionless liquid heights, baffle positions, and sizes, respectively. The lumped parameter model can be simply assembled to make the dynamic analysis of complex fluid-structure systems with acceptable precision and a small amount of calculation.

AB - In this study, shearing tests on connections and bending tests on prefabricated timber–concrete composite (PTCC) beams were performed to evaluate the feasibility of using crossed inclined coach screw connections for PTCC structures. For comparison, tests on traditional timber–concrete composite (TCC) structures using this connection type were also conducted. The test results showed that crossed inclined coach screw connections exhibited improved shear and ductility properties. The investigated PTCC and TCC beams shared similar flexural properties and showed nonlinear bending performance owing to the nonlinear slip behavior of the connections. Hence, on the basis of the reduced rigidity method, a nonlinear semianalytical model considering the nonlinear slip behavior of the connection for the composite beams was developed. The analytical results showed that the interfacial frictional force acting during the tests significantly influenced the prediction of the slip and deflection of the composite beams.

AB - The performance of seismic braced frames can become compromised due to premature local buckling–induced fracture of the hollow structural section (HSS) steel braces. A strategy to delay the fracture of the braces is to postpone local buckling by filling HSS braces. Two experimental campaigns were undertaken to assess the performance of circular hollow section (CHS) braces under representative seismic loading when filled with a lightweight, pourable, expanding polyurethane foam. To determine the influence of the foam infill, 12 brace members were tested under reverse cyclic loading. In general, the foam infill was able to delay the initiation of local buckling in the plastic hinge region, consequently leading to improvements in cyclic ductility. Reduced strain values within the plastic hinge region of the filled braces compared with those of the empty braces further highlighted the beneficial influence of the foam infill. Overall, the test results suggested that the diameter-to-thickness ductility limits for CHS members in the current seismic design provisions can be relaxed with the inclusion of the polyurethane foam as infill.

AB - The debris field of earthquake-induced building collapse can block or reduce the capacity of adjacent sidewalks and roads, hinder emergency and evacuation operations, and therefore adversely influence the seismic resilience of a community. To consider the influence that earthquake-induced building collapse can have on mobility after an earthquake, the seismic debris field generated from the collapse of prototype reinforced-concrete (RC) moment resisting frame buildings with different heights is characterized using a validated applied element method (AEM) computational model. A deep neural network (DNN) is used to classify the mode of collapse of the prototype buildings based on a set of input parameters related to the properties of the applied ground motion record and the building height. The DNN is able to predict the collapse mode of the studied prototype building with an accuracy of 92% and 82% for the training and test datasets, respectively. The extent of the debris field around the collapsed buildings is then characterized probabilistically. It is shown that the extent of the debris field does not depend on the design code used to proportion the buildings. Based on the simulation results, an expression that captures the extent of the debris field as a function of building height is developed.

AB - This research investigates the shear resistance of steel angle connectors welded to the webs of U-shaped steel–concrete composite girders. First, push-out tests were conducted on the experimental specimens in which the design parameters included the thickness of the angles, the concrete compressive strength, and whether or not foam blocks were attached to the ends of the angles. The test results showed that the slip capacities of the steel angle connectors exceeded 6&nbsp;mm, for which the steel angle connectors can be categorized as a ductile shear connector. Finite-element (FE) models were then developed for each specimen. After the FE models were validated by the test results of the experimental specimens, the influences of different design parameters on the shear resistance of the angle connectors were investigated by parametric analyses. Further, based on the results from the parametric analyses, an empirical design model was developed and found to provide acceptable predictions for the shear resistance of the angle connector.

AB - An experimental and analytical study on rotational behavior of glulam beam-column moment connections with self-drilling dowels (SDDs) is conducted. Connection properties including strength, stiffness, ductility, and energy dissipation were experimentally evaluated by testing seven full-scale connection specimens with and without self-tapping screw (STS) reinforcement along timber perpendicular to grain. All the connections showed high initial stiffness and high moment capacity when compared with the test results of bolted connections reported in the literature. The unreinforced connections had relatively low ductility due to timber splitting despite the increased fastener edge distance. The STS reinforcement effectively reduced the timber splitting tendency and encouraged the yielding of more SDDs, leading to slightly increased moment capacity, but significantly improved ductility. A modified analytical model (MAM) is then proposed to predict strength and rotation of the SDD moment connections based on force and moment equilibrium of the glulam members. Improved prediction accuracy is achieved for the SDD moment connections when compared with the past analytical methods.

AB - The commentary to the North American cold-formed steel specification recommends physical testing to determine the performance of a bolted connection where the plies are not in contact with each other. This paper presents the laboratory test results of 120 such specimens with sheet thicknesses ranging from 0.55 to 3.0&nbsp;mm, bolted with 10-, 12-, or 16-mm bolts. Finite-element analyses support the experimental finding that the bearing failure of an unconfined bolted connection is not associated with shear fracture but with crimpling of the critical ply. The bearing capacity varies with the square root of the bolt diameter and nonlinearly with the sheet thickness. Dimensionally consistent and continuous design equations are derived and verified against the results of the laboratory tests and finite-element analyses, the latter supplementing the former with configurations involving 8-mm bolts. The derived relationships between the bearing capacity and the sheet thickness and bolt diameter are also verified against 18 independent test results involving bolted connections through square hollow sections. The presented equation is significantly simpler but more accurate than those proposed in the literature for such connections. A resistance factor of 0.70 is recommended for use with the proposed design equations for determining the bearing capacities of unconfined bolted connections.

AB - In performance-based earthquake engineering framework, seismic fragility functions play a fundamental role for quantifying the seismic resilience. There are three main approaches for performing the seismic fragility analysis: cloud analysis, incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), and multiple strip analysis (MSA). These approaches require different levels of computational efforts and yield different levels of accuracy on fragility curve estimates, leading to different predictions of seismic resilience. This paper presents an efficient method for converting fragility curves from the cloud to IDA and MSA and from IDA to MSA toward an efficient and high-fidelity resilience assessment. The proposed method requires two fragility points to obtain the fragility median and dispersion parameters that yield converted fragility curves agreeing with the target fragility curves. This method and associated resilience assessment are demonstrated through two case studies, one a typical two-span highway bridge in firm ground under longitudinal seismic excitations and the other an extended pile-shaft-supported bridge in liquefaction-induced laterally spreading ground under transverse seismic excitations. The results show that the converted fragility curves coincide very well with the target fragility curves. An efficient and high-fidelity resilience assessment can be achieved leveraging the proposed method. For easy implementation, codes of the proposed method are available online.

AB - This research presents the development of a mass timber buckling restrained brace (T-BRB) that combines a low yield strength steel core with a mass timber casing to create a new ductile fuse. The T-BRB is an essential element of a mass timber buckling restrained braced frame (BRBF), which is a promising mass timber wood lateral force–resisting system. Critical elements of T-BRB design that are important for good performance include casing stiffness, casing material, number and spacing of bolts, timber spacer and casing gap, steel core yield strength, and friction between steel core and casing interface. Compressive tests on engineered wood blocks using glued laminated timber, laminated veneer lumber, parallel strand lumber, and mass plywood panel (MPP) were conducted to determine elastic stiffness, maximum load, and ultimate displacement. MPP loaded parallel to the wide face of laminations (X-direction) outperformed other materials with respect to high elastic stiffness, which is an important property of the casing because it controls buckling of the steel core. Six 3.66&nbsp;m (12&nbsp;ft)–long T-BRBs with a targeted yield strength of 274&nbsp;kN (61.5&nbsp;kip) were tested utilizing three T-BRB casing designs with varying MPP lamination layups. A 3.9% strain was achieved under a strain-based loading protocol. For a fatigue-based loading protocol, after two cycles at 2.0% strain, more than 26 additional cycles at 1.5% strain were attained. The hysteresis curves for all six T-BRBs remained stable throughout the tests and the cumulative inelastic deformation exceeded two times the value required by the standard.

AB - Complex triaxial stress states are present in many reinforced concrete structures. These structures are often analyzed using simple hand calculations based on methods designed for plane structures. However, this can result in designs that are inefficient and excessive in material usage. This paper introduces finite-element limit analysis (FELA) for modeling of reinforced concrete structures, with separate modeling of concrete and reinforcement in a so far unseen scale. The method provides results for the capacity as well as the stress state and failure mechanism in the ultimate limit state. The FELA framework uses solid elements together with the modified Mohr-Coulomb and von Mises yield criteria. The framework uses a computationally inexpensive tetrahedral FELA element, which makes it possible to model rebar details in three dimensions (3D) with adequate discretization. The framework is demonstrated in two examples, one for verification and one showing the practical use of the framework by analyzing a tension connection with overlapping U-bars. The numerical results are compared with the failure mechanism and capacity from experiments.

AB - In this work, a 10-story uncoupled (10S-U) hybrid seismic force resisting system, consisting of cross-laminated timber (CLT) walls and reinforced concrete (RC) beams, is considered. Required design ductility factor Rd, in congruence with the National Building Code of Canada, was developed using FEMA P695 collapse risk procedure. Two trial Rd factors, Rd=2 and Rd=3, were first used to design the hybrid building for seismicity of Vancouver, BC, and 3D numerical models were developed in Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) finite element framework. The energy dissipation of the structural system was enhanced using buckling restraining brace hold-downs and energy dissipator connection between the panels. The rocking response mechanism governed and, as a result, the cyclic pushover results show recentering capability. A suitable set of 30 ground motion records that reflect the seismic hazard of Vancouver, British Columbia, was selected in congruence with the 2015 National Building Code of Canada (NBC). Using incremental dynamic analysis, the collapse risk and collapse margin ratios were obtained to check the suitability of the two proposed Rd factors. The Rd=2 factor was shown to be acceptable for the 10S-U structural system.

AB - The extreme wind speed estimation method, which is critical for designing wind load calculation for building structures, should consider windstorm climate types for mixed climates. However, it is very difficult to obtain windstorm climate types from meteorological data records, therefore, it restricts the application of extreme wind speed estimation in mixed climates. This paper first proposes a windstorm type identification algorithm based on a numerical pattern recognition method that utilizes feature extraction and generalization. Subsequently, three sets of model experiments are conducted using data from three meteorological stations on the southeast coast of China from 1990 to 2016, and the prediction of a single station model and a regional model is discussed. The prediction performances of six machine learning algorithms under different experiments are compared. Based on classification results, the extreme wind speeds calculated based on mixed windstorm types are compared with those obtained from conventional methods, and the effects on structural design for different return periods are analyzed.

AB - This paper presents a comprehensive experimental and numerical investigation into the cross-section behavior and resistances of S690 high-strength steel welded I-sections under combined compression and bending moment. First, a testing program was carried out and included initial local geometric imperfection measurements and ten major-axis and minor-axis combined loading tests. The testing program was followed by a numerical modeling program, where finite-element models were developed and validated against the test results and then used to perform parametric studies to generate further numerical data over a wide range of cross-section dimensions and loading combinations. On the basis of the test and numerical data, the codified interaction curves for S690 high-strength steel nonslender welded I-sections under combined loading, as used in Europe, Australia, and the US, were evaluated. The evaluation results revealed that (1)&nbsp;the European code yields accurate resistance predictions for S690 high-strength steel Classes 1 and 2 welded I-sections under both major-axis and minor-axis combined loading but underestimates the resistances for their Class 3 counterparts, (2)&nbsp;the Australian standard leads to a high level of conservatism for S690 high-strength steel nonslender welded I-sections under combined loading, and (3)&nbsp;the American specification can well predict the resistances for S690 high-strength steel nonslender welded I-sections under major-axis combined loading but results in conservative resistance predictions for those under minor-axis combined loading. The reliability of the codified interaction curves was also evaluated by means of statistical analyses.

AB - The cohesive zone model (CZM), which is capable of simulating the behavior of adhesively bonded joints subjected to static and fatigue loading, is widely accepted. In this study, fatigue peeling/shear of RC with externally bonded (EB) carbon fiber–reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates under the mixed-mode implementation of the CZM is proposed. The procedure has been implemented in commercial software by programming the appropriate software-embedded subroutines. The main advantage of the proposed CZM is the use of coupled mixed-mode damage (shear-peeling), accounting for cumulative damage resulting from fatigue loading. Two-dimensional numerical simulations of the innovative double-lap-shear bonding test were performed by the proposed CZM. The excellent agreement between the simulated results and the experimental results are verified, and the good performance of the method as a predictive tool is demonstrated. Moreover, the peeling/shear propagation during loading can be effectively predicted.

AB - In this work, a new self-centering shear wall with disc spring devices (SCSW-DSD) was developed and experimentally verified. The proposed SCSW-DSD was a combination of a reinforced concrete (RC) wall and two disc spring devices (DSDs), and the DSD comprised both a self-centering device to provide restoring force and a friction energy dissipator to dissipate seismic energy. Two SCSW-DSD specimens with different additional friction forces were designed and fabricated, and four low reversed cyclic loading tests were conducted to investigate the effect of additional friction on the seismic behavior. The results reveal that the SCSW-DSD specimens exhibited stable self-centering and effective energy dissipation during all four tests, and the bearing capacity and energy dissipation increased with the increase of additional friction force. The residual drift ratios of the SCSW-DSD specimens were also reduced by installing the DSDs. In addition, the main parts of the RC wall remained elastic at a drift ratio of 3% after the first loading tests. Although cracks and local concrete crushing occurred at the bottom of the RC wall, these could be repaired, and the earthquake resilience requirements were still met after the second loadings.

AB - This data paper presents the experimental investigation of unconfined cold-formed steel double-shear bolted connections where the applied load was stopped at different stages of loading (25% or 65% of the ultimate failure load under monotonic loading) followed by unloading, and finally reloading until failure. A total of 78 bolted connections of cold-formed steel subjected to loading–unloading and reloading conditions with sheet thicknesses ranging from 0.55 to 3.0&nbsp;mm, bolted with 10, 12, or 16-mm bolts were investigated and compared to the identical specimens subjected to monotonic loading. The failure mode of the specimens tested under both loading conditions was bearing of the inner sheet. The test results show that ultimate capacities obtained from unloading and reloading tests were, on average, lower than those obtained from the monotonic tests. A similar trend was also observed for the displacement corresponding to the ultimate loads. However, the effects of sheet thickness and bolt diameter were found to be less critical. This study establishes a publicly available database of control cases to build the foundation for further study into similar loading regimes. This paper also alludes to several potential use cases for the available data.
