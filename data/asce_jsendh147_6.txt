AB - Nonlinear static and dynamic analyses are increasingly being used to evaluate the seismic performance of structures. The level of detail that mathematical models should include depends on the required analysis. In a collapse performance evaluation of special steel moment frames, models must include material and element deterioration due to local geometrical instabilities that will allow triggering structural instability. However, capturing these effects in distributed plasticity models is challenging for two reasons: (1)&nbsp;the selection of a constitutive law that incorporates the geometrical phenomenon, and (2)&nbsp;the localization issues related to the material softening. This paper proposes a simple approach to implement phenomenological calibrated constitutive law that includes compression softening applied on a distributed plasticity model. Additionally, a regularization method is proposed to reduce mesh-sensitivity, ensuring an objective response. The constitutive law and the regularization method are tested under different modeling levels: material, element, and structure. Furthermore, the model is used to perform collapse analyses of 2-, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 20-story special steel moment frame buildings. The proposed model can incorporate critical features, such as flexure-axial force interaction, postpeak deterioration, and an objective global response regardless of the element discretization.

AB - A spectrum of simplified methods for estimating building seismic drift demands is conceptualized. On one extreme are mechanics-based approaches that are derived solely from fundamental engineering principles. On the other end are purely data-driven models that are developed using parametric data sets generated from nonlinear response history analyses. Between these two extremes, there are models that combine elements of basic engineering principles and statistical learning (hybrid models). First, the benefits and drawbacks of four existing simplified seismic response estimation methodologies that fall within this spectrum of approaches are critically examined. Subsequently, a generalized framework for developing and validating hybrid and/or purely data-driven seismic demand estimation models is proposed. Using this framework, two new machine learning–based models are developed and rigorously evaluated. Finally, a comparative assessment of the existing and newly developed models is conducted while focusing on their predictive performance and the level of effort needed to implement them.

AB - The present work reports the results of two quasi-static reverse cyclic tests performed on an unreinforced hollow clay block masonry building before and after repairing with a single 30-mm thick layer of mortar applied on the façades. Unlike traditional coating-based retrofitting techniques, the one proposed herein adopts a cement-based mortar reinforced with short high-strength steel fibers randomly diffused in the mortar matrix. In order to assess the effectiveness of the strengthening intervention, a preliminary cyclic test was carried out on the unstrengthened building in order to predamage masonry. The experimental results showed that the repaired structure exhibited a significant improvement of seismic behavior both at the serviceability and ultimate limit state conditions. Moreover, based on the observed ultimate ductility of the retrofitted building, some considerations on the behavior factor are reported.

AB - Aluminum alloys are being increasingly used in a wide range of construction applications owing to their sound mechanical properties, lightness in weight, strong corrosion resistance, ability to be formed into complex and efficient cross-sectional shapes, and natural aesthetics. Aluminum alloys are characterized by a rounded stress–strain response, with no sharply defined yield point. Such behavior can be accurately represented using Ramberg–Osgood-type equations. In the present study, use of a two-stage Ramberg–Osgood model to describe the full-range stress–strain behavior of aluminum alloys is proposed and, following careful analysis of a comprehensive database of aluminum alloy coupon test data assembled from the literature, standardized values or predictive expressions for the required input parameters are derived. The experimental database includes over 700 engineering stress–strain curves obtained from 56 sources and covers five common aluminum alloy grades: 5052-H36, 6061-T6, 6063-T5, 6082-T6, and 7A04-T6. The developed model is shown to be more accurate in predicting the full-range stress–strain response of aluminum alloys than existing expressions, and is suitable for use in the analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and advanced design of aluminum alloy structures.

AB - In detailed three-dimensional (3D) finite-element modeling, two-dimensional and/or 3D elements are widely used because of their high accuracy and ease of use despite the high computational cost. In contrast, simplified modeling based on fiber beam element (FBE) formulation is preferred for developing macro models to simulate structural frames due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. As for the FBE simulation of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns, its accuracy largely depends on the input steel and concrete material models, which should implicitly consider the material nonlinearity and interaction between the steel and concrete components. The authors have previously developed a FBE model for circular CFST columns, and this paper is a continuation of the previous work. In this paper, uniaxial effective stress–strain relationships are developed for the steel and concrete materials in rectangular CFST columns based on rigorous analysis of data generated from 3D finite-element modeling of stub columns. Thus, the material models have implicitly considered the effects of yielding and local buckling of the steel tube and passive confinement to the concrete. Meanwhile, the size effect is also considered in the concrete model. The accuracy of the proposed material models is verified against a database of rectangular CFST stub columns covering a wide range of material and geometric parameters. The developed material models are further used to simulate rectangular CFST slender columns and beam-columns, and a reasonably good agreement is achieved between the experimental and predicted load–deformation curves.

AB - A large number of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings constructed prior to the mid-1970s in earthquake-prone regions rely on lightly reinforced or perforated perimeter structural walls to resist earthquake-induced lateral loads. These walls are susceptible to damage when subjected to moderate-to-strong shaking; a number of such cases were observed in past earthquakes. Despite these observations, there are limited studies reported in the literature that investigate the loss of axial (gravity) load-carrying capacity of damaged walls and wall piers, primarily due to limited experimental data. This study utilized a comprehensive database that includes detailed information on more than 1,100 RC wall tests. To study wall axial failure, the database was filtered to identify and analyze data sets of tests on shear- and flexure-controlled walls. The findings indicated that axial failure occurs in flexure-controlled walls with special and ordinary detailing, and that axial failure mechanisms include complex phenomena influenced by various parameters. For diagonal shear-controlled walls, axial failure results from sliding along a critical crack plane extending diagonally over the height of the wall when the shear friction demand exceeds the shear friction capacity. Based on the results, expressions were developed to predict lateral drift capacity at axial failure of RC walls and piers.

AB - Plate girders, usually characterized by having large depth-to-web thickness ratios, have been widely used for long-span applications in bridges and buildings. US design provisions (AISC specifications for building design and AASHTO specifications for bridge design) permit the strength contribution from tension-field action after web buckling in calculating the design shear strength of interior panels, but not exterior panels. Testing of four large-size steel plate girders demonstrated a much higher shear resistance of end panels than those predicted by code provisions. Based on the failure mode observed from both testing and finite element simulation, an analytical model was developed to simulate the collapse mechanism. Plastic analysis was used to derive a shear strength equation. This equation, similar in format to that used in current design codes for interior panels, includes a parameter βv to account for the contribution of partial tension-field action.

AB - Light-timber frames, using plywood (PW), exhibit a pinched hysteresis response, and their energy absorption capacity is limited. The energy-dissipation capacity can be enhanced using energy-dissipation mechanisms. In this paper, two wood-friction-based connectors, with wood-plywood-wood (WPW) and wood-steel-wood (WSW), are utilized. Reverse-cyclic static load tests have shown that the WPW and WSW wall systems have nondegrading and stable hysteretic curves. In this paper, through shake-table tests, performance of WPW, WSW, PW, and WSW-PW coupled wall systems are investigated. As expected, the shake-table results indeed showed nondegrading hysteretic curve responses of WPW and WSW wall systems. Furthermore, a phenomenological model, where nonlinear behavior of the shear wall is reduced to a single spring element, is proposed for the wall systems. The nondegrading wall system (WPW, WSW) is modeled using the Bouc-Wen hysteretic model and the PW is modeled using the Pinching4 hysteretic model. Overall, there is good agreement between the test and analytical models. Results of the experimental test indeed show the utility of the new wall systems.

AB - A novel reinforced concrete structural member comprising ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) and engineered cementitious composite (ECC) was proposed for use in underground structures, such as prefabricated utility tunnels. In this composite member, UHPC was used as the exterior (i.e.,&nbsp;soil side) protective layer to prevent the penetration of water and corrosive agents, and ECC was used as the interior (i.e.,&nbsp;service environment side) protective layer to improve the member’s crack-control capacity and fire resistance. Ordinary concrete was filled between the UHPC and ECC layers. The composite member was reinforced with perforated steel plates to achieve strong mechanical interaction between the composite materials and to ensure structural integrity. The proposed composite was experimentally characterized as follows. The tension-stiffening effect in ECC panels with a perforated steel plate was evaluated using direct tensile tests. The flexural behavior of the reinforced UHPC–concrete–ECC members was characterized with four-point bending tests. The failure processes of the composite members were analyzed via the digital image correlation (DIC) method. Finally, a simplified theoretical method was developed to estimate the yield and ultimate load-carrying capacities of the composite member, and the estimated results showed good agreement with the test results. Overall, the proposed composite member had favorable mechanical performance and durability due to the strategic use of UHPC and ECC.

AB - The inclusion of fibers substantially improves the shear resistance of reinforced concrete beams. Fibers can, therefore, be used as a partial or full substitute for traditional transverse reinforcement. Before replacement of traditional reinforcement with fibers can be undertaken, reliable expressions that incorporate the effect of fibers are required. In a previous study, a mechanics approach based on quantifying the presliding shear capacity of fiber-reinforced concrete beams was developed, broadly validated, and compared with existing design approaches. Although accurate, the numerical solution is too complicated for routine design, and hence, in this paper, simplified solutions are developed. This is achieved by (1)&nbsp;approximating the neutral axis depth at the initiation of shear failure, (2)&nbsp;developing a closed-form solution for the angle of the critical diagonal shear crack, removing the need to iterate, and (3)&nbsp;incorporating a simple approach to estimate the stress in the fibers crossing cracks, removing the need to integrate fiber stresses over a range of crack widths. To validate the simplified solutions, they are used to predict the capacity of tests on 626 reinforced concrete beams without stirrups, 176 reinforced concrete beams with stirrups, and 23 fiber-reinforced concrete beams. Importantly, these simplified solutions largely retain the accuracy of the numerical approach and show an improved fit compared with currently available solutions.

AB - This work deals with experimental and numerical investigations on the rotation capacity of high-strength steel (HSS) I-girders. The investigation involved 20 three-point bending tests conducted on mainly homogeneous and hybrid high-strength steel girders. The experimental tests have successfully been recalculated numerically considering damage mechanics approaches to model ductile crack initiation. The test of the high-strength steel beams showed that they are able to withstand large rotations with maintaining the plastic-moment capacity. The rotation requirement of Eurocode (EC) 3, doubtful as it might seem, was achieved by 16 of 18 HSS girders.

AB - Recently, several events involving the corrosion-induced damage of gusset plate connections of steel truss bridges have been reported worldwide. In this study, the remaining load-carrying capacity of a corroded gusset plate connection was evaluated through loading tests and finite element method (FEM) analyses using a model approximately 50% of the size of an actual gusset plate connection. Two potential forms of corrosion, that is, weld and cross-sectional corrosion, on the gusset plate were considered in order to investigate the reduction in the load-carrying capacity. Then, parametric FEM analyses were conducted to determine the effect of the corrosion level on the remaining load-carrying capacity of a specimen model and a full-scale model of an actual connection. The loading tests and parametric FEM analyses indicated that with increases in the dimensions of the corroded sections, the load-carrying capacity of the gusset plate connections exhibited nearly similar linear decreases. Furthermore, the effectiveness of a repair method for the corroded gusset plate connection using carbon fiber–reinforced plastic (CFRP) sheets was investigated. The loading tests were conducted considering the area, direction, and location of the bonded CFRP sheets. As a result, this study proposed an appropriate repair method using CFRP sheets that could help recover the load-carrying capacity and improve the deformation performance of corroded gusset plate connections.

AB - Recent analytical studies have highlighted the existence of a failure-mode transition zone within which nominally identical test specimens may experience variability in failure mode between a flexure-dominated and a shear-dominated mechanism. This paper presents a study on the seismic response of four nominally identical nonductile RC circular columns susceptible to failure-mode uncertainty designed to represent typical New Zealand pre-1995 poorly detailed gravity columns. In this study, the influence of inherent material uncertainty and displacement history on the collapse response of the nominally identical columns was investigated. Experimental results showed that the failure mode of lightly confined RC columns can be influenced by displacement history and inherent material uncertainty. As observed in this study, the nominally identical columns experienced different failure modes, even under the same loading protocol, leading to a significant variation in drift capacity at axial failure (ranging from 1.5% to 2.6%) and residual axial capacity of RC columns (ranging from 200 to 650&nbsp;kN).

AB - Accurate prediction/forecasting of the future response of civil infrastructure plays an essential role in health monitoring and safety assessment. However, the complex latent dynamics within the field sensing measurements makes the forecasting task challenging. To this end, this paper leverages the recent advances in deep learning and proposes a spatiotemporal learning framework to forecast structural responses with strong temporal dependencies and spatial correlations. The key concept is to establish a convolutional long-short term memory (ConvLSTM) network to learn spatiotemporal latent features from data and thus establish a surrogate model for structural response forecasting. The proposed approach is applied to predict the strain response for a concrete bridge with over three-year measurements available. A comparative study is also conducted against a traditional temporal-only network to highlight the forecasting performance of the proposed approach. Convincing results demonstrate that the ConvLSTM approach is a promising, reliable, and computationally efficient approach that is capable of accurately forecasting the dynamical response of civil infrastructure in a data-driven manner.

AB - Lateral resistance of shear walls constructed with wood-based sheathing panels and lumber framing is largely governed by the strength of the sheathing-to-framing nailed joints. In new wall designs, a layer of soft thermal insulation is added between the sheathing and framing to increase the wall thermal resistance. Studying the influence of the intermediate insulation on the lateral load resistance of the nailed joint is essential for understanding the structural behavior of this kind of shear walls. An experimental study was conducted to measure the lateral resistance of the nailed joints. The results show that the insulation has a significant impact on the lateral resistance. An analytical model for predicting the lateral resistance, with embedment strengths of sheathing and framing members and nail bending strength as input parameters, was developed. The model predictions were compared with those from existing analytical models and with the experimental data. The ultimate lateral resistance of the nailed joints can be predicted with sufficient accuracy using the developed analytical model for the joints with up to 51-mm-thick intermediate insulation layers.

AB - Thin-walled steel tubes are highly recommended to be used in concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) columns due to their economic benefits. However, the inherent difficulty of connections between the steel tube and foundation limits the application of thin-walled CFSTs. Four types of CFST column-to-foundation connections employing anchor bars to resist the bending moment are proposed, avoiding the insertion of the steel tube into the foundation. In this paper, the design method for the proposed column-to-foundation connections was first studied. Eight column-to-foundation connections for thin-walled CFST columns were tested under combined constant axial load and cyclic lateral load. The observed failure modes, load-displacement hysteresis curves, load-displacement skeleton curves, circumferential stiffness, energy-dissipation coefficient, and load-strain curves of steel tube were analyzed and presented. The experimental results and theoretical analyses indicated that properly designed connections possessed higher bending strength and better ductility than traditional embedded connections.

AB - Nonlinear response history analysis has been a powerful tool in performance-based earthquake engineering for validating the proposed design of new structures or evaluating existing ones. When it is applied to structural systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, such as three-dimensional (3D) models of tall buildings, bridges, or dams, the analyses can be time-consuming. The prolonged computing times become more prominent in parametric studies or in incremental dynamic analyses. In order to reduce the computation time, this study proposes a practical method—a reducing time steps (RTS) procedure—whereby leading and trailing weak signals in the input acceleration record are trimmed, and the remaining record is downsampled. The test results based on several different 3D computer models of reinforced-concrete idealized structures demonstrate that the RTS method is practical, and it provides estimates of engineering demand parameters such as peak values of story drift, floor acceleration, and floor velocity within 10% of the results obtained by using the original records. The RTS procedure was further validated on three symmetric-plan steel buildings with 5, 9, and 15 stories. For all analyzed cases, the average reduction in computational time was around 50%.

AB - Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings make up a significant portion of the built environment, with hollow clay being the predominant choice for the units. The capacity of URM buildings is a function of the capacity of its walls, both to vertical and horizontal forces. However, URM is particularly vulnerable to the effect of horizontal forces due to the low tensile strength of the mortar that holds the units together. URM walls are subject to significant in-plane horizontal forces during seismic events, so that a proper quantification of the capacity of URM walls to this type of forces is required. The models in design codes are often conservative and do not capture the uncertainties required for estimating the failure probability of URM walls. This paper develops probabilistic capacity models for URM walls with hollow clay units subject to horizontal in-plane forces. The models are developed considering diagonal cracking, flexural/rocking, and sliding failure as possible failure modes. The models are constructed starting from existing physics-based models that attempt to capture the underlying physics, and then developing correction terms that improve the accuracy of the models and remove the inherent bias. Unknown parameters for the proposed models are calibrated using a Bayesian updating approach. The proposed models are probabilistic and capture the relevant uncertainties. The proposed models are used to assess fragility functions of example URM walls subject to horizontal in-plane forces. The comparison of the fragility functions shows the effect of selected variables.

AB - Punching shear capacity is an important parameter in designing structural elements. Accurate estimation of punching shear capacity typically requires rigorous calculation schemes. Especially for fiber-reinforced slabs, traditional design methods may not be sufficient to predict the interaction between different influencing parameters affecting punching shear capacity for such slabs. In this study, multiple state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms were utilized, namely, regression learner, ensemble tree (bagged and boosted), support vector machine (SVM), regression decision tree, Gaussian process regression (GPR), and artificial neural networks (ANN). A comprehensive evaluation of the six ML techniques was conducted with respect to model accuracy and computational efficiency. The results demonstrated that the ANN-based algorithms outperformed other ML approaches based on the values of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (R2). Furthermore, the analysis of the results has shown that the slab effective depth has the most significant effect on the predicted punching shear, followed by the width of applied load and concrete compressive strength. Python coding (with the assist of Pynomo software) was utilized to create nomographs integrated with weights resulting from the neural network model. Such neuro-nomographs can be used to simulate the results of the developed ANN model. Moreover, the values of tested punching shear capacities over predicted values (Vtest/Vpred) using the neuro-nomograph have shown mean and coefficient of variation (COV) values of 1.00 and 0.05, respectively, indicating remarkably minor scatter in the prediction.

AB - The addition of steel fibers to concrete in ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) to form ultrahigh-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) has been shown to have a great benefit by substantially increasing the flexural capacities and ductilities at the ultimate limit state and reducing crack widths and increasing flexural rigidities at the serviceability limit state. This is because the fibers bridge a crack and consequently allow tensile stresses across the crack. Tests also have shown that tensile cyclic loads applied across a crack can reduce these benefits by allowing the crack to widen through a gradual debonding of the fibers. To quantify the behavior of UHPFRC post cracking, the fatigue behavior of steel microfiber concrete at a crack was studied through 33 tensile fatigue tests on precracked UHPFRC and 6 monotonic tests. An approach for processing the results based on the increase in crack width per cycle, that is the incremental set, was developed and can be applied to any UHPFRC that exhibits debonding. Three distinct cyclic behaviors were identified and quantified: no incremental set, such that there is no quantifiable damage due to cyclic loading; the incremental set is constant, such that there is quantifiable damage; and a rapid unstable increase in the incremental set.

AB - Effective bracing systems for columns and beams exist in many forms, including point bracing and continuous bracing. Employing continuous bracing formulations for cases with point braces provides an attractive solution that can significantly improve the efficiency and economy of the bracing design relative to current methods commonly utilized in design. This paper focuses on the fundamental behavior of continuous bracing formulations applied to column and beams systems. An approximate solution was discovered in the late nineteenth century that provides an elegant solution that dramatically improves efficiency of lateral column and beam bracing compared to traditional point brace solutions that are based on the ideal stiffness requirements. The paper addresses the inelastic buckling for columns and beams and also discusses a wide range of bracing categories. Application of the continuous bracing formulation for point bracing solutions for columns and beams results in significant improvements in the efficiency and accuracy of predictions of the stiffness requirements for many problems. Design recommendations are provided for utilizing continuous lateral bracing formations for columns and beams. In addition, the interaction between lateral and torsional point braces for beams is discussed.

AB - Finite-element models of varying sophistication may be employed to determine a building’s seismic response with increasing complexity, potentially offering a higher fidelity at the cost of the computational load. To account for this effect on the reliability of performance assessment, model-type uncertainty needs to be incorporated as distinct to the uncertainty related to a given model’s parameters. At present, only placeholder values are available in seismic guidelines. Instead, we attempt to quantify them accurately for a modern 20-story steel moment-resisting frame. Different types of three-dimensional (3D), two-dimensional (2D) multibay, and 2D single-bay multidegree-of-freedom models are investigated, together with their equivalent single-degree-of-freedom ones, to evaluate the model dependency of the response both within each broad model category, as well as among different categories. In conclusion, ensemble values are recommended for the uncertainty in each model category showing that for the perfectly-symmetric perimeter-frame P-Δ sensitive building under investigation, the uncertainty stemming from 3D versus 2D or distributed versus lumped plasticity models is lower than the governing record-to-record variability.

AB - A new multistrut macromodel for the analysis of the progressive-collapse response of infilled reinforced concrete (RC) frames is presented in this paper. The model consists of three struts: two outer infinitely rigid and resistant struts and one inner fiber-section strut. The inclination of the struts as well as the stress–strain response are modulated by two parameters that are obtained by means of analytical correlations provided in the paper. The latter link the geometric and mechanical properties of an infilled frame to the geometric configuration and mechanical response of the equivalent strut model. This confers the model the capability to adapt to consider different collapse configurations. The analytical correlations are obtained from an experimental data set of pushdown tests, enlarged with data from refined finite-element (FE) simulations. Validation tests are finally carried out comparing the model prediction with results of experimental and FE pushdown tests not considered for the definition of the empirical database. Results show that, because of its flexibility, the model is sufficiently reliable and, at the same time, of simple implementation in FE analysis software to perform progressive-collapse simulations.

AB - In this paper, the seismic performance and resilience of a 15-story variable-damping self-centering braced frame (VD–SCBF) were analyzed. The interstory drift ratios (IDRs) of the VD–SCBF are similar to those of the buckling-restrained braced frame, but are lower than the prepressed self-centering braced frame (PS–SCBF). The residual deformation ratios (RDRs) of the VD–SCBF are reduced, and its story acceleration ratios are smaller than the PS–SCBF. Under near-fault earthquakes, the higher-order mode has a greater impact, which increases the inelastic response and ductility demand. The effects of the brace design parameters on structural performance were also investigated. The optimal design parameters are as follows: the activation displacement is appropriately small; the variable-damping region corresponds to the axial displacement of 1% IDR; the ratio of the prepressed force to initial Coulomb damping force is 1.0–1.1; and the viscous damping coefficient increases. Combining the damage development process of different components, the VD–SCBF can be designed based on its four seismic performance levels to ensure a reliable resilience.

AB - The coastal region of China suffers from severe typhoons. Hazard mitigation and risk management require a good estimation of the typhoon wind speed. In this study, an enhanced circular subregion method (CSM) is proposed. The efforts are mainly made in three aspects. First, a new treatment is developed to model the observed central pressure difference better. Second, the appropriate size for the enhanced CSM is discussed. Studies indicate that 500&nbsp;km is appropriate. Third, Nataf transformation is introduced to incorporate the correlations among typhoon key parameters in wind hazard estimation. The enhanced CSM combined with a typhoon wind field model is used to assess the typhoon hazard for nine cities located in the coastal region of mainland China. Results show the design wind speeds predicted by traditional CSM are lower than those by the enhanced CSM for nine cities with an averaged difference of 4.3% for 50-year and 4.9% for 100-year return periods. The maximum difference was 6.1% in Fuzhou for 100-year return periods. Results also show the consideration of correlations among typhoon key parameters results in a change of the design wind speed at less than 2% for nine cities. Note that the consideration of correlations may not be neglected in other countries.
