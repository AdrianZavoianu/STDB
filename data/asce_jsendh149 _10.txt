AB - The fire resistance of corroded reinforced concrete has attracted extensive attention, mainly due to the frequent occurrence of fires in old structures. However, using the postfire bond strength to predict structural capacity during fires leads to inaccurate results. Thus, in this study, an accelerated corrosion test and an eccentric pullout test were performed under steady-state conditions from 20°C to 800°C. The test results indicated that compared with the bond strength at 20°C, the bond strength at 200°C decreased by 6% for the corroded specimen (corrosion level below 4.3%) and increased by 11% for the uncorroded specimen. When the temperature exceeded 500°C, the storage modulus and bond strength decreased 55%. Increasing the rebar diameter reduced the bond strength by approximately 29% and made the descending section of the τ-s curve steeper during exposure to fire. The energy dissipation at 100°C was larger than that at other temperatures, and the bond stiffness at 600°C was 12.5% of that at 20°C. The reduction in bond stiffness postponed the development of splitting cracks, restricted the crack width, and prevented splitting failure. Subsequently, temperatures dependence was analyzed and methods were proposed for the calculation of bond strengths at elevated temperatures. The results obtained with the proposed continuous bond-slip model were in satisfactory agreement with the pullout test results. Finally, the comparison of integral absolute error indicated that the model could be used to make accurate calculations of bond strengths during fires.

AB - Topographic effects are known to accelerate wind speeds in hilly or mountainous terrains and consequently increase wind-induced damage. Here we describe a heuristic model developed to estimate wind-induced speedups in complex terrain. The model, originally developed for use in Hawaii, was validated using topographic wind speedup data obtained using 1∶3,100 scale boundary layer wind tunnel experiments performed at the University of Florida. Wind speedup data were produced for 16 wind directions. Speedup data were collected for six-different topographic models covering various portions of Puerto Rico and the surrounding islands. Comparisons of the heuristic model results to the measured speedups produced R2 values ranging between 50% and 65%. The resulting speedup model presented here can be easily used with topographic data for other islands. Estimates of the directional topographic speedups were developed for a 100-m grid encompassing Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The directionally dependent speedups were combined with hurricane wind speed and direction data developed using a 100,000-year simulation of wind speeds and directions to produce estimates of the design wind speeds for ASCE 7-22 including the effects of topographic speedups. These wind speed data were produced using a grid with a resolution of approximately 100&nbsp;m. The data are used in both ASCE 7-22 and the Puerto Rico building code.

AB - Mass timber buildings are increasing in popularity as the building industry aims to use more sustainable construction materials. A lateral force resisting system with a mass timber frame and a timber buckling restrained brace (TBRB) is presented as a possible solution to allow the expanded use of mass timber in buildings located in cities with high risk of natural hazards such as earthquakes and hurricanes. A series of nine quasi-static cyclic tests was completed to study the performance of the TBRB frame as well as the elastic performance of the bare mass timber frame. The variables studied included the level of axial force applied to the columns to simulate gravity load and the out-of-plane displacement of the TBRB frame. The mass timber frame was tested four times with a different TBRB. The four subassemblies achieved a drift ratio of at least 2.8% before failure of the TBRB due to weak axis buckling of the steel core. The maximum displacement ductility of the four TBRB frame subassemblies ranged from 3.1 to 3.5. The addition of the TBRB enhanced the energy dissipation capacity of the bare mass timber frame by 4.0 to 8.6 times after 14 cycles of lateral displacement.

AB - A cross-laminated timber (CLT) wall panel offers an efficient solution to resist seismic loads. Earthquake-induced vibrations can be accommodated and dampened by ductile connections that hold down a rocking wall panel. In conventional hold-downs, irreversible damage from localized crushing of timber and/or withdrawal of slender steel fasteners results in pinching behavior. The impaired stiffness and dissipation are understood to cause larger peak displacements and increase the vulnerability of structures to aftershocks. To overcome this, a pinching-free connector (PFC) was developed previously, and in the present study it was tested as hold-downs for a rocking CLT wall. Quasi-static and pseudodynamic tests demonstrated that the PFCs significantly reduced pinching and provided additional restoring forces from the hold-downs near the rocking toe by responding elastically between 0.6% and 2% drift. Below this drift, the wall recentered under self-weight, because the PFCs are ratcheting tension-only connectors that do not resist recentering. Nevertheless, restoring forces may be possible over a larger range of drifts by positioning the PFCs closer to the edges of the wall. Although minimal restoring forces allow high dissipation in every cycle, the number of cycles is limited by the elongation capacity of the mild steel rods that yield monotonically. Stainless-steel rods therefore are suggested as alternative dissipators with greater ductility. In the ratcheting mechanism (screw threads), inherent backlash of 1.38&nbsp;mm manifested as slack on reloading or out-of-sync ratcheting and reloading when a pair of hold-downs was used. Consequently, the initial stiffness can decrease by as much as one-half, because one PFC engages only after the other has started to yield. Future research is recommended with roller clutches and circular friction pads to eliminate the backlash and provide large and stable ductility and dissipation. The lightweight CLT wall tested (&lt;200  kg) demonstrates the potential of ratcheting connectors to create efficient seismic-resisting systems that self-center without any posttensioning.

AB - In this study, an interior joint between timber-concrete composite (TCC) beams and steel column was as tested under quasistatic cyclic loads. To obtain an acceptable seismic performance, a type of innovative semirigid beam-to-column connection with screwed-in threaded rods (STRs) and novel steel links was designed for the joint. For validation, the detailed three-dimensional finite element (FE) models considering the elastic-plastic damage behavior of the materials were established in ABAQUS version 6.14. The test results demonstrated that owing to the excellent energy dissipation capacity of the steel links, the joints showed good seismic performance with plump hysteretic curves. Also, the stiffness and load-carrying capacity of the joint composite with concrete slab were higher than those of the joint with bare timber beams. However, because the yielding and deformation capacity of the beam-to-column connections were primarily derived from the steel links, the presence of a concrete slab had limited improvement on the energy dissipation capacity of the joints. Additionally, the FE model could clearly present the failure modes of the TCC joint, including the fracture of steel components, cracking of concrete, and withdrawal slip of threaded rods. The FE numerical results also showed good agreement with the test results in terms of the hysteretic curves, energy dissipation capacity, and stiffness degradation behavior.

AB - This paper proposes a novel strategy based on field measurement, wind tunnel tests, and artificial neural network (ANN) for reconstructing the wind pressures on cladding of high-rise buildings and applies it to reconstruct the extreme wind pressures on a 600-m-high skyscraper during Super Typhoon Mangkhut. In this study, four neural network models are developed for reconstruction of wind pressures on the model of the skyscraper based on wind tunnel test results. The reconstruction performance of the developed models was assessed by a proposed evaluation criterion. Then, the model with the best performance was utilized to reconstruct the extreme wind pressures on cladding of the skyscraper during Super Typhoon Mangkhut based on the wind pressure measurements at limited locations in the wind tunnel test and field measurements. The results reveal that the proposed strategy can capture the extreme wind pressures missed by the field measurements during the strong windstorm. Notably, this is the first attempt based on field measurements and wind tunnel testing to reconstruct the extreme wind pressures on cladding of a supertall building during an extreme typhoon event using the artificial intelligence technology, which aims to provide useful information for the wind-resistant cladding design of high-rise buildings.

AB - Reinforced concrete (RC) bridge piers, one of the most widely used pier types, are vulnerable to damage during an earthquake and may not have sufficient durability against the harsh environment. To tackle these problems, a prefabricated UHPC tube, as the permanent formwork, was proposed to replace the cover concrete of the RC piers in enhancing the seismic performance of RC bridge piers. In this study, cyclic loading tests and numerical analyses were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the UHPC tube. Three specimens, including one reference RC column and two prefabricated UHPC tube–confined (PUTC) columns, were fabricated and tested under quasi-static cyclic load. For specimen PUTC1, the prefabricated tube is disconnected from the footing at the column base. To utilize the tensile strength of UHPC (greater than 6&nbsp;MPa), the tube is embedded into the footing in specimen PUTC2. The numerical study is performed to further examine the effects of six design parameters on the cyclic responses of the PUTC columns. The results demonstrated that the use of the UHPC tube can significantly enhance the seismic performance of the RC columns and reduce their seismic damage. The tube-to-footing connection noticeably affects the cyclic behavior of the PUTC columns. Due to the contribution of the UHPC tensile strength, embedding the UHPC tube into the footing can reduce the measured strain of the longitudinal reinforcements inside the footing. The embedded connection improves the maximum lateral force and displacement ductility by 26.0 and 8.3%, respectively, compared with the pier with the unembedded UHPC tube. The PUTC column with embedded UHPC tube exhibits less residual deformation because of the bridging effect of the steel fibers and confinement effect of the tube. When the UHPC tube is properly designed, it can be used to fully substitute transverse reinforcements and partially substitute longitudinal reinforcements in the PUTC columns.

AB - This paper presents an improved design approach based on the direct strength method (DSM) in American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) design specification S100 for cold-formed steel (CFS) built-up closed cross-section columns subjected to local, global, and local–global interaction buckling modes. Initially, the failure mode and load data corresponding to various design parameters such as intermediate fastener connection spacing, boundary conditions, material properties, slenderness, and cross sections from various researchers are collected, including the authors’ test results. The design predictions using the current DSM design provisions are compared with the collected test results. The results show that the current DSM approach requires improvisation to adequately predict the axial compression load. The data are then analyzed to understand the behavioral features of the built-up closed cross-section column such as limit for interaction buckling, erosion of strength due to arrant interaction buckling, and increase in strength due to flange or web overlapping effect. The interpretation methods used to improve the current design approach are presented. The original DSM design procedure is improved by failure mode classification and modified slenderness to account for increase and erosion in strength. Finally, the safety (accuracy and reliability) of the design predictions from the improved DSM-based approach is assessed using the large amount of data collected. Since the introduction of the direct strength method to the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (AISI S100) in 2001, it has gained traction among design engineers due to its simplicity, advantages over other design methods, and specific design curves for individual buckling modes. To implement the DSM for CFS built-up members, several researchers have proposed different design approaches, and research is still happening. This study is also aimed toward the same objective but is specific to the local–global interaction in built-up members. It is demonstrated why the DSM prediction is unsafe for CFS built-up members with larger intermediate fastener connection spacing and excessively safe for CFS built-up members with closer intermediate fastener connection spacing. An intermediate fastener connection spacing limit that separates the local–global interaction buckling and element overlapping effect is determined. A design proposal for limiting the interaction buckling mode and considering the overlapping effect of elements in the DSM design method is suggested. More specifically, the proposed design method is in line with the current AISI approach so the designer need not confuse how to use this new design approach in practice. Therefore, for further ease of understanding, two design examples for built-up closed cross-section columns—(1)&nbsp;subjected to local–global interaction buckling; and (2)&nbsp;subjected to element overlapping effect—are included in this paper. It is also recommended that future research may focus on further classifying the AISI main specification sections, E2 and F2 (simple classifications based on the global failure modes), based on the interaction buckling modes in built-up cross-section members.

AB - Following the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge due to an aeroelastic instability, it has been common practice to test cable-supported bridges in a wind tunnel to check the soundness of bridge designs with respect to wind dynamic actions. Due to their simplicity, versatility and cost effectiveness, section model tests have become the standard approach for testing bridges. More advanced testing techniques, like full-aeroelastic model tests, are only utilized for validation purposes toward the end of the design process. Nevertheless, some generalizations with regard to the behavior of the bridge are necessary in section model tests in order to reach such simplicity. One of them is that they assume a linear structural behavior of the bridge structure. This might be inaccurate for very long cable-supported bridges as the structural behavior of such bridges is governed by their cable system, which is geometrically nonlinear. Considering that span lengths are getting longer, it is believed that it is needed to develop a better understanding of the influence of geometric nonlinearities on the wind response of bridges. Thus, this paper presents an experimental assessment of the effect of structural nonlinearities on the aeroelastic stability and wind response of cable-supported bridges. At first, the development of a new experimental apparatus for nonlinear section model tests of bridges is discussed. Then, the results of nonlinear section model tests conducted using the experimental apparatus are presented. Three different suspension bridge configurations are tested. The first one is for a single-box girder suspension bridge, and the second and third ones are for two twin-box girder suspension bridges having different span lengths. By comparing the results of linear tests to those of nonlinear tests, it is possible to assess the effect of structural nonlinearities. It is found that structural nonlinearities can have an effect on the critical velocity for flutter.

AB - Fire hazards are generally considered to be one of the major disasters that cause damage to grid structures, and when exposed to fire, their mechanical properties will directly affect whether the structure is safe. In this paper, the failure mode, strain analysis, load-displacement curve, initial axial stiffness, bearing capacity, and ductility of the joint are analyzed by the tensile testing of stiffened welded hollow spherical joints exposed to fire. The results show that the failure of the joint exposed to fire is a pull-out failure. With increasing temperature, the initial axial stiffness and bearing capacity of the joints gradually decrease. The ductility of joints exposed to fire shows an increasing trend with increasing temperature. The finite element model is verified based on the experimental results. Through parametric analysis, the calculation method for measuring the bearing capacity and initial axial stiffness of tensile-stiffened welded hollow spherical joints exposed to fire are proposed.

AB - Drywall partition wall systems have become one of the most common forms of construction for partition walls in multistory buildings around the world. Drywall partitions are usually attached to the surrounding structural framing and consequently experience damage as the building moves due to wind and earthquake actions. The damage occurs at very low drift levels, sometimes lower than the design limits set by the current standards. This paper presents an innovative solution for constructing drywall partition walls, which allows the system to be uncoupled from interstory drift within the building. This allows the system to undergo large interstory drifts without sustaining damage. Further, it also allows the system to be ‘quieter’ under smaller serviceability drifts, thereby addressing the creaking problem of partition systems, which has become an issue in recent times in flexible high-rise buildings. The assessment of these systems needs to be performed using three-dimensional assessment methods, due to the interconnected nature of the walls. This has been performed using the Multi-Axis Substructure Testing System at Swinburne University of Technology, which allowed full-scale 3&nbsp;m x 3&nbsp;m square room test specimens to be assessed experimentally. The results show superior seismic performance and improved acoustic performance of the newly developed system when compared to traditional partition wall systems.

AB - Computer-numerical-control (CNC) fabrication of interlocking plate timber structures is a novel construction method that allows to build structural elements without mechanical fasteners: the load transfer mainly relies on direct contact and friction between the composing panels. In this work, the lateral load capacity of shear walls formed from interlocking CNC cut plywood elements is investigated for the first time by means of experimental testing. The experimental campaign comprises four full-scale 5.4×3.1  m wall specimens with and without window openings, and component tests on shear connectors and pegged connections that resist uplift at the base of the wall. A simplified analytical model is proposed and calibrated to capture the response of the wall specimens. Satisfactory agreement with the experimental results in terms of vertical and horizontal displacements can be found, but it is clear that the component tests on the holding-down pegs capture only part of the flexibility of the connection of the wall to the base, and a parameter calibrated based on the full-scale wall tests is required to represent the measured behavior. The failure load can be predicted with reasonable accuracy where failure is initiated by the hold-down connectors.

AB - The combined action of steel and concrete in composite beams is accomplished via shear connectors that prevent slip between the two materials. In a fire event, the performance of these shear connectors may be impacted, hence affecting the strength of composite beams during and after a fire. This paper investigates the residual strength of channel-type shear connectors exposed to elevated temperatures. Twenty-two push-out specimens were fabricated with normal-weight and lightweight concrete and channel heights of 60, 80, and 100&nbsp;mm. The specimens were tested without any heat exposure or after experiencing maximum temperatures of 400, 600, or 750°C. Results showed that temperatures up to 400°C did not cause a noticeable change in the residual strength of shear connectors, but on average, normal-weight concrete specimens exposed to 600°C and 750°C showed 17 and 31 percent decrease in their residual strength, respectively. Relatively similar strength reduction was observed in lightweight concrete specimens. Equations used in AISC 360-22 and CSA-S16-19 specifications provided reasonably accurate estimates of the capacity of unheated specimens but were excessively conservative for heat-exposed specimens. Finite-element models of the specimens were developed and validated based on the measured load-slip behavior of the specimens in preheating and postheating conditions.

AB - This paper develops a horizontal displacement estimation framework for wind-excited high-rise buildings based on limited measurements of accelerations and strains and applies it to reconstruct the displacement responses of a 600-m-high skyscraper in Shenzhen, China, during Super Typhoon Mangkhut on September 16, 2018. A field measurement study was conducted to verify the reliability and effectiveness of the framework based on the acceleration and strain responses of the skyscraper during Typhoon Kompasu. Then, the horizontal displacements of the skyscraper during the passage of Mangkhut were reconstructed by the framework based on the measurements of accelerations at one floor and strain responses at four floors, and the accuracy of the reconstructed displacement responses was subsequently validated in both time and frequency domains. In the final, the along-wind and across-wind responses as well as the resonant and background components of the reconstructed displacements during the extreme typhoon event were investigated. This paper aims to provide useful information for structural health monitoring and wind-resistant design of supertall buildings in tropical cyclone-prone regions.
