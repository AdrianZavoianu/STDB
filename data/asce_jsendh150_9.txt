AB - ACI 318-19 and ASCE 7-22 specify code-compliant and emulative seismic force-resisting systems (SFRS) including intermediate precast shear wall systems. For the seismic design of a precast shear wall system, its successful performance heavily depends on the capacity design of inevitable discrete connections between precast wall panels, thus playing a critical role in controlling yielding to occur within steel reinforcements at the vicinity of intended locations or components. This is imperative for achieving not only ductility but also adequate energy dissipation, ensuring the system can effectively withstand seismic forces. To this end, the overstrength is essentially required to prevent any brittle failure, and the connections designed not to yield can be protected by addressing the 1.5Sy condition as specified in ACI 318-19 and ASCE 7-22. However, there can be a blind spot for the precast connections designed to yield. To this end, this study showed some cases based on practical examples from which a reasonable magnitude of overstrength (Sy) was tentatively recommended for better safety in the seismic design of the intermediate precast shear wall system with precast connections designed to be yielded.

AB - To improve shear capacity, as well as reduce on-site casting and steel consumption, a novel Y-shaped perfobond rib (Y-PBL) shear connector with ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) grout was proposed. The shear behavior of the Y-PBL shear connector was investigated by six groups of pushout specimens. Their failure modes, load–slip curves, load–separation curves, strain analysis, and shear transfer mechanisms were discussed. Subsequently, finite-element analysis (FEA) models were established to study the effect of parameters on the shear behavior of the Y-PBL shear connector, as well as to compare the shear capacity contributions with straight-shaped PBL (S-PBL) shear connectors. Analytical models were proposed to predict the shear capacity of the Y-PBL shear connector. The results reveal that the proposed Y-PBL shear connector has superior shear capacity and stiffness. The contribution of the perforating rebar is minor compared with the end-bearing effect of UHPC. The analytical predictions agree well with the experimental and FEA results. This study can be used to guide the design and application of the Y-PBL shear connector in steel-concrete composite bridges.

AB - The state of Hawaii is a series of mountainous islands with a topography that is much more complex than the simple isolated hills and escarpments included in ASCE standard ASCE/SEI 7-22 (Minimum design loads and associated criteria for buildings and other structures, ASCE 7). Hawaii state and county building codes have incorporated topographic wind speed mapping since 2007. In 2010, ASCE 7-10 recognized Hawaii as a special wind region. The design wind speed maps, Kzt maps, and site-specific directionality factors as adopted in Hawaii’s state building codes constituted the “special Kzt topographic effect adjustments” of the authority having jurisdiction that were referenced in ASCE 7-10. In ASCE 7-16 and ASCE 7-22, microzoned wind speed maps for Hawaii, including the effect of topography and directionality, were incorporated for strength design return periods. This paper provides information on the development of an improved generation of higher-resolution basic design wind speed maps for the state of Hawaii, including better accuracy of topographic and directionality effects. The digital format of these wind speed maps can be readily incorporated into the ASCE 7 digital hazard tool interfaces.

AB - Two methods to predict the pushover response of a hybrid steel braced frame that features concentric and eccentric connections are presented. The proposed hybrid frame configuration is intended for cold-formed steel (CFS) building structures and plays a dual role by providing gravity and lateral load resistance. The hybrid system features CFS columns for resisting gravity loads, tension only CFS straps connected concentrically to hollow structural steel (HSS) chords for resisting lateral loads, and prestressing strands connected eccentrically to the same HSS chords for further enhancing lateral load capacity. The first pushover response prediction method employs a nonlinear finite element modeling protocol that features only beam and truss elements. This method is presented as an alternative to three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear finite element models, which require considerable modeling effort due to the multitude of the components included in the hybrid system, and the variety of interactions that would need to be defined. The second method includes closed form equations that allow the definition of the pushover curves using manual calculations and is appropriate for preliminary analysis. Formulations for predicting the initial in-plane system stiffness, and secondary stiffness are presented. Similarly, formulations for predicting the load to cause the first and second yield as well as ultimate lateral load capacity are provided. A closed form equation is presented to obtain the ultimate lateral displacement, which completes the definition of the pushover curve. The validation of the proposed pushover response prediction methods is conducted by first comparing responses from 3D nonlinear FEA to those obtained from the simplified FEA model. Similarly, predictions from the simplified FEA model are compared to those obtained from the closed form equations. Good agreements are noted in both cases. The influence of hybrid steel braced frame aspect ratio on system push over response is quantified. The contribution of each lateral load resisting element to lateral load capacity is presented as a function of aspect ratio. Finally, improvements in behavior and enhancements in lateral load capacity offered by the hybrid frame-wall compared to the traditional strapped wall system are demonstrated through monotonic pushover, cyclic pushover, and response history analysis.

AB - The failure mode of concrete columns in subway stations during seismic events can be affected by the dynamic fluctuation of the axial forces. This study conducted quasi-static tests with bidirectional loading on three scaled rectangular columns to investigate the influence of highly variable axial compression ratio (ACR). A detailed analysis was conducted of the impact of the highly variable ACR on the column failure mode, reinforcement strains, and hysteretic behavior, and the repairability assessment was discussed. Numerical analysis of the effect of ACR variations was carried out based on the experimental results. In these experiments, the failure modes of central columns in Dakai Station, Japan, during the Kobe earthquake were reproduced, and three columns exhibited compressive-bending-shear damage and compressive-bending damage. As the ACR varied up to three cycles during one horizontal loading cycle, the hysteresis curve of the columns exhibited notable asymmetry. Furthermore, with a large variation of ACR amplitude, the stirrups of the column were fractured due to excessive shear effects. The bearing capacity, energy dissipation, and stiffness degradation of the columns were significantly adversely affected. A reparability assessment of the columns, based on the distribution of reinforcement strains, residual displacements, and concrete damage, is proposed. The effects of varying frequency and amplitude of different vertical ACRs on the hysteretic behavior of columns were analyzed numerically.

AB - The building industry requires the development of a ductile lateral force resisting system made of mass timber to help mass timber to continue to grow in popularity as the primary structural building material. The OpenSees framework was used to develop a numerical model of a single-story timber frame with a timber buckling-restrained brace, which was validated by the results of a previously completed series of quasistatic cyclic timber buckling-restrained brace (TBRB) component and subassembly tests. The experimental validation included a model developed for the hysteretic behavior of the TBRB and the rotational capacity of beam–column joints made with mass ply lam (MPL) panels, two slotted-in steel plates, and a number of steel dowels. The single-story model TBRB braced frame was then expanded to a numerical model of an eight-story mass timber buckling-restrained braced frame. The TBRB frame was analyzed with static pushover, quasistatic cyclic loads, and earthquake simulations. During the simulation of eleven design-level earthquake ground motions, the building experienced a peak interstory drift at of 2.54% at the first-floor level and a peak floor acceleration of 1.7g at the roof. The numerical model developed in this research of a timber buckling-restrained braced frame with TBRBs is novel and could be used to design timber buckling-restrained braced frames as a ductile lateral force resisting solution for mass timber buildings in seismic regions.

AB - In this paper, an innovative hamburger-shaped eddy current damper (HSECD) is presented to mitigate the responses of civil structures subjected to wind excitations. The damper’s capacity to dissipate energy is significantly enhanced through a two-phase configuration of permanent magnets (PMs) and two transmission devices: a ball-screw assembly and a bevel gear group. The improved eddy current damper (ECD) solves the problem that the low damping density of traditional ECDs hinders their application to the field of vibration control for civil structures. First, the construction details of this novel HSECD are elaborated, and its principle is discussed through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Subsequently, a prototype of the HSECD was fabricated, and cyclic tensile–compressive tests were conducted to investigate its mechanical performance. Furthermore, the temperature effect on the damper’s maximum output force was analyzed, and more than 10% performance degradation was detected in tests with a continuous loading of 1,250&nbsp;s, while the damper performance quickly reached a steady state after a certain decline. A theoretical model of the HSECD was then established to simulate its hysteretic characteristics, and the accuracy was verified by comparing it with the test data, where their energy error was only 1.9%. Finally, the application of the HSECD to both a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) simplified system and a jacking engineering system demonstrates its excellent control performance because the reduction ratios of their peak displacement were as high as 31.1% and 40.9%, respectively. These results highlight the significant practical value of the HSECD in mitigating the wind-induced vibrations for engineering structures.

AB - Backbone curves were generated from previous physical lab tests conducted on identical full-scale RC components utilizing different loading protocols (slab–beam–column and column specimens). These curves were subsequently compared with those prescribed in ASCE 41. It was observed that there was a substantial difference between the two, with ASCE 41 backbones (based on standard tests) showing significantly lower ductility capacity compared to backbones from tests using a loading pattern representative of earthquake demands, leading to a near-collapse condition. A four-story archetype RC building was analyzed to assess the influence of different backbones on its seismic response. The analysis revealed that using backbones representative of earthquake demands produced a median spectral capacity somewhere from 25% to 50% greater than that obtained using ASCE 41 upper bound backbones. Similarly, for drift capacities at incipient collapse, it was found that using backbones representative of earthquake demands resulted in a median capacity somewhere between 1.6 and 2.9 times that of using ASCE 41 upper bound backbones. These differences are significant, implying that ASCE 41 can be overly conservative by rejecting buildings that would otherwise be acceptable if ASCE 41 criteria were based on tests using protocols representative of earthquake demands. Examination of the time-history responses of the study building revealed that earthquake demands were predominantly characterized by relatively few large drift excursions having a one-direction bias. Standard protocols differ significantly from responses observed during actual earthquakes, as they feature numerous symmetrical fully reversed cycles of drifts with progressively increasing amplitudes that are much more demanding. This leads to overly conservative ASCE 41 criteria (too pessimistic). It is concluded that future component lab tests must include protocols representative of earthquake demands to achieve more accurate estimates of component behaviors. Use of such protocols will lead to more appropriate (less conservative) ASCE 41 building evaluations, aligning more consistently with the philosophy of performance-based earthquake engineering.

AB - A fragility-based probabilistic framework is proposed for the optimal design of friction pendulum (FP) bearings in seismically isolated liquid-storage tanks. The isolation period and sliding friction coefficient of the FP system, which significantly influence the seismic performance of isolated liquid-storage tanks, were analyzed as the two design parameters of the isolation system. The seismic fragility functions of the isolated tanks, generated using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), were evaluated and used to determine the optimal ranges for these design parameters. This procedure, which yields the minimum seismic failure probability of the considered structures, was examined in the design of seismic isolation systems for two on-grade cylindrical steel storage tanks with broad and slender configurations. Moreover, the effects of including or excluding the failure mode corresponding to the excessive displacement of the isolation system from the considered failure limit states were analyzed and discussed. Finally, the present study provides recommendations for the optimal selection of design parameters for FP isolators in liquid-storage tanks.

AB - Metallic dissipators have gained considerable attention in the seismic structural design industry in recent years because of their ability to provide stable hysteresis behavior and excellent energy dissipation capacity. Among these dissipators, the U-shaped flexural plate (UFP) has gained wide acceptance. This research primarily focuses on the numerical modeling of UFP and its innovative application, known as the multiple UFP dissipater (MUD). The research methodology involves conducting finite-element analysis of both the single UFP model and the MUD model under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions using Abaqus. The numerical models were validated against the experimental results. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the local deformation behavior of UFP during rolling motion, including the variations in the yield area and stress distribution at critical cross sections. Additionally, a parametric study was performed to investigate the influence of various geometric parameters, such as the section modulus and the slenderness ratio of the flange of UFP. The numerical model of MUD enables a comprehensive understanding of how different components within MUD function as an integrated unit. Furthermore, the relationship between the overall stiffness of MUD and the stiffness of each individual component within the system was discussed.

AB - Together with axial and flexural actions, modern-designed reinforced-concrete walls can also be subjected to torsion during rare loading events, such as large-magnitude earthquakes or strong winds. For certain widely used nonplanar open cross-section geometries, this torque is resisted primarily through warping. In some cases, the longitudinal stresses caused by torsional warping can be of the same order of magnitude as those caused by flexure, which postulates a reduction of the in-plane bending moment capacity of the section. This study explores the reduction of bending moment capacity of open reinforced-concrete U-shaped core walls due to the simultaneous application of flexural, axial, and torsional loading. Initial investigations focused on strain gradients through the wall segments of reinforced-concrete U-shaped walls. Using a refined data set from a recent experimental campaign, the commonly assumed linear strain gradient used in the design of reinforced-concrete walls is challenged. Numerical methods that intrinsically rely on the observed strain gradients are then employed to compute, for a range of torque-to-bending-moment ratios, the ultimate bending moment and torque capacities from combined loading scenarios. The numerical results corroborate existing experimental results, indicating a significant reduction (almost half) in ultimate bending moment capacity when a torque equal to approximately 20% of imposed bending is applied. Interaction diagrams between the ultimate torque and bending moment show that it is possible to derive a simple relationship between the two for the purposes of structural design. These results can help formulate guidelines for future international building codes, which in their current form cannot account for the design of open sections governed by warping torsion.

AB - A set of seismic analysis and design requirements are presented to improve seismic stability of steel two-tiered eccentrically braced frames (EBFs) with I-shaped link beams. The proposed requirements include strength, stability, and stiffness provisions for braces, intermediate beams, and columns. In particular, these requirements aim to make use of intermediate beams to limit out-of-plane deformation of diagonal braces, torsionally brace the link beam in the intermediate level using diagonal braces, utilize column stiffness and strength to brace the intermediate beam out-of-plane, estimate and account for in-plane bending demands of the columns due to uneven yielding of the links, and control inelastic link rotation. The proposed special analysis and design requirements for two-tiered steel EBFs prevent excessive out-of-plane deformation of the intermediate beam and columns, promote sequential yielding of link beams, and limit inelastic rotation of the link in the tier experiencing the largest lateral deformation. The proposed requirements are demonstrated for a case study two-tiered EBF. Nonlinear static and dynamic analyses are performed to evaluate the seismic response of the case study frame against the frame designed without special design provisions and to validate the proposed requirements.

AB - This paper aims to evaluate the seismic response of multitiered buckling-restrained braced frames (MT-BRBFs), assess the design provisions specified by the 2022 AISC Seismic Provisions for multitiered BRBFs, and propose improvements to these provisions. A set of 17 frames is first selected by varying bracing configuration, frame height, number of tiers, and tier height ratio. The frames are then designed in accordance with the 2010 and 2022 AISC Seismic Provisions. A numerical parametric study is performed under scaled ground motion accelerations. The results of the parametric study show that when the frames are designed to the 2010 provisions, the frame inelastic deformation tends to concentrate in the tier(s) undergoing tensile yielding due to their lower postyield stiffness, compared to BRBs yielding in compression, which creates unequal story shear, contributed by braces, in adjacent tiers with BRBs in tension and compression and engages column flexure to compensate for unbalanced brace story shears between tiers. Columns experience yielding and even buckling in several cases due to combined flexural and axial load demands. MT-BRBFs designed to the 2022 AISC Seismic Provisions exhibit a more uniform deformation response between tiers and relatively lower flexural demands in their columns. However, these provisions may overestimate column in-plane flexural demands (on the order of 3), resulting in potentially uneconomical design solutions. On the basis of the numerical simulations, modifications are proposed to compression BRBs’ adjusted strength to better estimate column in-plane flexure and tier deformation while achieving an economical column design. The proposed improvements are validated using dynamic analyses.

AB - Four different composite coupling beam-to-composite plate shear wall (CPSW/CF) connection details were developed and proposed. Six large-scale specimens representing the four connections were designed, fabricated, and tested. The connections were subassemblies of coupled composite plate shear walls/concrete filled (CC-PSW/CF) subjected to cyclic lateral loading. The coupling beams were designed to be flexure-critical with clear span-to-depth (Lb/d) ratios of 3.5 or 5.1. This paper presents the experimental program, capacities, and detailed behavioral observations of all six specimens. The effects of connection type and Lb/d ratio on the ultimate strength, stiffness, ductility, and failure modes are evaluated. Major limit states and events included yielding of the steel plates comprising the coupling beam, followed by local inelastic buckling, fracture initiation in the base metal (near the weld toes), and fracture propagation through the beam flange and web plates, leading to loss of flexural strength and failure. All the connections were able to develop and transfer the flexural capacity of the composite beam section. The composite coupling beams developed flexural capacities (10%–50%) greater than those calculated using the plastic stress distribution method. The underlying reasons for this overstrength are evaluated. The AISC flexural stiffness equation for filled composite sections could reasonably estimate the stiffness of the composite coupling beam sections. A fiber-based model of the cross-section was used to calculate the section moment–curvature response of the filled composite beam sections. The calculated flexural capacities were consistent with those calculated by the plastic stress distribution method but lower than the experimentally observed values. The flexural stiffness values were slightly higher than the experimental results. For more accurate comparisons with experimental results, a numerical model is needed to estimate the cyclic lateral load-deformation response while accounting for the effects of local buckling, low cycle fatigue, and fracture.

AB - This study explores the possibility of using low yield point steel (LYPS) as the material for seismic retrofitting braces without casing. While buckling restrained brace has commonly been considered for LYPS applications, it is demonstrated that a more effective usage of LYPS can be achieved without the casing, which not only provides economic advantages but also facilitate a more complete utilization of the excellent ductility of LYPS. In developing design procedures for noncasing LYPS braces, calculations for stability, such as those related to compactness requirements and buckling strength, become a major concern, as seemingly too optimistic values are obtained for them when using LYPS with a particularly low yield stress. Therefore, both monotonic and cyclic loading tests were first conducted to extend the current stability-related provisions to LYPS. Cyclic test results confirmed the outstanding hysteretic performance of noncasing LYPS braces compared to those fabricated from ordinary steels. Using the results from the cyclic tests and additional test-validated numerical analyses, a nonlinear static procedure was developed for the seismic evaluation of noncasing LYPS braces. This procedure includes guides for performing a pushover analysis for the retrofitted structure and setting the acceptance criteria. The developed seismic evaluation procedure is demonstrated through a case study, in which a steel moment-resisting frame is retrofitted with noncasing bracing. Noncasing braces made of LYPS are shown to be effective in improving seismic performance, whereas those made of ordinary steel are shown to be inferior for seismic retrofit.

AB - To enhance the accuracy of dynamic monitoring based on the global navigation satellite system real-time kinematic (GNSS-RTK) technique, an improved hybrid denoising method was proposed in this study. The improved hybrid denoising method is composed of a Type II Chebyshev high-pass filter, improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN), and wavelet soft threshold denoising. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) was applied as a judgment to identify the noise of GNSS-RTK caused by the multipath effects and the receiver’s internal error in the proposed method. A simulation signal containing noise was designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) obtained by the proposed method was 7.1619&nbsp;dB, which was the largest among the results obtained by the Chebyshev filter, ICEEMDAN, and the proposed method. The root-mean square error (RMSE) obtained by the proposed method was 3.3&nbsp;mm, which was the smallest among the results obtained by the Chebyshev filter, ICEEMDAN, and the proposed method. The SNR and the RMSE proved the proposed method outperformed the Chebyshev filter and ICEEMDAN. GNSS-RTK stability experiment revealed the noise of GNSS-RTK caused by the multipath effects and the receiver’s internal error. Compared with the signal obtained by wavelet denoiser, the signal obtained by the proposed method was more uniformly distributed around the ideal signal and had a smaller displacement range in the GNSS-RTK stability experiment. It demonstrated the proposed method was more suitable than wavelet soft threshold denoising for GNSS-RTK monitoring denoising. The proposed method was applied in a super-high-rise building with a structure height of 596.2&nbsp;m. The results demonstrate the proposed improved hybrid denoising method has a significant effect on noise reduction in monitoring the super-high-rise building based on GNSS-RTK. The results also present that the vertical dynamic deformation of the super-high-rise building is greater than the planar dynamic deformation. The first-order natural frequency obtained from processed monitoring data was 0.1926&nbsp;Hz. The difference is only 1.37% compared with the result obtained by finite-element analysis (FEA). It proves the reliability of the proposed method in monitoring super-high-rise building based on the GNSS-RTK technique.

AB - Functional recovery is a new, nonstandardized building design objective, intended to improve a building’s capacity to maintain or rapidly restore basic intended functions after a natural hazard event. Current building seismic design standards, which target life-safety performance objectives, provide limited requirements to ensure buildings maintain, or rapidly recover, function after earthquakes. Therefore, the expected functional recovery performance that is provided by current building codes is unclear. To provide clear and systematic insights to inform the development of prescriptive and performance-based design standards, this study documents the functional recovery performance for a set of 60 reinforced concrete archetype buildings. The results indicate that the estimated functional recovery time for reinforced concrete buildings designed to life-safety standards may approach 1&nbsp;year, on average, for design-level earthquakes. Additionally, while increased strength and stiffness requirements significantly reduce the likelihood of a building being marked as unsafe due to structural damage, additional design provisions for nonstructural components are required to ensure a high confidence of rapid recovery. The findings from this study clarify the expected post-earthquake recovery of modern reinforced concrete buildings and identify key trends in underlying damage and response mechanisms required to improve future building performance.

AB - Progressive collapse is a phenomenon where initial local failure of a component spreads to surrounding components, resulting in the collapse of the entire structure or most of it. This research is based on the component method (joint simplification model) and the hierarchical shell element macromodeling approach (composite floor simplification model). A three-dimensional spatial composite structural model was established using the finite-element (FE) software ANSYS/LS-DYNA. Experimental results were used to validate the reliability of the FE model. Based on these methods, a typical prototype structural model designed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was established, and a computational analysis of progressive collapse due to component removal was conducted. The results showed that the occurrence of structural collapse depends on the type of beam-column connection, floor level, and type of component removed. Also, it was found that structural collapse is more likely to occur when interior columns, gravity columns (nonresisting lateral column), and low-floor columns are removed. After column failure, the path of vertical loads is mainly transmitted to the columns within the area of direct collapse effect. The area within the potential collapse effect is also exposed to a severe impact phenomenon due to falling floors. Based on the collapse modes and internal force transfer path, an innovative collapse-prevention design method (structural response-based design, or SRBD) is proposed. The SRBD method predicts the collapse response of structure at a theoretical level and avoids redundant modeling and nonlinear calculations in collapse-prevention design. A comparison with collapse response of the NIST model shows that the prediction accuracy is approximately 90%. The SRBD method provides guidance for structural engineers in progressive collapse-prevention design.

AB - Conventional reinforced concrete shear walls are vulnerable to strong earthquakes with significant residual deformations, which substantially affect structural service and can even lead to structural collapse. Superelastic shape memory alloys (SMAs) are advanced materials that can realize strain recovery upon unloading. If SMAs can be used as reinforcing bars in structures, they can undergo large deformation without permanent deformation. This study presents a complementary and synergistic material system that integrates SMA with damage-tolerant engineered cementitious composites (ECCs) to minimize residual displacement and mitigate concrete damage. This study explored the seismic performance of shear walls using SMA and ECC in the plastic hinge region. Reverse cyclic loading tests were performed on four specimens to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. The specimens included a conventional steel-reinforced concrete shear wall (SW-R-C), steel-reinforced ECC shear wall (SW-R-ECC), SMA-reinforced concrete shear wall (SW-SMA-C), and SMA-reinforced ECC shear wall (SW-SMA-ECC). The results show that the SW-SMA-C specimen exhibited remarkable self-centering capability of more than 85% even after a large deformation, compared to SW-R-C. Furthermore, reduced damage and better ductility were observed in the SW-SMA-ECC specimen in addition to reduced residual displacement. The proposed approach indicated that SMA combined with ECC is more effective in mitigating plastic hinge damage and minimizing residual displacements, which could improve the seismic performance of shear walls.

AB - Designing a fully modular building, which is without the support of any separate lateral resisting elements, has the advantage of rapid site assembly, but runs the risk of a brittle style of connection failures in a rare earthquake event. Thus, this form of construction is currently limited to low-rise buildings. Isolating the building from its base and allowing the rocking motion to occur has been proven to be effective in dissipating energy and prolonging the natural periods by the lifting of the structure, thereby alleviating high strength demand on the building itself. To avert overturning, the amount of the rotation of the building needs to be controlled, and the use of superelastic tendons as a restraint is a promising solution. Previous studies into the seismic performance with this novel form of construction have been limited to experimenting with a rigid block or a single lumped mass system. In this study, this approach of seismic isolation is extended to a high-rise modular building with distributed mass and stiffness. A scaled-down model of a 19-story fully modular building, which was partially restrained by superelastic tendons, was tested on a shaking table. The key objective was to study the deflection profile and distribution of internal forces up the height of the superelastic tendon–restrained building and examine the contributions by the higher modes. The internal forces predicted by the analytical model developed in the study are shown to be in good agreement with experimental measurements. Modular construction shortens construction time and reduces environmental impacts. Currently, fully modular buildings, which have a high degree of prefabrication, are limited to low-rise constructions because of concerns over the overturning risk in major earthquake events. A new seismic safe design employing a superelastic tendon is introduced in this article to extend fully modular construction to high-rise buildings. The building is designed to rotate about its base when subjected to high intensity ground shaking. The amount of rotation is controlled by the superelastic tendon in order to avoid overturning from occurring. Meanwhile, internal forces taken up by the structural elements within the building were kept much lower than a conventional fixed base building. The dynamic testing of the miniature model of a 19-story building on the shaking table was featured in the study, which laid down principles that are essential for the formulation of effective guidelines for the structural design of this type of building.

AB - To obtain a precise finite-element model (FEM) for analyzing the dynamic response of corroded beams at high temperatures, a stepwise FEM modification strategy is proposed based on the improved extreme learning machine. Three concrete beams were designed and cast, and the dynamic response characteristics of corroded concrete beams at room temperature and high temperature are discussed. Firstly, electrical accelerated corrosion tests and vibration tests were conducted on simply supported beams at room temperature. The fundamental frequencies of concrete beams under different corrosion ratios were measured. The attenuation law of fundamental frequency with corrosion ratio also was studied. Subsequently, the FEM under different corrosion ratios was modified. The bond-slip between steel bars and concrete under different degrees of corrosion was considered during the correction process. Finally, a vibration test at high temperature was performed. The modal attenuation law of corroded beams at high temperatures was analyzed. Based on the modified FEM, numerical analysis at high temperature was performed. The proposed FEM modification strategy and the study of the attenuation regularities of modal information under fire exposure provide a foundation for further research on the damage development of corroded reinforced concrete (RC) beams under fire exposure.

AB - Angle profiles belong to the most common steel profiles used in several types of civil engineering structures, such as in lattice towers. Although, in such towers, they are usually considered as axially loaded (truss) members, an additional bending moment develops due to the eccentricity between the point of load application and the gravity center of the profile. Therefore, this paper focuses on the buckling resistance of single-angle members subjected to combined compression and bending. The investigations have been performed through numerical parametrical studies and have been compared to different normative documents where interaction equations are provided.

AB - Tropical cyclone (TC) winds control design wind speeds for much of the eastern United States. Those winds are likely to intensify with climate change, but climate change was not considered in the ASCE 7-22 design wind speed maps, potentially causing many structures to be designed with unacceptably high levels of risk. In this study, we investigate (1)&nbsp;the increases in design wind speed due to climate change; and (2)&nbsp;the resulting risk to structures if climate change is not considered. We estimated the design wind speeds for US counties affected by TCs along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts using nonstationary methods based on a set of synthetic TCs (1,000–1,500&nbsp;year simulations) downscaled from the latest global climate projections (CMIP6) for the high-emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5). It was found that over the 21st century, 50-year return period winds would increase by an average of around 10% along the US Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Depending on the risk category, design lifetime, and year of construction, design wind speeds (targeting lifetime exceedance probability) are projected to increase by an average of 3%–6% for all counties studied and 6%–15% for coastal counties. For Risk Category II–IV structures, depending on the design lifetime and year of construction, 8%–36% of all counties studied and 25%–66% of coastal counties would experience projected lifetime exceedance probabilities that were at least two risk categories too low; for example, in up to 26% of all counties studied and 54% of coastal counties, a Risk Category III structure would be effectively designed as Risk Category I or lower.

AB - A steel brace is effective to retrofit old reinforcement concrete (RC) buildings by increasing the horizontal load capacity of structures. However, concrete cracks that easily occur in the surrounding RC members under tension initiate early strength degradation, so this research aimed to develop a new self-centering brace (SCB) with the compression-only capacity such that no tension force is developed in the brace or to the adjoining RC members. Original SCBs have been developed to reduce the residual deformation of structures with a symmetrically flag-shaped hysteretic response. By altering the force transfer mechanism in the original SCB, a compression-only self-centering brace (C-SCB) can be developed under a symmetrically reversed cyclic loading, providing an alternative for the RC building retrofit. This paper first introduces the mechanics and deformation mechanism of the proposed C-SCB. A test program is then conducted on the cyclic tests of a buckling-restrained energy dissipating bar (EDB) to evaluate the energy dissipation. A 3,695-mm-long C-SCB is composed of posttensioning high-strength steel tendons, steel compression members, and buckling-restrained EDBs for the energy dissipation. The C-SCB in tests showed a good compression-only self-centering capability up to an axial displacement of 31&nbsp;mm, with a maximum axial force of 1,530&nbsp;kN. No damage of the steel tendons, compression members, or EDBs was found after three phase tests. Finite element analysis further validated the compression-only hysteretic response and mechanics of the C-SCB in a symmetrically reversed cyclic loading.
