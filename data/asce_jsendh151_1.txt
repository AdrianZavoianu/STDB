AB - Doors and other openings inevitably change the internal force distribution in cold-formed steel-framed gypsum partition walls (hereafter referred to as partition walls) subjected to lateral loading, which affects their seismic behavior. Some studies have evaluated the seismic behavior of partition walls with and without doors, along with other variables, through experiments. Still, research on damage mechanisms remains preliminary, with only qualitative discussions. Existing numerical models of doorless partition walls limit the simulation of partition walls with doors. Therefore, this study examines the influence of doors on the in-plane seismic behavior of partition walls. Quasi-static full-scale tests of partition walls with and without doors are conducted to evaluate the influence of a door alone and to display the deformation and stiffness associated with the door. The damage mechanism encompassing rigid-body motions and deformations is quantitatively evaluated using data from potentiometers and an image-based displacement measurement system. Parametric analysis is performed for a validated numerical model of the partition wall considering the door construction and detailing. The results enable the industry to improve the seismic behavior of partition walls with doors.

AB - In this paper, a probabilistic methodology based on image analysis for identifying the postearthquake performance level of reinforced concrete shear walls is proposed. A databank of 270 surface crack maps of 87 rectangular reinforced concrete shear walls obtained from quasi-static experiments at different drift ratio values is employed to develop the methodology. The specimens included within the databank exhibit a diverse range of structural design parameters and geometric properties. The complexity of the surface crack patterns is extracted by succolarity, lacunarity, and generalized fractal dimensions of the images of specimen images. For a specific fractal geometry index, fragility functions are developed to determine the probability of exceedance from an ASCE 41-17-compliant seismic performance level. Four typical probability distributions are used to generate the fragility functions: lognormal, gamma Weibull, and beta. Two goodness of fit tests including the K–S test and the Lilliefors test are used to assess the fragility curves’ fitness. The results show that, among the fractal geometry indices, succolarity has the best goodness of fit results, and the Weibull distribution fits the most seismic performance levels. In this study, seismic performance level indices are developed to optimize the goodness of fit by combining generalized fractal dimensions, lacunarity, and succolarity. A damaged wall specimen not in the databank at available performance levels is selected to present the application of the methodology. The results are also compared with other deterministic approaches available in the literature. By using the proposed methodology, the seismic performance level can be projected without the requirement for the structural characteristics data that are usually unavailable for seismically damaged buildings in the aftermath of an earthquake by only relying on image-derived data.

AB - To maximize the amount of carbon-sequestering mass timber and demonstrate the potential for mass timber across a range of building types and scales, DIALOG and EllisDon have developed a hybrid timber floor system (HTFS) that is composed of post-tensioned (PT) concrete beams, cross laminated timber (CLT) panels, and concrete topping connected to each other through self-tapping screws and kerf plates. This paper presents the fire performance of this novel HTFS through a combination of testing and modeling. Two mid-span sectional specimens of HTFS without concrete topping were exposed to the standard fire of CAN/ULC S101. The char depth and char rate of CLT were measured, and the temperature at specific locations were recorded to verify the design and the developed advanced finite element models. Advanced 2D models were developed to investigate the influence of steel properties and the effect from concrete spalling, and the modeling approach adopted in the refined 3D model. The developed models can estimate the char depth with difference less than 5%, and the temperature in reinforcing bars, PT duct, and concrete comparable to the average of the test results. The experimental and simulation results give an insight into the fire performance of this novel HTFS.

AB - Significant tornado events have prompted a push for the development of design standards that consider tornado loading for conventional buildings and structures. One important loading parameter in the design standards is the variation in the horizontal wind speed with the height (i.e.,&nbsp;wind speed profile) as manifested in a velocity pressure profile. Different from the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) in which the wind speed monotonically increases with height, the average wind speed profile in tornadoes exhibits a “nose-like” profile for which the wind speed increases from the surface to a local maximum at “nose” height and then decreases above that height. A tornado task committee (TTC) was convened through the ASCE 7 Wind Load Subcommittee, in part to report on the collection, review, and analysis of tornado wind speed profile data and to propose a “design” tornado velocity pressure profile for inclusion in the new tornado load chapter of the ASCE 7-22 standard. A total of 36 tornado profiles were evaluated independent of terrain exposure or surface roughness and collected from mobile radar data. Significant variability was noted in the profiles, but many showed a peak horizontal wind speed relatively close to surface, with a median height of approximately 164&nbsp;ft (50&nbsp;m). A proposed tornado velocity pressure profile and associated velocity pressure exposure coefficient, KzTor, was then developed for ASCE 7-22. The proposed nominal tornado profile closely followed the median radar profile. Values of the new KzTor=1.0 between ground level and 200&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;m) decrease linearly to 0.9 at a height of 328&nbsp;ft (100&nbsp;m) then remain constant above that height.

AB - Modern wind turbines are often supported by tubular steel towers made from globally conical, locally cylindrical shells with relatively large diameter-to-thickness ratios—approximately between 100 and 300—which enables the tower material to be used as efficiently as possible. Wind turbine towers face complex loading resulting from both environmental and operational load cases and are sensitive to geometrical imperfections that inevitably arise during the fabrication process. Whereas bending often controls at the base of turbine towers, the upper sections are controlled by combined bending and torsion. Although extensive studies have been conducted on the stability and design of cylinders subjected to isolated actions, investigations into the structural response of thin-walled cylinders under combined actions, such as bending and torsion, remain limited. To address this knowledge gap, an experimental program was carried out to study the structural behavior of thin-walled steel cylinders under combined bending and torsion. A total of 48 cylinders were tested with varying diameter-to-thickness ratios and torsion-to-moment ratios found in wind turbine towers. To gain insights into the imperfection sensitivity of these tests, a laser scanner was used to measure the geometric imperfections of each specimen before testing. The test setup, instrumentation, loading procedures and structural response of the cylinders, including ultimate resistances, load-deformation characteristics, and failure modes, are reported. The primary objective of this study is to provide benchmark test data for the validation of numerical models and the development of advanced design methodologies, such as reference resistance design (RRD), for cylindrical shells under combined bending and torsion. Future work will involve formulating guidelines for using laser-scanned data to evaluate geometric imperfections, developing laboratory- and full-scale wind turbine tower finite element models, and ultimately providing improved design guidance on combined bending and torsion.

AB - A generalized model that can be used to determine service level electric overhead traveling (EOT) crane skewing forces for the design of crane runways is proposed. The model has various characteristics that address deficiencies in current skewing force guidance. These characteristics include the ability to model any common EOT crane configuration; direct output of skewing force magnitudes and directions at the bridge wheel tractive surfaces; incorporation of the runway girder and its lateral stiffness to enable evaluation of skewing forces at any crane bridge location; inclusion of rational crane inertial forces; and quantification of service level bridge drive forces. Two existing cranes were experimentally investigated, and finite element analyses performed to validate the model, which showed that the proposed approach performed significantly better overall than the current Association for Iron and Steel Technology guidance for developing skewing forces. Using the model, a parametric analysis was conducted to determine skewing force coefficients for ten common crane configurations. The proposed model improves the accuracy of the approach suggested by current design guidance, which may not accurately specify service level crane skewing force magnitudes and directions. Overhead cranes produce skewing forces on the runway that act perpendicular to the direction of crane travel and cause fatigue stresses. As North American design codes do not quantify crane skewing forces in detail, a model of the combined crane and runway system is proposed that can be used to determine detailed crane skewing forces with any three-dimensional frame analysis program. For normal crane operating conditions, current design guidance for crane skewing forces generally underestimates service level skewing force magnitudes and does not correctly specify skewing force directions for all types of overhead cranes. This affects crane runway member and connection fatigue design. A more accurate determination of crane skewing forces results in more reliable crane runway designs.

AB - This paper presents the extension of the cracked membrane model, developed originally for predicting the behavior of conventionally reinforced concrete members subjected to in-plane loading, to include the effect of fiber reinforcement. This mechanically sound model combines the tension chord model with appropriate compatibility conditions for membrane elements, and thus expresses equilibrium at the cracks and yields explicit information on the crack spacings and kinematics. The model can readily be extended by incorporating well-established constitutive models for the crack-bridging fiber stresses. In its general formulation with fixed cracks, the extended model accounts for the interaction of crack-bridging fiber stresses and aggregate interlock and can capture crack sliding failure mechanisms as observed in experiments on fiber-reinforced concrete members with anisotropic or uniaxial bar reinforcement. The response predictions were validated against the experimental data of all shear panel tests available within the existing literature that contain fiber reinforcement. The model predictions correlate very well with the load–deformation behavior of the panels, including shear strength, corresponding deformation and failure modes, confirming the general applicability of the general model for a wide range of fiber contents and concrete strengths. Additionally, a simplified version of the model considering rotating, aggregate interlock-free cracks was derived, yielding reliable response predictions for members with low amounts of fibers. While the global response is accurately predicted by the general model, experiments with direct and detailed measurements of the crack and kinematics and stresses at the cracks are scarce. Future studies should thus focus on validating the postulated stress transfer mechanism across cracks in membrane elements by relying on more tests with direct and detailed measurements of the kinematics and stresses at the crack.

AB - Geopolymer concrete is a green building material, and related research has been focused on the material level, with relatively few experimental studies conducted at the structural component level. In this paper, full-size reinforced geopolymer concrete beams were designed for fire testing and residual load tests after the fire. The influence of the initial crack width on the beams’ fire resistance performance was compared. The research results indicate that geopolymer concrete beams exhibit excellent fire resistance without experiencing bursting or spalling during a fire. After being exposed to fire, the reinforced geopolymer concrete beams maintain their load-bearing capacity well. Beams with an initial crack width of 2.3&nbsp;mm reach the serviceability limit state under faster time and smaller load conditions. Following this, a thermomechanical coupled finite element model was developed and validated. Through extensive parametric studies, the reinforcement ratio and fire duration were found to be significant factors affecting the residual load-bearing capacity of geopolymer concrete beams after exposure to fire. Finally, a method for calculating the residual bearing capacity of reinforced geopolymer concrete beams after fire was proposed.

AB - This paper reports on an experimental investigation of the out-of-plane bending behavior and capacity of cold-formed steel (CFS) stud walls sheathed with wood-based boards [oriented strand board (OSB) or plywood] by means of four-point bending tests on a series of 10 specimens. The tests simulated outward wind loading (suction), which subjects the free flange of the studs to compression. The key design parameters were systematically varied in the test program, including the material type and thickness of the boards, the thickness of the studs and tracks, the stud spacing, and the presence or absence of longitudinal seams, noggins and track sections. Material coupon tests and subassembly tests on the stud-to-board connections were also conducted. The observed failure mode typically consisted of lateral buckling of the compressed stud flange, partially restrained by the rotational stiffness of the screwed connections with the boards and accompanied by significant cross-sectional distortion, with superimposed local buckling. A comparative analysis of the flexural responses of stud walls under inward and outward loading was also carried out, using additional data from a previously conducted experimental campaign.

AB - The double-T moment connection is considered in the AISC Seismic Provisions for use in steel structures subjected to seismic forces. Nowadays, the use of double-T connections requires the use of hot-rolled T-sections, which limits the optimal design. Hence, if there is a need to increase the flange or web thickness, this can only be achieved by increasing the entire T-section size, providing oversized and costly sections. In this research, this issue is addressed by studying the use of double built-up T (DBT) moment connections. Two full-scale specimens, as a complement to the five specimens previously tested by the authors, one considering a web panel zone failure mechanism and the other with the failure mechanism controlled simultaneously by the web panel zone and beam plastic hinging (balanced failure), were subjected to cyclic loading using the protocol established in AISC Seismic Provisions. Then, seven numerical models in ANSYS were developed, to reproduce the conditions of the seven specimens tested. The results showed an acceptable behavior of the specimens when the plastic hinge in the beam is the failure mechanism criterion controlling the seismic design. The specimens with a weak connection reached a lower resistance in comparison to the specimens with a weak panel zone and balanced failure. However, all specimens were able to achieve a story drift ratio of 4% with significant strength. The numerical models were calibrated from experimental data. No failures in the welds were observed in the specimens tested, which included full-penetration and fillet-welded specimens; therefore, the use of built-up T-stubs is reliable if their design is performed using a capacity design.

AB - This study introduces a large-scale testing campaign on five suitably sized steel and steel-concrete composite plate girders subjected to web shear buckling. The focus of this investigation is on understanding the structural behavior of composite plate girders, the contribution of the concrete slab, and the composite action on the phenomenon of web shear buckling with almost no influence of the bending moments. Implementing an antisymmetric loading scenario, along with comprehensive state-of-the-art optical measurements, reveals that the overall shear resistance increased because of the concrete slab. These findings indicate that the current European normative rules require the application of a more advanced analytical model to provide accurate design results. Furthermore, although the influence of web slenderness and the aspect ratio is significant, the degree of shear connection is shown to have less of an impact on the ultimate load in plate girders in shear. Moreover, this study examines not only the overall structural behavior of composite plate girders but also delves into the deflected shape of the web panel, the formation and development of the tension field in the web, the creation of plastic hinges in the flanges, and the crack development and failure in the concrete slab. The aforementioned aspects help unveil the ambiguity behind the phenomenon of shear buckling in composite plate girders. This study provides essential insights into the behavior of steel and steel-concrete composite plate girders given web shear buckling conditions. The findings have practical implications for engineers and practitioners in the field of structural engineering, particularly those involved in the design and assessment of bridge girders and other large-scale structures. The research highlights the increased shear resistance and load-carrying capacity of composite plate girders compared with those of steel girders. The contribution of the concrete slab to the overall shear stiffness and the effective transfer of forces through shear studs are key benefits that can enhance the design and longevity of composite structures. By understanding these mechanisms, engineers can optimize the design of composite girders to achieve higher performance and safety standards. Additionally, this study reveals the significant influence of web slenderness and the aspect ratio on the ultimate load capacity, emphasizing the need for the accurate consideration of these factors in design codes. The findings suggest that current European design codes could be improved by incorporating more advanced analytical models that account for the concrete slab’s contribution and composite action. Overall, this research underscores the importance of considering composite action in girder design and provides a foundation for future improvements in structural design codes, potentially leading to more efficient and resilient infrastructure.

AB - Historic quay walls in many Dutch cities are supported by an array of vertical timber piles which run through soft soil deposits and rest on a sand layer, providing end-bearing support. As these structures experience horizontal loads, the foundation piles are loaded in bending. This is the dominant loading case of pile foundations of dams, lock heads, and sometimes bridge abutments as well. To accurately model and evaluate the timber pile foundations, a proper estimate of their bending properties is essential. Therefore the mechanical properties of existing spruce foundation piles, retrieved from a historic quay wall (1905) at Overamstel in Amsterdam, Netherlands, were studied. Six piles were subjected to a four-point bending experiment. The outer fiber stress was kept constant between the point loads, leading to a failure at the weakest cross section. Measurements of the curvature and force distribution were taken along the pile length during loading. In addition, biological decay in the outer layer of the timber piles, also referred to as the soft shell, was identified with microdrillings. Internal strains were measured successfully by gluing fiber-optic wires inside the soft shell of the timber piles. The experiments indicated significant variations in modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture across the tested population, but indicated a strong correlation. Modulus of elasticity averaged 16.5&nbsp;GPa with a variation coefficient of 0.30, whereas the modulus of rupture averaged 23.2  N/mm2 with a variation coefficient of 0.26. Bacterial deterioration was found to be independent of both the outer pile diameter and the location along the timber pile. The soft shell had an average thickness of 21&nbsp;mm, but it did not contribute significantly to the structural strength of the piles. This study could present a template for assessing the remaining service life not only of historic quay walls but also of other timber pile foundations under bending loads.

AB - This paper proposes a novel multiaxial plasticity model for 3-dimensional nonlinear static analysis of steel frame buildings with fiber-based beam-column elements. The proposed constitutive formulation is expressed within the framework of rate-independent metal plasticity and captures both the pre- and postpeak response of typical structural steel elements due to yielding and inelastic local buckling under monotonic loading. An initial yield criterion is selected along with newly developed evolution laws. The material response follows J2 plasticity under a tensile stress state. Under compressive loading, the developed constitutive relation incorporates softening to simulate the postpeak response of a member due to inelastic local buckling. The model relies on appropriate yield line mechanisms inferred from buckling analyses of steel plates with characteristic boundary conditions. The proposed constitutive formulation, which is implemented in an open-source frame analysis finite element program, is general and can be used to represent a wide range of softening phenomena. To tackle mesh dependency in the presence of a softening material response, a regularization procedure is developed for 3-dimensional fiber-based elements. Direct comparisons between the predicted and measured nonlinear monotonic responses of physically tested steel beam-columns suggest that the proposed formulation predicts accurately their deduced moment-rotation and the axial shortening-rotation relations. Moreover, the stress distributions across typical cross sections in the postpeak loading regime depict the importance of axial-shear-flexure interaction within a steel beam-column.

AB - This study used the coupled finite element algorithm (CEL) to numerically simulate the damage and displacement response of reinforced concrete beams subjected to close-range explosion loads with varying amounts of explosives (TNT). Five numerical simulations were performed and compared with the experimental data from the existing literature, and the comparison demonstrated a high level of consistency. Abaqus finite element software was used to create a three-dimensional solid model of the Eulerian region containing explosives and air. This model was used to validate the blast pressure wave and compare it with an empirical formula for blast pressure waves in an infinite domain, which confirmed the accuracy of the blast pressure wave values obtained using the CEL method. This study also highlighted the significant impact of the mesh size in the Eulerian region on the blast pressure wave values. The JH-2 constitutive parameters of C35 concrete were fitted to accurately replicate explosion experiments from the literature. A three-dimensional solid model of the reinforced concrete beam that corresponded to the experiment was developed, and the experimental explosion was successfully replicated. The numerical results indicate that the vertical displacement, damage length, damage depth, and damage area of the reinforced concrete beam closely align with empirical findings, which validates the scientific rigor and effectiveness of the numerical simulation approach. In addition, this study examined the impact of structural support systems on simulation accuracy. Constraint methods had minimal influence on the simulation outcomes of small components but significantly affected larger components. This paper introduces a novel research methodology for numerical simulations in explosion engineering and serves as a valuable reference for future engineering applications and response studies.

AB - Posttensioned (PT) cross-laminated timber (CLT) shear wall systems provide a low-damage seismic solution for mid-rise and high-rise timber structures in high seismic regions. Experimental testing of 8.6-m-tall PT-CLT shear walls with three different configurations—single wall (SW), double wall (DW), and C-shaped core wall (CW)—demonstrated that effective coupling actions could be achieved in double and C-shaped walls using strong and stiff vertical in-plane and orthogonal joints. This paper extends the experimental study through numerical simulation in a three-dimensional domain to perform parametric analyses and assess a prototype 6-story PT-CLT CW system. A model unit of a SW was developed and then assembled to construct models for DW and CW in a 3D domain. Validation of the model was carried out against the test data. The developed model offered reasonable predictions for wall strength, stiffness, tendon force variation, slip at in-plane joints, and accumulated energy dissipation. The model limitations included its inability to account for out-of-plane motions for SW and its tendency to underestimate slip at orthogonal joints, with errors not exceeding 20%. A further parametric analysis investigated the effect of altering the spacing of in-plane and orthogonal joints on composite action (CA) values, strength, stiffness, and hysteretic damping of CW systems. Results revealed a consistent impact of fastener spacing on CW system properties, regardless of using 90° or mixed-angle screws. Decreasing spacing improved lateral resistance but could reduce energy dissipation capacity. In particular, in-plane joint spacing had a more pronounced effect on the CW performance than orthogonal joints. The model was employed to assess the seismic performance of a 6-story PT-CLT CW composed of two C-shaped walls. Through monotonic and cyclic pushover analyses, alongside capacity spectrum method utilization, the study demonstrated the viability of PT-CLT CWs in design scenarios. The model exhibited the potential for analyzing PT-CLT CWs with different configurations within a 3D domain.

AB - Post-tensioned rocking mass timber walls (PT-RMTWs) have been established as a seismically resilient seismic force-resisting system for mass timber buildings with high potential. The literature is rich in experimental studies that show that mass timber walls exhibit rocking wall behavior but require supplemental damping systems to dissipate energy during an earthquake. In this experimental study, the dynamic seismic response of a recently introduced low-damage uplift friction damper (UFD) for PT-RMTWs is validated. Experimental tests were conducted as a separate payload project using the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) TallWood large-scale 10-story mass timber building shake-table test specimen. Tests were conducted at the NHERI Large High Performance Outdoor Shake Table at the University of California, San Diego. This paper reports the results of this experimental test program with the UFDs along with some limited comparisons to numerical results. First, the global response of the test building is presented. Second, local and global behavior of the UFDs installed on the test building is highlighted. Third, a comparison of building response with and without the UFDs of the test building is presented. Lastly, some limited comparisons are made with the experimental results with those predicted obtained from a nonlinear response history analysis of a numerical model of the test building. The reported experimental results show that the UFDs enhanced the seismic response of the test building quantified by increasing the lateral strength, reducing the peak interstory drifts, and adding energy dissipation.

AB - Debris damming forces of 1∶20-scale shipping containers freely accumulated against elevated coastal structure columns were experimentally determined to evaluate ASCE 7-22 tsunami-resilient design standards. Three inundation conditions were generated to represent Froude regimes estimated in posttsunami field studies. Three different column array densities and two different shipping container sizes were evaluated. A photogrammetric method was employed to estimate the submerged projected area of in situ transient debris dams from two synchronized camera perspectives. Relative to this experimental data, it was found that the ASCE 7-22 equation for simplified equivalent uniform lateral static pressure is conservative by a mean factor of safety of 14.6 and performs as intended given the prescribed scope. Similarly, the ASCE 7-22 equation for detailed hydrodynamic lateral forces yielded a lower mean factor of safety of 2.4 but maintained design conservatism across all tested experimental conditions, also performing as intended. Minimum closure ratios and overall structure drag coefficients serve as input values for these detailed hydrodynamic lateral design loads. The proportion of closure coefficients prescribed by ASCE 7-22 tend to be reasonably conservative in general, and any instances of experimental exceedance of these design values did not appear to affect the design conservatism of Eq.&nbsp;(3). Finally, drag coefficients for rectilinear structures prescribed by ASCE 7-22 appear unrepresentative of coastal structures, which tend to generate column-flow interactions and unbalanced hydrostatic conditions. It is therefore suggested that the flow resistance of such structures be quantified via a bulk resistance coefficient, indicated by recent literature as a more appropriate measure applicable to surface-piercing flow obstructions. Since the 2016 adoption of tsunami-resilient design standards in ASCE 7-16, debris damming design loads have yet to be thoroughly examined. The results of this experiment indicate that the application of hydrodynamic loading equations in ASCE 7-22 Section 6.10 is conservative across all tested experimental conditions. Debris accumulation on the seaward face of the modeled structure is generally conservative relative to the design proportion of closure coefficients, and instances of exceedance do not result in unconservative load prediction. Finally, drag coefficients for rectilinear structures may not capture phenomena associated with surface-piercing flow obstructions such as column-flow interactions and unbalanced hydrostatic forces. It is suggested that a bulk resistance coefficient be adopted to account for both form drag and surface effects of flow around elevated coastal structure columns. Accurate quantification of tsunami-induced loads is crucial to the design of critical and essential infrastructure located within tsunami inundation zones, especially vertical evacuation refuge structures.

AB - Reinforced concrete (RC) elements frequently undergo biaxial shear forces, for example, columns under seismic events and spandrel beams that support an inclined roof. Nonetheless, experimental testing of RC elements subject to biaxial shear deserved far less consideration, and even fewer attempts have been made to develop analytical models for the biaxial shear capacity prediction. This paper proposes a new resisting mechanism that extends the well-established variable-angle truss model in use for uniaxial shear to calculate the biaxial shear capacity of RC beams under monotonic loading and of RC columns under cyclic loading. The coefficients ruling the concrete contribution—for which new expressions were recently derived using a machine-learning algorithm in case of uniaxial shear—are straightforwardly adapted to the proposed biaxial shear resisting mechanism without supplemental recalibration. The accuracy of the proposed analytical formulation to predict the biaxial shear capacity of RC elements is assessed against new experimental results reported in the present study and those already available in the current literature. A comparative statistical assessment shows that the proposed analytical formulation is more accurate than alternative uniaxial shear capacity equations of technical codes applied to the biaxial case under the assumption of a quadratic interaction domain.

AB - Global buckling modes of cold-formed steel (CFS) unequal-leg plain angle (UPA) compression members are flexural–torsional buckling (FTB) modes due to their nonsymmetric cross section. Although the behavior of CFS equal plain angle (EPA) members under axial compression has been studied extensively, only limited studies in the literature have investigated CFS-UPA members. The results of an experimental study of CFS-UPA specimens under axial compression with fixed support conditions are presented in this paper. This is the first experimental investigation of CFS-UPA compression members in which the postbuckling strength in the FTB mode and global–global interaction between the first two FTB modes (denoted FT1-FT2 interaction) are demonstrated. The test specimens were grouped into three categories—Test A, Test B, and Test C—based on the elastic FTB load ratios of the first two modes (Pcrft2/Pcrft1), corresponding to low (Pcrft2/Pcrft1&gt;50), medium (5&lt;Pcrft2/Pcrft1&lt;7), and high (Pcrft2/Pcrft1&lt;5) FT1-FT2 interaction, respectively. The postbuckling strength of the FT1 mode decreases as Pcrft2/Pcrft1 decreases due to FT1-FT2 interaction. The design methods available in the literature were evaluated using the experimental results. The current effective width method and direct strength method are conservative, whereas a procedure proposed in the literature accurately estimates the strength of CFS-UPA members.
