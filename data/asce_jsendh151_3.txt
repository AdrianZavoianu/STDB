AB - In 2019, a major code change made by the American Concrete Institute incorporated the extensive usage and applications of high-strength steel reinforcing bars (HSRBs). The adoption of HSRBs was motivated by several factors, including the reduction in steel congestion and construction cost, gain in member strength, and reduction in the carbon footprint of reinforced concrete buildings. However, code adoption of HSRBs has lagged in masonry design, which is due to the absence of relevant analytical and experimental data. Currently, masonry design standards define the maximum allowable design stress for reinforcing bars at 420&nbsp;MPa (60,000 psi). This paper presents the first research study on HSRBs for structural masonry with a focus on the lap-splice demand for Grade 80 (550&nbsp;MPa) deformed bars. The research study included 22 contact lap-splice experiments in concrete and clay brick masonry, with test variables being the bar size, the lap-splice length, and the standard specification of the bars. A high-fidelity finite-element model was developed to simulate the bond-slip behavior of HSRBs in structural masonry and complement the experimental findings. Experimental and numerical results corroborated the technical feasibility of embedding Grade 80&nbsp;bars in structural masonry with reasonable lap-splice lengths, following revisions to the code design formulas. Furthermore, it was found that different standard specifications of bars present different lap-splice length requirements, a distinction that is not currently made by existing code provisions.

AB - The in-plane shear behavior of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) confined masonry walls has been studied considering only cantilever walls. In coupled walls, there are changes in the bending moments and axial forces of individual confined walls because of the presence of coupling beams. Those changes have not been considered in current shear design recommendations for AAC confined walls. The objective of this work was to study the shear behavior of coupled AAC walls. A total of four reduced-scale walls were tested under in-plane reverse cyclic lateral loads. In this study, 1- and 2-story-high coupled walls were considered. Coupled walls consisted of individual AAC confined walls and reinforced concrete coupling beams. Two aspect ratios were considered for the individual AAC confined walls. It was observed that the cracking pattern of the 1- and 2-story coupled walls was similar, respectively. The shear strength of individual AAC confined walls increased as the aspect ratio decreased, the shear span over the wall length ratio decreased, or the axial compressive force increased. Similarly, the shear strength and stiffness of coupled walls increased as the aspect ratio of individual AAC confined walls decreased and the shear span over the wall length ratio decreased. On the contrary, the drift ratio of coupled walls increased as the aspect ratio of individual confined walls increased and the shear span over the wall length ratio increased. A design shear strength equation was proposed for AAC confined walls. This equation is a function of the shear span over the wall length ratio. The proposed equation predicted well the experimental shear strength and can be used for cantilever and coupled AAC confined walls.

AB - This paper investigates the static and fire resistance behavior of a new type of composite beam, consisting of prefabricated concrete slabs with reserved grout holes connected to steel sections using steel studs. It reports the detailed results of two ambient temperature (reference) tests and eight full-scale standard fire resistance tests, all conducted under four-point bending. The key variables in the tests were degree of shear connection (complete or partial), heating duration (by using unprotected or protected steel sections), and load ratios (0.7 or 0.3). The experimental results confirm that the oversized grout holes facilitated easy construction and had no adverse effects. Due to using solid slabs without steel decking, shear failure of the concrete slab may happen under concentrated load with wide spacing between shear connectors. Nevertheless, this did not affect the bending resistance of the beams. The current design methods for static and fire resistance calculations for conventional composite beams in Eurocode 4 are generally applicable to this new type of composite beam, including calculations of equivalent steel stud and concrete temperatures and plastic design assumption. However, the assumption in EN 1994-1-2 about uniform temperature distribution in the steel section did not accord with the measured steel temperature results.

AB - This paper presents the laboratory testing, numerical modeling, and structural design of aluminum alloy unequal-leg angle sections after exposure to fire. A testing program was carried out which included heating tests, postfire material tests and unequal-leg angle stub column tests. Eight different levels of elevated temperature exposure were considered ranging from 25°C to 550°C. The testing program was supplemented by finite-element analysis, in which numerical models were developed to simulate the postfire behavior, and the test results were adopted to validate the modeling approach. Then parametric studies were conducted to develop a deeper understanding of the influence of a number of important parameters on the postfire behavior. The experimental and numerical results were compared to various international design codes, and the continuous strength method, the latter of which is the only method which accounts for the effects of strain hardening in the material in the capacity predictions. The results from the design analysis indicate that the existing international standards generally yield underpredicted postfire capacities for aluminum alloy unequal-leg angles after exposure to elevated temperatures, especially between 300°C and 550°C. The continuous strength method was shown to offer significant design improvement over the examined international codes for the postfire design of aluminum alloy unequal-leg angles, especially for stocky angles, mainly due to the consideration of postfire strain hardening.

AB - The railway station is a critical node in the transportation network. Accurately evaluating the postearthquake functional level of railway stations not only facilitates functional recovery but also provides a scientific basis for formulating emergency plans in earthquake-stricken areas. This paper analyzed the operation modes and functional implementation methods of railway stations, categorizing postearthquake functional levels into three categories: complete function, basic function, and functional failure. Based on state tree theory and focusing on the impact of signal equipment, the fragility index of signal equipment was established, and the basic components of each subfunction and the functional logic relationships between components were analyzed. A new state tree-based method for evaluating the postearthquake functional level of railway stations was first proposed. Using this method, a typical railway station was evaluated. The research results indicated that under seismic action, the hanging lamps, elevators, ceilings, and signal equipment in railway stations were more prone to failure, and the overall functional redundancy of the railway stations was relatively low. Therefore, it was recommended to enhance the seismic design of the railway station’s layer, strengthen the seismic structural measures of hanging lamps, elevators, and signal cabinets, and place important signal cabinets on the lower mezzanine of the railway stations. Addressing these weaknesses could significantly enhance the postearthquake functional level of railway stations.

AB - A full-depth deck panel (FDDP) system incorporating hidden continuous channels has emerged as a promising solution for accelerated composite bridge construction. However, the system has faced implementation challenges stemming from fit-up issues, particularly the interference between stud connectors and protruding bottom transverse reinforcement. This paper proposes an innovative deck-to-girder connection detail, addressing these concerns through the incorporation of normal-strength concrete (NSC) or ultrahigh-performance concrete (UHPC) shear keys along the hidden channels as a substitute for projecting bottom transverse reinforcement. Furthermore, four-point bending tests were conducted to assess the longitudinal shear performance of the improved precast deck panel systems. Experimental results revealed that shear keys effectively resisted longitudinal shear stress and maintained the composite action between steel girders and concrete slabs, functioning equivalently to the bottom transverse reinforcement. Steel fiber–reinforced keys created with UHPC grout substantially elevated the structural stiffness by mitigating the longitudinal splitting of precast panel systems. Moreover, insufficient top transverse reinforcement can induce premature splitting along the rows of stud connectors, and inadequate bottom transverse reinforcement may provoke longitudinal shear failure along the surfaces passing around shear connectors. Notably, the novel joint details allow for precast deck panel systems erected through the full-span precast method (FSM), which offers improved construction efficiency and structural integrity.

AB - Conventional buildings often face major repair challenges after earthquakes. Self-centering technology is an innovative approach that enables structures to resist seismic events with minimal residual drift by incorporating automatic recovery mechanisms, allowing the structure to return to its original position after an earthquake, thus enhancing seismic resilience and reducing the need for extensive repairs. This study presents an innovative self-centering beam technology aimed at enhancing earthquake resilience and limiting floor elongation during seismic events. Through an experimental investigation involving a 3-story steel frame, the research compares the performance of conventional frames (CFs) with that of self-centering frames (SCFs) equipped with self-centering devices at various beam-column connections. The comparative analysis reveals that SCF structures exhibit a consistent reduction in interstory drift ratios from the bottom to the top stories, in contrast to the fluctuating drift ratios observed in CF structures across different stories. Models with and without initial preload forces in the beams were also evaluated. Notably, the SCF-A model, which incorporates preload, significantly outperformed CFs in reducing drift ratios during major earthquakes. Conversely, the SCF-B model, devoid of preload, showed similar or increased drift ratios compared to SCF-A under moderate and major seismic events. The SCF structures, particularly those with reduced initial preload, displayed lower acceleration amplification and a modified acceleration distribution pattern. Their hysteretic behavior also contrasted with that of CF structures, with SCF-A demonstrating smaller yielding moments and SCF-B presenting fuller hysteresis curves when compared to SCF-A, yet less pronounced than those of CFs. In terms of base moments, SCF-A and SCF-B structures achieved reductions of 38.0% and 55.1%, respectively, under major earthquakes compared to their CF counterparts. The study concludes that preload force, damping devices, and column base types are crucial in self-centering structures’ design, influencing displacement, self-centering ability, and energy dissipation. This provides insights for future applications of SCF structures with the novel self-centering beams.

AB - There exist so many approaches to extract the time-varying mean (TVM) of nonstationary wind speeds under the nonstationary wind speed model, such as the wavelet transform and empirical model decomposition. These approaches yield different fluctuating wind components, resulting in significant differences in related wind parameters of fluctuating wind speeds (e.g.,&nbsp;turbulence intensity, turbulence integral length scale, and wind spectrum). Meanwhile, compared to the stationary wind speed model, the nonstationary wind speed model would lead to different predictions of wind loads and wind-induced responses of a tall building even under the same wind field. This paper first derives the theoretical relationships of statistical parameters between stationary and nonstationary wind speed models, including turbulence intensity, turbulence integral length scale, and turbulence wind spectrum across different models. Wind speed data recorded during Typhoon Mangkhut from September 15 to September 18, 2018, are analyzed to validate the derived relationships. The analysis results confirm that the turbulence intensities and turbulence integral length scales of fluctuating wind speed components under the nonstationary wind speed model are generally smaller than those under the stationary wind speed model. The response analyses of an actual tall building were conducted under Typhoon Mangkhut utilizing various wind speed models. Significant disparities in structural responses are observed between the simulated stationary and nonstationary wind conditions. This result indicates that for typhoon wind fields with noticeable nonstationary properties, the conventional stationary wind speed models may not adequately capture the full dynamic wind effects on tall buildings. Besides, improper extraction of the TVM and subsequent simulation of the nonstationary wind velocity field can lead to substantial discrepancies between the calculated structural responses and the true values. It is thus necessary to establish a nonstationary wind speed model with a proper TVM for the wind-resistant design of tall buildings under typhoons or other nonsynoptic wind environments.

AB - Load-bearing masonry is widely used in North America, offering architects various unit patterns, including running bond and stack bond, for both architectural and load-bearing purposes. However, stack pattern masonry in load-bearing walls faces additional design restrictions compared to running bonds. Many prefer stack patterns for their aesthetics but are often unaware of the structural limitations. These constraints originate from research on unreinforced or ungrouted stack pattern walls, with the misconception arising when horizontal reinforcement or continuous grouting is used. Thus, stack pattern walls may end up, after engineering design, being significantly weaker in flexure than running bond pattern walls. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the structural behavior of stack pattern and running bond pattern tall masonry walls under constant axial and varying out-of-plane loading. Three running bond patterns and three stack pattern reinforced concrete block masonry walls, each 4.0&nbsp;m tall ×2.4  m long ×0.19  m thick, were tested under combined out-of-plane bending and axial loading. The test data showed that the failure modes of stack pattern and running bond pattern walls are similar. This study found that the out-of-plane flexural capacity of the stack pattern wall is 8% to 11% lower than the counterpart running bond wall. However, the postcracking behavior of the stack pattern and counterpart running bond walls were found to be similar. Findings from this research suggest that changes to both Canadian Standards Association (CSA) S304 and TMS 402/602 provisions regarding stack pattern masonry are warranted. Load-bearing concrete masonry masonry construction, a popular choice in North America, offers architects the flexibility of using different unit patterns for both structural and aesthetic purposes. One common pattern is the stack bond, favored for its visual appeal. However, stack pattern masonry walls have historically faced more design restrictions than those in a running bond pattern. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the structural behavior of tall masonry walls in both stack and running bond patterns under varying out-of-plane load and constant axial load. Testing six concrete block walls, three in each pattern, the results revealed that both types exhibited similar failure modes. The study found that the out-of-plane flexural capacity of stack pattern walls was only 8% to 11% lower than that of running bond walls, while their postcracking behavior remained comparable. These findings suggest the need for revisions to current masonry design codes [Canadian Standards Association (CSA) S304 and TMS 402/602] concerning stack pattern masonry under out-of-plane behavior. We hope that the upcoming Canadian design standard CSA S304 will be updated based on the findings of this study. Such updates can better inform architects and builders when choosing between these patterns, ensuring both structural integrity and aesthetic appeal in construction projects.

AB - Steel buildings utilizing steel-concrete composite construction typically have large floor depths due to the concrete deck cast above wide-flange beams. Stay-in-place formwork is placed on the bottom flange to achieve shallower composite floor systems. This formwork comprises either concrete precast panels or steel deep decking, which supports a concrete topping slab that encases the steel beam. The goal is to minimize the floor depth, reducing the building’s overall height or increasing the floor-to-floor height. Currently in the United States, no readily available hot-rolled steel shapes allow for easy placement of stay-in-place formwork on the bottom flange. This necessitates intensive fabrication to create asymmetric beams and facilitate rapid placement of stay-in-place formwork on the wider bottom flange. This study aims to develop standardized hot-rolled asymmetric steel I-beams (A-shapes) for potential large-scale production in the United States. Utilizing A-shapes decreases the required manufacturing time and allows for increased speed and efficiency of residential building construction. The research presented herein includes beam sizing constraints established from interviews with three US steel mills. Utilizing the beam sizing constraints for manufacturing, a wide range of possible cross sections were investigated for three structural load cases. Each cross section iteration was analyzed for a total of 16 limit states to establish efficient and effective standardized A-shapes. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate sensitive limit states when altering assumed parameters. As a result of this study, two primary cross sections with a depth of 203&nbsp;mm (8.0&nbsp;in.) (A8s) were established for a 6.1-m (20-ft) square grid for a live load of 1.9&nbsp;kPa (40&nbsp;psf) and 4.8&nbsp;kPa (100&nbsp;psf). The heavier A8 cross section [when supporting 1.9&nbsp;kPa (40&nbsp;psf) live loading] satisfies all limit states for a beam length of 6.1&nbsp;m (20&nbsp;ft) and spacing of 8.5&nbsp;m (28&nbsp;ft), which allows for large open spaces between columns. The methodology developed was also utilized to size four additional A-shapes (two A10s and two A12s) and can be used to size A-shapes for other facilities.

AB - This paper presents an experimental program in which 16 full-scale clay brick unreinforced masonry walls were constructed and tested under in-plane cyclic shear loading. These walls have been divided into four sets of nominally identical specimens constructed with the same masonry units from the same mortar composition by the same mason and cured for a consistent period of time. The repeatability of these tests allows for the variability of the peak in-plane shear capacities of these wall configurations to be investigated. Furthermore, these tests were supplemented with material characterization tests, examining the tensile, shear, compressive, and elastic properties of the masonry utilized in this study. In addition, assessments of the accuracy of the current Australian standard for masonry design, as well as that of other expressions found in the literature, have been made. The findings of this analysis indicate that the Australian standard maintains significant limitations in its ability to correctly determine the shear capacity and failure mechanism of masonry shear walls. This error is reduced, but not wholly mitigated through the application of the deterministic equations present in the other design guides.

AB - Relatively few studies have explored the shear behavior of concrete deep I-beams. This study presents a series of 12 shear tests on concrete deep I-beams with shear span-to-height ratios (av/h) of 1.0 and 1.5. The effects of horizontal and transverse web reinforcement on structural deformation and shear strength are compared. The findings indicate that a minimum horizontal and transverse reinforcement ratio (ρv=ρh=0.28%) significantly enhances the shear capacity. Additionally, an increase in vertical reinforcement (ρv=1.26%) shifts the failure mode from shear tension to web crushing. Increasing horizontal web reinforcement has little influence on shear capacity at av/h=1.5, while it significantly enhances strength at av/h=1.0. The upper limit of shear strength for deep I-beams, as specified by ACI 318-19, appears conservative; a limit of 0.225fc′bwd is recommended. The Strut-and-Tie Model (STM) used in ACI 318-19 is conservative, demonstrating an average experimental-to-predicted shear strength value, Vexp/Vpred=3.24, with a standard deviation of 0.63. Conversely, VecTor2 exhibits an average Vexp/Vpred of 1.07, with a standard deviation of 0.10. The panel element-based model, such as Mau’s model, is proven suitable for the analysis of deep I-beams.

AB - In tall, single-story buildings with steel concentrically braced frame (CBF) lateral force resisting systems, it is more efficient to replace a single brace or pair of braces between the base and the story (roof) level with multiple bracing panels or tiers, leading to a multitiered braced frame (MT-BF). MT-BFs lack intermediate out-of-plane supports at the tier levels, and most of the building mass is concentrated at the story level, so their seismic behavior is more complex than typical multistory CBFs. Inelastic response in MT-BFs during a seismic event can cause drift concentration in an individual frame tier and increase the propensity for column instability due to combined axial and flexural demands. These unique conditions have been the focus of studies that support the first-generation of MT-BF design requirements introduced in the 2016 AISC Seismic Provisions. Requirements for multitiered ordinary concentrically braced frames (MT-OCBFs), which is the focus of this paper, were based on a limited investigation, and the primary feature of the requirements is an axial force amplification (150% of the overstrength horizontal seismic load effect), intended to account for induced in-plane flexural demands. Prior to the introduction of design requirements specific to MT-OCBFs, they were designed as multistory frames without considering flexural demands. This study uses detailed nonlinear models to assess the seismic performance of a comprehensive set of MT-OCBF designs. The results show that potential for column instability in MT-OCBFs is reduced in designs considering the new axial force amplification, and frame collapse probabilities are within acceptable limits. The 2016 AISC Seismic Provisions also introduced an out-of-plane notional load requirement (0.6% of the vertical component of the compression brace force at each tier), which was intended to account for effects from buckling compression braces. Since this requirement does not influence column proportioning appreciably, and since performance was acceptable for MT-OCBFs, where the columns were designed without an out-of-plane notional load, this study suggests that it can be removed. MT-OCBF column instability is primarily related to axial force and in-plane moment, and the axial force amplification that accounts for this combination in a simple fashion is satisfactory.

AB - This paper reports on the shear performance of a cold-formed steel (CFS) beam-to-beam moment welded moment connection with 28 laboratory tests. The tested moment connection comprises a welded CFS 90° clip angle (CA) and a flat-shaped CFS flange strip (FS) that connects the web and flange portions of the beam members. The observed failure modes in the tested samples, namely, (1)&nbsp;tearing failure; and (2)&nbsp;local buckling of the welded CA are classified based on the aspect ratio of the CA. A detailed parametric study was conducted on the ultimate shear strength of the welded moment connection for the variation in the thickness, width, and depth of the CA. The effect of the FS in improving the shear strength of the chosen welded moment connection over the welded shear connection was quantified, and design guidelines were suggested. Two design methods, namely, (1)&nbsp;empirical approach, which is specific only for the chosen moment connection, and (2)&nbsp;generic design approach, which applies to shear and moment connections, have been proposed. In this study, CFS welded moment connections are compared with CFS welded shear connections, and design recommendations are suggested.
