AB - To reveal the mechanism by which internal studs enhance the fatigue resistance of concrete-filled steel tubular K-joints (CFST K-joints) and to develop a method for calculating the stress concentration factor (SCF) of CFST K-joints with internal studs (CFST KS-joints), this study conducted full-scale specimen fatigue tests on CFST K-joints with array-arranged and circular-arranged internal studs. The influence of internal studs on the fatigue performance of CFST K-joints was thoroughly analyzed. The equivalent wall thickness theory was introduced, and the wall thickness correction factor was derived. A highly accurate SCF calculation method for CFST KS-joints was established. The research results indicate that the arrangement of internal studs can enhance fatigue life by 100.6% and reduce the SCF by 77.6%. Furthermore, the efficiency of circular-arranged studs is approximately twice that of array-arranged studs. When the undetermined factors mc for CFST K-joints with array-arranged and circular-arranged internal studs are set to 0.002 and 0.019, respectively, the maximum deviations of the wall thickness correction factor a are only 7.98% and 8.20%, respectively. Utilizing the equivalent wall thickness theory, SCF calculation methods for CFST K-joints with array-arranged and circular-arranged internal studs are derived, yielding errors of less than 19.6% and 21.4%, respectively.

AB - Squat reinforced concrete shear walls are commonly used as primary gravity and lateral load–resisting systems in structures. Such low aspect ratio walls respond to load in diagonal or sliding shear. A series of real-scale quasi-static cyclic shear wall tests with identical geometry were conducted at the Multi-Axial Subassemblage Testing (MAST) facility at ETH Zürich to identify the influence of the axial load ratio and the steel reinforcement ratios on the transition between diagonal shear and sliding shear controlled behavior modes. Two specimens failed in sliding shear, and the other two failed in shear, either in diagonal compression or diagonal tension. The tests showed that squat walls exhibiting a sliding shear failure remain stable under the applied axial load even at displacements corresponding to 2% drift ratio. On the other hand, the walls that failed in diagonal shear did so in a brittle manner at displacements corresponding to 1% drift ratio. However, walls that slid had large residual displacements. The values of the shear wall axial load ratio and the longitudinal and horizontal reinforcement ratios at the transition between shear and sliding were identified.

AB - The objectives of this study were to investigate the lateral torsional buckling performance of multi-ply structural composite beams to develop experimental procedures to understand their flexural and torsional rigidity that can be used to develop design guidance capable of reliably accounting for their composite capacity. Three 44.5  mm×457  mm×14.8  mm (1.75  in.×18  in.×48.3  ft) laminated veneer lumber beams were nondestructively tested more than 140 times in this investigation using a variety of single and multi-ply member configurations to determine their member stiffness about each primary orientation and joist orientation buckling controlled moment capacity. To allow a wide range of member slenderness to be evaluated, the moment capacity tests used Southwell techniques and single-span bending configurations with two-point loads to determine the critical buckling moment capacity (Mtest′) and torsional rigidity for two different member depths, two different spans, two different relative load point positions, and with up to three beam plies. Multi-ply headers were attached together with nails using a scheme that approximated the manufacturer’s minimum recommendations for applications without significant side loads. This study demonstrated that the measured lateral torsional buckling moment capacities were overpredicted where the multi-ply members were assumed to behave with the rigidity of a solid section and underpredicted where the members were assumed to behave as a collection of unattached plies. For the multi-ply beam loading conditions, nail attachment intensities, and bracing methods tested to near their full-scale buckling capacity in this study, Mtest′ was reasonably estimated using predictive calculations that explicitly accounted for torsional rigidity and assumed that the between-ply fastenings provided partial composite action with empirically derived efficiencies of 6% for torsional (GKJ) and 25% for plank orientation flexural (EpIp) rigidity. It was also found that the degree of multi-ply flexural EpIp composite action measured in the plank orientation flexural stiffness tests conducted under different loading and boundary conditions proved to be a poor predictor of relative lateral torsional buckling rigidity in the beam tests and was not correlated to the measured buckling resistance.

AB - This research assesses and compares the seismic performance of four reinforced concrete columns subjected to lateral cyclic loading. Two columns were reinforced with ASTM A955 Grade 75 reinforcement, whereas the other two were reinforced with CSA G30.18 400W reinforcement, each with aspect ratios of 3 and 6. This study aims to lay the foundation for future performance-based seismic design guidelines for reinforced concrete (RC) bridge piers reinforced with stainless steel rebars. This is achieved by delving into various aspects of seismic behavior, including hysteretic response, column ductility, energy dissipation, plastic hinge length, and performance damage states. The ASTM A955 Grade 75 columns showed similar hysteretic behavior to the CSA G30.18 400W columns up to 7.5% drift and ductility level of 4. At failure (20% strength degradation), the stainless steel columns demonstrated comparable drift ratios, albeit a lower overall ductility capacity due to their higher displacement at yield. In terms of energy dissipation, the CSA G30.18 columns showed higher energy dissipation at similar drift levels and at failure compared to the ASTM A955 Grade 75 columns. Evaluation of plastic hinge length prediction models revealed higher discrepancies for columns reinforced with stainless steel reinforcement, and further investigation is warranted. Also, performance damage states, including concrete cracking, cover spalling, stirrup yielding, bar buckling, and bar fracture, showcased material-specific responses and unveiled critical insights about the applicability of code strain limitations and prediction models for ASTM A955 Grade 75 reinforcement. The research emphasizes the need for tailored approaches based on the distinct behavior of stainless steel.

AB - Steel elements subjected to harsh environments can corrode and experience degradation in their performance, which could compromise the integrity of the structure. Ensuring the safety of corroded steel structures requires conducting a series of inspections and repairs, especially for critical structural elements. Traditional repair methods, while effective in many cases, involve extensive labor and are typically costly. Recent studies have proposed fiber-reinforced polymers as a cost-effective method to repair corroded steel cross sections. However, most of the studies did not investigate the effects of utilizing these repair materials on the entire structural performance, including ductility. In addition, these studies were focused on the use of carbon fibers with limited attention to the use of basalt fibers. Here, we conduct a series of full-scale experimental tests to investigate the impact of mechanical section reduction, representing corroded sections, on the flexural behavior of steel beams and the effectiveness of different repair materials in enhancing their structural performance. Two retrofit materials, including carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) and basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) sheets, are utilized. The results show that the flange and web section reduction lower the beams yielding load by 10% and 8%, respectively, compared with a beam with no section reduction. Utilizing CFRP and BFRP patches can partially restore the beams’ ductility; however, the BFRP is outperforming the CFRP in improving their ultimate strength by 10% and enhancing their ductility by 10%.

AB - The aging and deterioration of existing RC structures are often addressed with jacketing of weak structural members. This study proposes a blend of numerical methods to precisely simulate the interfacial bond performance in composite sections consisting of fresh and hardened concrete layers. A comprehensive experimental campaign of 75 direct shear tests was conducted, focusing on three key contributors to bonding strength: (1)&nbsp;surface roughness, (2)&nbsp;application of a bonding agent, and (3)&nbsp;the impact of interfacial compressive normal stresses due to confinement or external forces. The results indicated, as anticipated, that roughening benefits bonding capacity, and the bonding agent’s contribution was evident only on smooth surfaces. Regarding the effect of normal stresses, bonding performance was enhanced only up to a certain load. To further and more accurately analyze contact behavior, a novel numerical simulation integrates cohesion, friction, and plastic damage models in computer simulation and employs contact elements under explicit dynamic analysis. The proposed modeling technique efficiently accounts for various parameters, including roughness, concrete properties, and pressure on the interface, offering a versatile tool for analysis. Furthermore, a generalized optimized model has been proposed to complement the analytical simulations and categorize surfaces as either smooth or rough, with acceptable convergence, providing a practical, and robust approach for concrete-to-concrete contact modeling. The deterioration of existing infrastructure, combined with economic and sustainability concerns, have stimulated significant efforts to strengthen it. A key retrofitting technique known as jacketing involves adding a new stronger reinforced concrete layer externally to weak structural elements. A strong connection between the old and new concrete layers is crucial for transferring stresses effectively, although this is not always guaranteed. To enhance the connection credibility various techniques have been developed: (1)&nbsp;applying bonding agents, (2)&nbsp;roughening the old surface before adding the new layer, and (3)&nbsp;applying pressure to the interface to increase frictional forces. Experimental results showed that surface roughness improves bonding. Bonding agents are essential primarily on smooth surfaces, and their effectiveness diminishes as roughness increases. The impact of compressive normal stresses on bonding is noticeable up to a certain load level, beyond which this effect can diminish or even reverse. The most accurate, albeit quite complex, method to assess the behavior of these bonded sections is through numerical modeling. The proposed modeling approach provides researchers and designers with a flexible, highly analytical, and reliable tool for bond analysis. It also introduces a simplified version of this model based on the same principles, encouraging broader practical applications.

AB - The lead high-damping rubber (LHDR) bearing is one of the efficient rubber bearings with excellent energy-dissipation capacity. Similar to high-damping rubber (HDR) bearings and lead rubber (LR) bearings, the hysteretic behavior of LHDR bearings significantly changes at low temperatures due to the nonnegligible temperature dependence and heating effect. However, the complex heat-transfer mechanism in these bearings differs from that of HDR bearings or LR bearings owing to the interacted heating effect of the HDR laminate and the lead core. Additionally, the hysteretic behavior is affected by the loading rate. In this paper, a rate-dependent thermomechanical coupling hysteretic model was developed to illustrate the rate dependence and thermal mechanism in LHDR bearings. A thermomechanical model was proposed to explain the heating effect and heat transfer in HDR laminates, lead cores, and steel plates. A rate-dependent hysteretic model coupled with the thermal mechanism was then established to predict the hysteretic behavior of bearings. The hysteresis curves and temperature history were validated through the quasi-static cyclic loading with cooling intervals and real-time and pseudodynamic hybrid simulations. The temperature profile was predicted to directly depict the vertical temperature distribution of LHDR bearings. The proposed model achieved improved accuracy in the hysteresis curves and temperature history compared with the existing model.

AB - Squat reinforced concrete shear walls usually have diagonal shear– or sliding shear–controlled behavior. Due to the lack of experimental data, there is uncertainty on how squat wall design parameters define their behavior modes. Two real-scale tests were conducted at ETH Zurich on specimens of equal geometry and reinforcement, but different axial load ratios (ALR), employing hybrid simulation techniques to apply recorded ground-motion excitation in a quasi-dynamic manner. Specimen HSW01 had an ALR of 4.02%, whereas the ALR for Specimen HSW02 was 8%. Specimen HSW01 failed in sliding shear, exhibited a quasi-ductile behavior, developed a peak resistance of 2,730&nbsp;kN, and reached a displacement corresponding to a 3% drift ratio without losing the ability to carry its axial load. Specimen HSW02 failed in shear diagonal compression and lost the ability to carry its axial load at a horizontal displacement corresponding to a 2% drift ratio and a peak resistance of 3,360&nbsp;kN. The crack patterns, crack width, and damage progression observed in both tests are presented. Finally, the results were compared with similar specimens tested using a displacement-driven incremental symmetric quasi-static cyclic test protocol. Hybrid simulations using recorded ground-motion excitation did not affect the failure mode of the specimens but allowed them to sustain larger displacements than those tested cyclically.

AB - To address the sustainability challenges faced by concrete structures, various attempts have been made to optimize the reinforcement layout with a topologically optimized strut-and-tie model (STM). However, most studies have focused on theoretical discussions and the few available experimental studies have only discussed the prepeak behavior of optimized beams. The postpeak behavior, especially the ductility of beams with optimized reinforcement, has not been addressed, although it is one critical criterion for ensuring structural safety. Moreover, current topology optimization methods mostly adopt linear elastic material constitutive behavior, which neglects the intrinsic strength difference between steel and concrete material and has been found to cause low ductility in concrete beams. To address these challenges and enhance ductility with optimized reinforcement, this study proposes new frameworks for designing concrete beams with optimized reinforcement. The first framework enhances the elastic-material model-based optimized reinforcement layout with a postprocessing scheme to enhance concrete compression strut ductility. The second framework develops a new optimization formulation by introducing an asymptotic nonlinear material model, which considers both the stiffness and strength difference between concrete and steel material. An experimental and numerical program was conducted to compare the structural performance of concrete beams with optimized reinforcement from different frameworks. Results show that the new frameworks have limited impact on the peak strength but increase ductility of the optimized beams. Compared with the design from the conventional bilinear model, the design from the nonlinear model reduces steel consumption by 8.2%.

AB - Conventionally designed reinforced concrete (RC) deep beams often fail in a nonductile shear failure mode. A deep beam may embrace significant ductility through a careful layout optimization of the reinforcements, but this optimization intention still needs effective experimental validation. This paper presents such an experimental validation for two evolutionary optimization methods the authors developed recently: a single-objective evolutionary structural optimization (SOESO) aiming to achieve uniform stress in steel rebars and a biobjective counterpart (BOESO) with a secondary objective to create a smoother convergence by reviving some deleted reinforcement elements. Two specimens designed using the two optimization methods were statically tested. The loading-displacement curves of both specimens exhibited an apparent postyield plateau, confirming that both optimization methods can design ductile deep beams. In comparison, the BOESO beam outperformed the SOESO beam in the sense that the stresses of all rebars in the BOESO beam were closer to the yielding stress at failure, while most oblique rebars in the SOESO beam did not yield and the longitudinal rebars at different rows were uneven. Furthermore, the BOESO-designed reinforcement layout meets the design requirement of the bottle-shaped strut according to the strut-and-tie model (STM). The experiment results recommend using the BOESO method as a reference for future RC deep beam design.

AB - Mass timber is increasing in popularity all over the world due to the advantages such as shorter erection time and lower carbon footprint. However, unlike other commonly used construction materials such as steel or concrete, wood is a combustible material. Beam-to-column connections provide building stability, regardless of construction material. The structural integrity of these connections during a fire can help maintain stability of the building throughout a fire and thereby improve the structural performance of a building during fire. Glue-laminated beam-to-column connections typically utilize steel plates and screws to transfer force demands. The presence of steel within wood connections can increase the complexity of the heat transfer mechanisms and therefore char rates. In addition, during the cooling phase of a fire, thermal wave propagation can continue through the joint in addition to the potential for smoldering. Due to all of these complexities, a research program was conducted to test three different glue-laminated beam-to-column connections under fire conditions (both heating and cooling phases). This paper summarizes the results as well as makes recommendations for future research due to gaps in knowledge.

AB - The aerodynamic force coefficients prescribed in most codes and standards are an ensemble average of 10 or 20 10-min samples, which means that a fundamental uncertainty of 10-min samples cannot be properly considered. Thus, it also is very difficult to properly evaluate the uncertainty of wind load. In the present study, 10-min samples of fluctuating pressures on tall buildings with three side ratios were measured using wind tunnel tests. The probability density distributions of the aerodynamic force coefficients were evaluated first, and then new design parameters are proposed to properly evaluate the uncertainly of wind load. Calculation results indicated that the probability density distributions of local and generalized force coefficients follow a normal distribution, and the probability density distributions of peak pressure coefficients follow extreme value distributions. The positive peak pressure coefficients mainly follow a reverse Weibull distribution, and the negative peak pressure coefficients follow all the extreme value distributions depending on pressure tap positions and wind directions. The coefficient of variation of wind speed was found to have a larger influence on the adjusting coefficient than that of the non-exceedance probability of wind load. The coefficients of variation of the mean and fluctuating force coefficients were less than 0.1, and those of the peak pressure coefficients ranged from about 0.1 to 0.3, slightly larger than those of the mean and fluctuating force coefficients. Using the present results, aerodynamic force coefficients corresponding to the specific non-exceedance probability of wind load can be evaluated from the ensemble averaged values for square and rectangular tall buildings about 220&nbsp;m high at full scale under a wind environment corresponding to an urban area.

AB - Reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls are widely used as a seismic force–resisting system in nuclear facilities. Such walls are designed to be relatively thick with a few openings for radiation shielding as well as for blast and fire protection. These geometrical requirements typically result in low-aspect-ratio walls with high reinforcement ratios that are provided by two or more mats, leading to complex construction activities and high construction costs. The use of high-strength reinforcement (HSR) has the potential to address such constructability and economic issues by reducing the required steel areas and rebar congestion. However, because relevant nuclear design standards restrict the use of HSR in their safety-related structures, most previous experimental studies to date focused on investigating the seismic performance of nuclear low-aspect-ratio RC shear walls when only normal-strength reinforcement (NSR) was used. To tackle this knowledge gap, the current study utilizes the pseudodynamic hybrid simulation testing technique to experimentally compare the performance of nuclear low-aspect-ratio RC shear walls with HSR and NSR when subjected to ground motion sequences. In this respect, two RC shear walls (i.e.,&nbsp;W1-NSR and W2-HSR) with an aspect ratio of 0.83 were tested, where both walls were designed to have a similar lateral strength; however, Wall W2-HSR had a reduced reinforcement ratio of 1.23% compared with Wall W1-NSR, which had a reinforcement ratio of 2.20%. The two walls were subjected to several ground motion records to investigate their force-displacement responses, lateral strengths, ductility, stiffnesses, deformation capacities, cracking patterns, rebar strains, and failure modes. A numerical model was then developed and experimentally validated to simulate the response of the two test walls under such ground motion records. The results show that both walls achieved similar ultimate strength values; however, relevant nuclear design standards were not able to accurately estimate these values for Wall W2-HSR. In addition, although Wall W2-HSR had wider cracks relative to Wall W1-NSR during all ground motion sequences, the former wall achieved a high displacement ductility value without any premature brittle shear failure. The experimental results presented in the current study are expected to facilitate the adoption of HSR in low-aspect-ratio RC shear walls within nuclear construction practice.

AB - The current AISC specification (AISC 360-22) does not permit using high-strength materials in steel plate-concrete composite (SC) walls due to limited research. This paper uses three steps to address this. In the first step, experimental tests on 13 high-strength SC walls are conducted. The test parameters are stud spacing, thickness of steel plate, yield stress of steel, and compressive strength of concrete. Results from the tests indicate that the axial compressive strength of SC walls increases when the material strength increases or when the slenderness ratio (i.e.,&nbsp;ratio of the stud spacing to the thickness of steel faceplate) decreases. In the second step, finite element (FE) models are developed and benchmarked. Parametric studies are then conducted to further validate the findings from the tests and to develop effective stress–strain relationships for the steel faceplate. The resulting effective stress–strain relationship can be used in fiber-based analysis programs for better accuracy, since it implicitly accounts for the influence of local buckling and yielding. Finally, the effective stress–strain relationship is used to revise the equation in AISC 360-22. The accuracy of the revised equation is verified using results from both the experimental tests and FE parametric studies.

AB - Viscoelastic damper (VED) reinforcement has been successfully implemented in Chuan-dou–type timber buildings in southwest China, a region with high seismic intensity. However, the development of analysis models for this reinforcement technique trails behind the requirements of engineering practice. In this study, experimental observations of quasi-static test results for mortise-tenon joints were investigated. The results show that mortise-tenon joints exhibit damage gaps under cyclic loading. Motivated by these observations, the geometric equations for the height of the embedded compression area were derived by considering the damage gap and the tenon’s construction forms. Equivalent stiffness and damping theories were applied to the physical conditions to describe the mechanical properties of VEDs. In the equilibrium equations, external loads were equilibrated by a combination of elastic force provided by a VED and interaction force between the tenon and mortise. Through linearizing the nonlinear segmented skeleton curve model, the new linearization model improves computational efficiency by requiring solution of only the key control points in the nonlinear model. A typical loading and unloading rule is proposed here, and a computational procedure for the proposed hysteresis model is presented in detail. By comparing the existing reinforcement test results for mortise-tenon joints with four construction forms, the proposed model is capable of predicting the hysteresis behaviors of these joints with reasonable accuracy. Further validation was conducted with a focus on the hysteretic behaviors of two Chuan-dou–type timber frames.

AB - Analyzing uncertainty or estimating statistics of load resistance of structures is crucial for reliability-based code calibrations, forming the foundation for modern limit state design. While design-code models can be used to estimate the load resistance of masonry walls against in-plane (IP) loading, it is widely recognized that these models are inherently inaccurate due to their simplifications, assumptions, or empirical features. Therefore, employing them for uncertainty analysis or statistics estimation can be challenging. On the other hand, detailed mechanics-based finite-element (FE) models and physical experimental tests are typically more accurate. Nevertheless, their application for uncertainty analysis or statistic estimation is often impractical due to their high computational or economic cost. To address this challenge, this study introduces improved estimators for mean and variance of the IP resistance of masonry walls after considering parameter uncertainties, by leveraging efficient design-code models and limited high-fidelity data generated from detailed FE models. In the proposed estimators, a large number of design-code model evaluations are introduced to improve computational efficiency, while only a limited number of FE model evaluations are integrated to ensure accuracy. Three case studies are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed estimators: one on unreinforced masonry (URM) walls and two on reinforced masonry (RM) walls. The results indicate that design-code model-based estimators exhibit large bias, and compared to the estimators that solely rely on the FE model, the proposed estimators achieve higher accuracy given the same computational budget.

AB - The time characteristics (TCs) of ground motions (GMs) significantly affect the seismic response of tall buildings; however, few existing GM selection methods effectively consider the impact of the TCs of GMs. This leads to noticeable uncertainty in the nonlinear response time-history analysis (NLRHA) results of tall buildings and substantial computational demands to secure a reasonable estimation of the structural seismic responses. This paper proposed a GM selection method considering the impact of frequency and time characteristics (SIFT) of GMs based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In the proposed SIFT method, the existing two-step GM selection procedure was adopted to select candidate GMs to effectively consider the site condition, GM duration, and impact of GM frequency characteristics. The proposed method developed the response diagram in the time domain (RDTD) to represent the impact of the TCs of GMs, which shows the relative magnitudes of seismic responses of single-degree-of-freedom systems with varying frequencies at any given moment throughout the duration of the earthquake. A CNN model was constructed and trained with transfer learning technique to learn the fuzzy features of the RDTD, establish the mapping relations between features of the RDTD and seismic responses of tall buildings, and finally select GMs from the candidate GMs. The proposed SIFT method and existing spectrum matching-based GM selection method were adopted to select GMs from different GM databases for the NLRHA of structures with different periods to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SIFT method. This method can ensure seismic responses calculated using fewer GMs are close to those calculated using a large number of GMs, thus considerably improving the computational efficiency of seismic assessment of tall buildings.

AB - In this research, the performance of the gusset plate moment connections is experimentally evaluated in a fire condition. To achieve the research goal, 12 specimens are fabricated in a symmetric cross arrangement; accordingly, a single column along with two cantilever beams and gusset plates are considered, and the load is applied at distance from the beginning of the beam. Subsequently, the temperature of the specimens is elevated until the point of connection failure is reached. The effective parameters, including the gusset plate thickness, gusset plate steel grade, vertical load value, gusset plate length, connection type (bolted or welded), gusset plate height, and lateral restraint, are examined. Following the completion of the experiments, time-temperature and temperature-rotation curves as well as failure modes are obtained. Ultimately, the results are compared with the control specimen. The findings indicated that the lateral restraint, the gusset plate steel grade, and the applied load have significant effects on critical and failure temperatures. Lateral restraint and yield strength improvement led to 20% and 10% increase in the failure temperature, respectively. Moreover, elevating vertical load up to three times can cause a substantial 23% reduction in the failure temperature. Last but not least, fire caused a significant change in the connection’s failure modes, where parameters, including length, height, and edge angle of gusset plate, played a crucial role. Finally, by comparing the proposed gusset plate moment connection with previous inquiry prequalified moment connections, it can be concluded that not only the examined connection is cost-effective but also offers satisfactory performance at high temperatures. Noteworthy, it holds the potential for further investigation in future research and application in steel structures.

AB - This paper investigated flexural behavior of composite beams with innovative bolted shear connectors. The novel bolted shear connector consisted of a long tube nut and its compatible bolt. The nut was cast in concrete, and through predrilled holes on the flange of the steel beam, the bolts were connected to the nut to achieve interaction between the steel beam and concrete slab. Using this bolted connection, the stress concentration in the tangible medium around the nut was reduced. The composite beam with the novel bolted connectors was built and tested in the laboratory. The four-point experiments were carried out to investigate the stiffness, strength, and ductility of composite beams with novel bolted connectors, and the experimental results were compared with that of the composite beam with conventional connectors. The interaction at the interface of the composite beams in the elastic stage was discussed according to the strain distribution of the cross sections. The finite-element (FE) model of the composite beam was established using the commercial software Abaqus and validated using experimental results. A series of parameter analyses were carried out using the validated numerical model, including the nut diameter, bolt hole clearance, bolt pretension, concrete strength, and connector spacing. The results show that composite beams with bolted connectors have better performance than those with conventional connectors.

AB - The use of steel plate reinforcement to improve the stiffness and strength of cross-laminated timber (CLT) was examined in this study. Double-shear lap tests were conducted to study the bond between wood and steel, and epoxy was determined to be suitable to bond steel to wood. Bond strength equations that limit plate thickness to prevent bond failure were proposed for use in panel design. Unreinforced, singly reinforced, and doubly reinforced panels were fabricated, with hybrid layers consisting of thin wood tie layers bonded to each side of each steel plate using epoxy, fabricated prior to panel assembly and used in a conventional panel manufacturing process. Panels were tested to failure under four-point bending in the out-of-plane direction. Steel plates in the test panels were 1.59&nbsp;mm thick, and the measured secant stiffness at initial peak load was 2.26 times larger for the singly reinforced panel and 3.46 times larger for the doubly reinforced panel relative to that of the 175-mm-thick unreinforced panel. Test results were compared with analytical results from the shear analogy method. For the reinforced panels, an improved fit between model and test data was found when neglecting shear deformation. A parametric study was conducted using the shear analogy method with shear deformation neglected, and the use of steel plate reinforcement for a practical range of parameters was shown to provide a significant increase in out-of-plane panel stiffness. In the parametric study, the decrease in stiffness for a singly reinforced panel relative to a doubly reinforced panel with the same total plate thickness was less than 6%. This modest decrease suggests that use of singly reinforced panels may be favorable in some instances because the singly reinforced panel offers the benefit of simplified construction.

AB - To investigate the anticollapse performance of a multistory composite frame (MSCF) under internal column-removal conditions, a static experiment using a one-third scale, three-story composite frame was conducted. This experiment utilized horizontal loading and specialized boundary-restraint systems. This paper undertook a comprehensive discussion that examined the MSCF’s load-resisting capacity, failure patterns, deformation behaviors, axial force generation, and load-transfer mechanisms. To better understand how different load-bearing mechanisms contribute to structural total resistance, the resistance contribution coefficients for the flexural and catenary mechanisms in double-span beams (DSBs) at various stories were introduced. The results showed that the boundary-restraint systems effectively simulated horizontal constraints on the extended beams across all stories. The axial forces in the beams of each story were unevenly distributed, a phenomenon attributed to the Vierendeel action (VA). The resistance contribution coefficients also varied by story, with values of 43%, 37%, and 20% from the bottom to the top stories. VA played a crucial role in the development of catenary action within each story beam, and its impact on the flexural mechanism was minimal. Finally, the experimental results in this paper were compared with those of prior experimental tests, including a single-story beam-column assembly and two multistory subframes. This comparison further validated the efficacy of experimental loading scheme for MSCFs, providing valuable insights for future collapse-resistance tests.

AB - A novel self-adaptive damper with load bearing, energy dissipation, and self-centering phased adaption performance, known as the “multifunctional phased self-adaptive rotational friction” (MFPSA-RF) damper, is proposed based on the multilevel seismic concept. This innovative damper consists of multiple MFPSA-RF joints and several corresponding connecting plates. Each MFPSA-RF joint comprises three friction plates clamped together by high-strength bolts with prestressed combined disc springs. The friction plates are specifically combined with two types of friction surfaces—planar and wedge-shaped—to enable the damper to exhibit graded self-adaptive behavior. The working mechanism of the damper is elucidated, and a theoretical analysis model is developed to describe its force–displacement relationship. Experimental studies on the damper components and the whole damper were carried out to test its hysteretic behavior and further validated the theoretical analysis model of the MFPSA-RF damper. The results demonstrated that the MFPSA-RF damper exhibits prominent adaptive performance with MFPSA performance, characterized by high stiffness in small deformations, stable energy dissipation in medium deformations, and excellent self-centering capability in large deformations. Furthermore, a mathematical hysteretic model based on the Bouc–Wen model is developed to capture the MFPSA characteristic, and the modified model’s predicted hysteretic behavior aligns well with the experimental results.

AB - This paper describes a recently compiled database of 100 full-scale steel beam-to-column connections that failed due to flange fractures. This database focuses on welded flange connections tested in the past 50&nbsp;years, including tests with strong panel zones and box columns that have been excluded from previous collections. This database is augmented with high-fidelity structural models carefully calibrated to the test data using a semiautomatic algorithm to extend the information from each experiment beyond the recorded response. Once calibrated, these models offer a versatile method to decompose the total displacement response of the connections in beam, panel zone, and column deformations and extract more detailed response quantities, such as the stress history of the flange. This augmented database enables a deeper understanding of the causes of flange fractures and an assessment of the common rotation limits in ASCE/SEI 41 employed for simulating fracture. The results show that these rotation limits have a considerably large error. Furthermore, these rotation limits are incapable of either identifying the flange that would fracture first or simulating the opening and closing behavior of a fractured flange. The stress histories of the flange extracted using the models is a more efficient demand parameter for characterizing fracture behavior. This database is openly available in the DesignSafe DataDepot and is immediately useful for researchers developing new models for beam-to-column connections susceptible to fracture and to practicing engineers interested in calibrating structural models for nonlinear dynamic analysis.
